this is just blatant corruption, when consumers have a choice the better product/business will win.  So instead of improving their business, they will just bribe our government so they dont have to compete with better companies. 
There are so many things wrong with this. Instead of killing this bill, which is a blatant attack on Florida craft beer (one of the state's fastest growing industries), the Florida Senate has decided to support AB InBev (a company based in Belgium, owned primarily by Brazilians) after receiving several thousand dollars in campaign financing from AB InBev lobbyists.

It seems AB InBev is too afraid to compete with craft beer in the market, so instead they would rather pay off politicians and legislate it out of a profitable existence.
I can buy a gallon of beer but it's illegal to buy a half gallon. How does that make any fucking sense???
Horrible. Being forced to "sell" your product to a middleman then buy it back at a mark up before you can sell to your fans. Disgraceful. I work in Vegas and for a smaller grocery store. We have an okay amount of microbrews but we didn't carry local. Our main distributor straight up stated because we DO NOT carry Bud, Miller or Coors on our shelves, we would not be able to sell Joseph James, Tenaya Creek, Chicago or Big Dogs. I guess over time with deals made or what have you, we were able to carry TC and JJ. Not their entire line but still something I could easily get my customers excited about. The 'Big Boys' are going to start pulling crap like this im sure. Their "microbrew" secret entities are failing so why not roll up the sleeves and get your politicians to do your dirty work? Sad.
this is a gross generalization I know, but middlemen in general annoy the shit out of me. Be it a car dealer or investment bank or in this case greedy distributors, it is a huge layer of cost for very little benefit.
I dont get the deal with lobbyists. Its like giving a voice to people who can pay for it while people who are poor cant do anything.
And these cheap dickbags wanted me to work on a photography project for them for $250/month.

I'd love to know InBev's annual advertising budget and how $250 was specifically set aside for 50 unique images per month for some advertising campaign.
>AB InBev, the largest beer company in the industry, has over 200 beer brands produced and sold throughout the world.

>Its global brands are Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois. Its international brands are Beck's, Hoegaarden (Belgium) and Leffe.

>In 2013 it had a net profit of 14.4 billion USD (including extraordinary items) on sales of 43.2 billion USD.

[List of AB InBev brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_InBev_brands).
Screw Budweiser!  They sell crap beer and want a state sanctioned monopoly.  Budweiser is like sex in a canoe, it is fucking near water!
They can take our voting rights,

They can take our money,

BUT THEY'LL NEVER TAKE... OUR CRAFT BEEEEEEER
  Y'all see the problem with lobbyist ? Congress is bought and paid for.
> "It's like paying protection money" to the mob, said Sen. Jack Latvala

I completely agree with the analogy.  (I'm just surprised so many people still drink crap like Bud.)
only one way to beat the man. don't buy his product. 
First they came for our laws & regulations, and I did not speak out...because I was not a law or regulation. 

Then they came for our politicians, and I did not speak out...because I was not a politician. 

Then they came for our craft beer, and there was no one left to speak out for me. 

Fucking lobbyists...
The title is inaccurate. It isn't AB InBev that is supporting the bill, but their distributors. Similar to passing legislation in IL. Any craft beer/homebrew law has to be cleared by the ABDI (Associated Beer Distributors of Illinois). Really goes to show that we really are in an oligarchy. The last homebrew law passed in IL was negotiated with the ABDI, congressional support after that is a mere formality.
And now after 8 years of drinking Budweiser consecutively I will no longer support them with my money.. 
Nothing like that good ole american freedom...  decided by corporations.  
  
Yee hawww...  Go merica!  Vote publican!  
  

Why does Budewiser care?  They don't even make beer.
Or they could spend money making better quality beer...

Probably been ten years since I drank that crap AB calls beer. Someone tried to give me a case of Budweiser a few weeks ago and I wouldn't drink it when it was free!
Gaetz is a funny man, that story is the stuff that makes Florida_Man happen. 
cant all the drug dealers just get along

I don't see an issue with selling bottles, cans, half gallon growlers, etc at the breweries but apparently. AB does?? This is just political bullying by the big dogs because they know their product is crap and the microbreweries are taking a good chunk of their market share. 

Contact your state representative in FL and let them hear your voice. 
The beverage industry is trying to take a huge dump in the Colorado legalized weed pool as well. Our governor is their little bitch because he was a brewer. Don't drink beer! Do drugs and drink water!
This reminds me of Tesla vs. the American auto industry where big auto is trying to ensure their outdated middle men get a slice of the pie while trying to block sales of rising competitors. Some free market... 
Good luck, Grayton Beer Company.  We've had similar problems with teabagger state governments colluding with Miller/Coors up here in WI, to the detriment of WI's otherwise tremendous craft beer industry.  If you're not one of the big boys, conservatives will stomp all over your face as soon as someone cuts them a check to do so - all the while thumping their chest about their support of the American small-business owner.
I wonder what regulatory red tape they would have to cut through to become their own distributor, through another entity, thereby becoming their own middleman.  I'm sure they already thought of this and it isn't profitable but damn that would be some good justiceporn  to watch unfold.
Check out the Budvar/Czechvar story.
Mmm....nothing tastier than beer made from Florida water.

Mmmm.mmmm.

You can't hardly taste the swamp!
Lousy politics and beer. Fuck-off Budweiser.
Budweiser, is made of shit. That's the real problem.
Oh hellll no. They'd best fuck off with that. Some of these local brews are outstanding. Hell most of them are outstanding.
This is crazy because AB InBev certainly does not compete with craft brewers. Two totally different products, markets, and customers. No one contemplates the choice between bud light and a triple IPA. 
So? They are some foreign conglomerate. Who gives a shit what they think? If they don't like it, let them take their poison elsewhere.
I would gladly eject Florida (as well as Arizona) from the USA any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
Because lawmakers have nothing better to do than spend their time worrying about fair rules of beer distribution....
Craft brews are crap anyway. I refuse to support a business ran by frat boys who borrowed money from their daddy. Miller High Life, that's a real beer. 
My solution would be for the breweries to pull up stakes and move to another state. 

edit:  your downvotes keep me young
Many of the senators are incumbents who will be running unopposed for re-election, meaning the opinion of their constituents is of little concern. "Hm, the people I represent are strongly opposed to this bill, but Budweiser gave me $1000 in campaign financing..."
Must be that free market conservatives love so much!
> they will just bribe our government so they dont have to compete with better companies.

What's so strange about that? I thought this was accepted business practice. (I wish I was being sarcastic.)
> It seems AB InBev is too afraid to compete with craft beer in the market, so instead they would rather pay off politicians and legislate it out of a profitable existence.

No.  They're not "afraid", they've just run the cost-benefit analysis on the effect of spending X number of dollars on lobbyists and campaign donations vs advertising, and lobbyists and donations wins.  

Don't hate the players, hate the game.  You want to stop this type of thing properly, you have to get rid of the mechanism instead of throwing vitriol at those who try to use it.

Reading comprehension fail.

AB InBev has NOTHING to do with this bill, this article, or anything else here.

The group lobbying for the bill is made up of AB InBev DISTRIBUTORS.
The bill that this policy originates from was basically put in effect by Anheuser Busch so that they could bypass the three tier system for their theme park (Busch Gardens) in Tampa. It had nothing to do with growlers specifically, but still applies. It states that containers 32oz and lower and 128oz and higher are permissable, most likely to allow large beers and kegs. The best part is that AB InBev now complains that craft breweries are using the bill to an unfair advantage, when in reality, craft breweries are just using it in the same way Anheuser Busch created it for themselves in the first place.

Anheuser Busch are a bunch of hypocrites.
This is because the distributors are pretty much controlled by big beer. It is in the distributor's best interest to support their big beer accounts over small craft breweries. Beer producers are required to sign exclusive contracts with their distributors, and these contracts are EXTREMELY difficult to get out of, especially because most small breweries would not have the funds necessary for the lawyer fees that would be required.

This is the main reason why the three tier system is a broken mess.
The tiered system of liquor distribution makes no practical sense, but at this point the distributors are so bloated (politicians only see this in terms of jobs) they are almost impossible to dismantle.
Money is speech. Money buys advertising space, prints books, hosts websites, etc. Sorry bro.
If you were a senator, would you know enough about the economics of craft brewing that you'd just want to vote on the bill without meeting with anyone in the industry? A lobbyist is just an industry (or other interest group, but mostly industry) representative that explains how a bill might effect that industry and how they'd like them to vote. Of course it's much more corrupt and complicated than that in the real world. Still, lobbyists serve an important role in politics, though I certainly agree they should be regulated much more heavily.
That's exactly the deal.
Apparently corporations are people too now...
Welcome to America. Get used to it.
Well, Kickstarters regularly get over a million. 

Can't we kick-starter an election contribution to some legislators to get them addicted to Internet money, and threaten to snatch it away from them if they go against our interests? 

Thats seems to be the most direct route to fixing the system as it stands. 
$250 per month for 50 images? So, they wanted to pay a professional photographer $5 per image? Are they fucking stupid? Not even amateurs work for that low of pay! That's burglary!

I hope you laughed in their faces and told your photography buddies to be wary of them.
They use a lot of adjuncts, such as corn and rice so that the beer is cheaper to make. It's one of the reasons they encourage customers to drink beer freezing cold out of a frosted mug. When the beer is that cold you can't taste anything.
Lots of hate. I used to work for them as an engineer and they do own quite a few brands that aren't "crap" as you put it.

The most remarkable thing they've gotten down to a science is keeping their flavors/tastes/etc of all their products identical across the country. That's no small feat. Smaller breweries don't have nearly as much trouble with it due to the amount of barrels they produce. 

They also have done a fantastic job of setting up a distribution network that really has no competition - it's one of the main reasons they were targeted by InBev. 
>Any craft beer/homebrew law has to be cleared by the ABDI (Associated Beer Distributors of Illinois).

That's pretty outrageous.  Is that really the case in Florida?

No wonder the beer available at most retail stores is such shit.

only a free market when it benefits those in control
At least in New England, I'm pretty sure Harpoon is their own distributor 
not true in the least, InBev owns a ton of craft breweries across the nation
Just in case you were being sarcastic: the high life is actually pretty good in my opinion.
That's... not really how it works. Most craft breweries are small start-ups with strong ties to their community. Not to mention that you can't just bring your state issued licenses, which are expensive and hard to get, with you across state lines.
>$1,000

Lol.  They aren't even going to get out of bed for $1,000.

Anheuser-Busch has already donated more than $650,000 to candidates this cycle and spent over $4,000,000 on lobbying.

In 2012, they spent over $2,000,000 in direct contributions alone.

This isn't due to the free market. Under a free market government doesn't have to power to regulate all this, so companies can't get political influence. This is a product if large government involvement in our economic environment 
I love the free markets where politicans regulate and make it illegal to decide what you can and cannot buy.

Its scary that there are people that think anything here is capitalism, this is blatent government intervention.
Conservatives? I think you mean Libertarians. Conservatives are basically Democrats with Jesus, and without unions.
>Don't hate the players, hate the game.

Can we not be against both? Nothing is forcing the "players" to "play" the game here.
An asshole is still an asshole, whether or not he is "playing the game".
The "game" in this case is the players rigging the game.  So I think I'll hate the players.
Fuck you, idiot.
AB InBev has nothing to do with it? I'm sorry, could you please repeat your distinction on the type of distributors they are?
Corporations are not people per se, corporations are [legal fictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction) afforded certain rights that are ordinarily only available to people
in almost every way except accountability.  It might actually be better for them to be considered that way to prosecute. eg illegal dumping in rivers
Corporations are speech.
Unions too.
I politely wrote back and said that wasn't within my range of acceptable pay and that if they had something else with some more pay and less overhead - I'd be down.

It was for an ad agency who was running it for inbev. I wonder if it's a bad idea to post the contract. Some of the shit in there was hilarious. Here's a general idea of what they "wanted" and "didn't want"

AB sells nearly half of the beer brands on the market. You can't judge them by Budweiser alone.

I'm an Alexander Keith's man. They're AB. So is Stella. So are a plethora of others. Attack them for their methods. Attack them for their marketing.

But to attack them for their beer is silly; if there is a beer in a popular market, they'll just buy it. So now they own nearly all of the good beers, except for craft beer they haven't bought yet.
I had a GF that had a wheat gluten intolerance. She could drink guiness and cider for obvious reasons. And bud light, because fucking rice I guess
I agree that it is impressive that they produce such a consistent product, but the tactics they are using to keep control over their market share is disgusting, and I don't like their beer so I'm not a fan.  I work at a craft brewery in NC, and I know a ton of breweries would fail if NC implemented laws like that. 
My family is from MO and my uncle worked for them for over 20 years. What you say is true about their prowess in science and QA/QC. He was a main man in that dept. They used to have every big batch cryo-frozen since the 70's so that they could compare. InBev scrapped the project. 

The problem is that once InBev came in, they started treating everyone like shit and totally decimated the family atmosphere that previously existed. 

Gone were the perks, gone were the old culture (and old timers). They completely corporatized. It's quite amazing that Budweiser was able to be so profitable while sustaining such a pro-workforce culture. This is another reason they were targeted. InBev knew they could come in and make working there suck ass, and in the process increase profit. 

The are now just a huge leach. 

On the positive side, they are no longer the best selling beer brand in St. Louis (anecdotal). That blows my mind.  Budweiser was bigger and more profitable than InBev. Still confused how they were the ones that were bought. Though I know it has something to do with wall street and investors liking InBev's history of killing the good life as an employee. 
>they do own quite a few brands that aren't "crap" as you put it.

Nah, they really don't.

>They also have done a fantastic job of setting up a distribution network that really has no competition

Sure, if by that you mean that they bought enough shills in Congress to set up the three-tier system, which endlessly fucks over small brewers and distributors.
And not a single one of those is worth drinking.
It's my everyday beer. 
He's right to an extent, Florida isn't known for craft beer. States like Oregon, Colorado, Michigan, and California are, because they have business environments and state liquor laws conducive to the enterprise.


You'd be surprised how small some of the donations are. These are STATE legislators we're talking about after all.
Your source immediately contradicts you.

> Contributions to candidates: $325,281

Top candidate got $11,600.  That's Roy Blunt, R-MO.  Only 5 got $10k or more.  The least was Al Franken, $250.

Also a fun fact: 9 members of Congress own shares in AB.

It's honestly shameful the small amount of money that members of Congress are willing to accept in order to push legislation that citizens oppose.  I mean, if you're going to be corrupt and obedient to a corporate master, at least get filthy rich doing it.  I'm talking like so rich you'd be finding sweaty $100s for years in your house.
Thats the joke.

Unless this guy is really really dumb. I still upvoted him because it mocks the fact that people think we are a 'free market'.
The only 'player' in this stupid little game is InBev.

Fuck those guys and their shit beer.

These are the same guys that gobbled up Goose Island Brewery in Chicago then moved the production of 312 Urban Wheat to upstate NY.  312 is Chicago's area code....and it is brewed hundreds of miles away now.  
'cept if you don't you will be broke and a fool.
> Nothing is forcing the "players" to "play" the game here.

You're not really familiar with a corporation's officers and their legal duty to maximize income and profitability on behalf of their shareholders who appoint them, are you?
Right on. As I understand it SABMiller is not supporting the lobbying effort
No, the "game" is allowing lobbying and political donations from corporations.  That is what needs fixing.

There's no "rigging" here at all, just one side has more money than the other.  Maybe all the craft breweries in the state should get together and form a PAC, then target the most vulnerable of the purchased politicians and spend enough to ensure he/she loses next cycle as a lesson to the rest.  That would also be playing the game.
Noo..  fuck YOU.  Your system is broken and when people try and point that out you get all bitchy.  Fix your system.
**ARTICLE:** You know what? I hate my Mercedes Benz dealership! What an asshole company! Did you know that two of their dealerships in my town are lobbying for the city council to make the ass-fucking of sheep legal?

**YOUR SUMMARY:** Mercedes Benz wants to make ass-fucking of sheep legal!

Distributors are legally separate entities from the brewer, and legally CANNOT have any common overlaps (IE, if you own a distributor, you aren't allowed to be on the board of AB InBev, etc).

As I said before, reading comprehension fail. You don't know the difference between the DISTRIBUTOR and the BREWER.

AB InBev has NOTHING to do with the lobbying to get this bill passed. This is about protecting the revenue stream of the [3 tier alcohol distribution system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_\(alcohol_distribution\)), which you really need to learn about before you make any more of a fool of yourself than you already have.

I am hardly a professional photographer but what exactly is bad on this page? 


Also this seems more like "street team" work for hobbiests recent grads than a profressional assignments. 

Craft breweries use fish bladders, algae, mold and dirt in various parts of the brewing process. What's your point?
The original comment is aimed at Budweiser specifically. I stand by my statement.
AB InBev doesn't own anywhere near half the brands on the market. Wikipedia says they own about 200 brands. There are around 3,000 breweries in the US alone.

Maybe you meant sales volume? Yes, they have about 47% of sales in the US, and around 25% worldwide.
>So now they own nearly all of the good beers

Like . . . uh . . . Keith's and Stella?
Guinness has lots of gluten proteins in it, but whatever


> they are no longer the best selling beer brand in St. Louis (anecdotal).

They still are, but Schlafly is slowing eating it's way into the market.
I genuinely enjoy Landshark over Corona and have liked ShockTop as well. Hoegaarden is pretty tasty too. I don't think any of those are 'crap'. 
> Nah, they really don't.

Goose Island isn't crap...

There's a reason it's #2 on this list: http://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/
And you know from experiencing every one?

Most of those beer were bought up by AB or InBev years ago based on their merits, and weren't invented as some shitty popular American easily accessible beer like Bud Light.

I've been a Keith's drinker since I started drinking over a decade ago, and haven't found a single beer I like more. And I've tried a fuckton of beer.
Beer hipsters are the worst hipsters.
you've had every single thing from this list? 
I kinda like Spaten... :(
And your tastes are completely different than others. Also, their bank accounts would seem to disagree with you. 
It seems there are not many fans of it here.
Right and the cmpetitive market there is much tighter. States where it's just starting is a lot easier to get into.
I would wager that you could get a state rep to stop by your place and pick up a $1000 check, up it to $2500 and you could prob get a sitting congressman. 
Maybe they honestly believe they're doing the right thing, and AB is just donating to people who it agrees with. Like you said, what kind of idiots sell their votes for pennies?

I'm not saying that's the case, but not every business donation to a politician is a bribe.
I thought he was serious..but really I see wayy too many posts of people thinking we have an overreaching free market when it's just the opposite. 

AB InBev wouldn't be able to play without their stooges in congress. They wouldn't be able to get away with it if they were the only ones profiting.
Same kind of thing happened to Weinhard's, they had been a Portland centerpiece since the 1800s, got bought up by SAB Miller.

Fuck you, Schludwiller.
The only player? Really? I'm pretty sure every large company ever tries to get political influence. Which is why the government needs to have less power to dish out. 
Only if your product fucking sucks. Otherwise, the market really does a pretty swell job of picking winners and losers.
While almost all states' common law would recognize a duty to shareholders (simplistically), there is huge flexibility in how that duty is carried out.  No court in any state in the United States would ever hold that an officer breaches their duties when they refuse to engage in lobbying.  Businesses have almost complete freedom to decide what the best way run their business is (the so-called "business judgment rule").

The board is free to replace officers they feel aren't being aggressive enough and the shareholders are free to replace board members they feel aren't running the company with an eye to sufficient profit, but the law wouldn't become involved in this fact scenario.

edit*: Just point out, shareholders don't appoint officers.  They appoint board members.
There is no law compelling a corporation to make any profit. The drive comes from board members utilizing quackpot Friedman theories for short term gains. 

This is not a law, but an understanding of a concept put forth by the architect of our current fucked-up economic situation: Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics.  
You say that as if it's inevitable, when in reality, a corporation is a legal entity subject to specific requirements under the law, which can be changed.
This is correct, they supported 64oz growlers without stipulations.
They'd do it if they weren't allowed.  The way you bribe a politician today isn't giving him money in a suitcase, it's hooking up all his friends and relatives.

All the brewers in the state couldn't afford more than InBev.  They're fucking gigantic, they have revenue greater than a lot of countries.
Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's right and reasonable and soulles pro-corporate sociopaths like you should be stood up and shot fucking dead.
And corporations protect their self interest, owners who are also PEOPLE.  See we can both write in caps.  
Unions self interest is money.

They contacted me looking for a lifestyle photographer. I just thought it was funny that the American flag couldn't be involved, specifically. Not only that, but they wanted photos from EACH of the 4 styles. (Concerts, sporting events, happy hours, outdoors) So that's a lot of overhead to shoot for anyone, not only that, buying 2x budweisers & 2x bud lights per event (with absolutely zero reimbursement for tickets to anything, beers at happy hours, etc)

Having them on a portfolio is neat and all, but no.

Looks like they're looking for bud light fans to snap photos with their cell phones, which is perfectly fine, but don't expect me to do all this shit for $250.

Very well.
I was just spit balling there and deserve the downvotes.

I think that if I enumerated all of the beers in my local store, half would be AB owned. I also was aware that their sales were nearly half, which is probably why I said that.

If you add up all of the locally made and sold brews everywhere, I'm sure it would dwarf AB, but definitely not in sales.
Well, there are more in there that are good too.

But I won't deny there's a crap ton of bad beer as well.

I guess I was probably over stating how many of the world's good beers they have. There is a ton of independent great craft beer out there.
True. My lady friend was apparently only intolerant to wheat gluten specifically. I was somewhat incredulous about it but then again Jewish people tend to have some crazy specific genetic/protein interactions.  Even though the barley used for Guinness is a grain it's not wheat so I guess it worked for her. Also beer is tasty
>Goose Island isn't crap...

Goose Island is *a* brand, not "quite a few brands."
I've tried many but not all of those. From the ones that I have tried, I would extrapolate that the others are also of low quality.

It is true that AB InBev will buy up popular craft beers, and clone the ones that won't sell under one of their "secret" brands (the ones that they don't want people to know are theirs), but I've never had any one that stands up to an honest to goodness craft beer.
answered already below. I've had many but not all of them, and I feel safe extrapolating from my experience with the many that I have tried.
Sure, it's subjective as all hell. But I still think it's shitty that they're trying to legislate superior products out of existence instead of competing on product quality. 

Also, I don't see the fact that their beverages are popular as being indicative of high quality. Justin Bieber is extremely popular, too.
This would be investigative journalism done right. 
Its scary how many people think Comcast/ATT monopolies are part of the free market. Or how the cost of health care is a result of capitalism when the AMA, APA, AHA, BCBS, and CVS are some of the top lobbyiests in the nation. 
Actually, most states' common law (and a few written laws) would include a duty for board members to act in the best interest of shareholders (simplistically).  This typically means making money.  Still, board members have almost complete leeway in deciding how to serve the shareholders.  The typical resolution of a situation where the board isn't acting in the shareholders interest is to replace board members.  Nevertheless, lawsuits against a board that isn't acting in the shareholders' interests do occur (A good example would be when Apple didn't have a dividend--shareholders sued).
That's what I'm saying.  Change the law if you want actual change.  For every corporation a boycott campaign shames into compliance, there will be 1000 others doing the same damn thing.  Altering the law that currently allows this to happen is the only way to stop them all.  Anything else is just feeling good while pissing on a forest fire.
> The way you bribe a politician today isn't giving him money in a suitcase

No, it's donations to their election campaign.

>All the brewers in the state couldn't afford more than InBev.

Sure they could.  InBev is an international corporation but even they aren't going to foot hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for each of those senators.  Whereas by comparison, the brewers only have to unseat one.  And they don't even have to let anyone know what happened until after the election cycle and all the donations are part of the public record, which wouldn't even give InBev the chance to try and defend any of "their guys"

InBev is spending a bit of cash in a local market to see what they can get in return.  The minute it starts being a war of attrition and looks to cost *real* money is the minute InBev is going to decide their lobbying cash is better spent elsewhere.
Are you really calling someone else a sociopath right now?
Everyone's self interest is money.

> I think that if I enumerated all of the beers in my local store, half would be AB owned.

That sounds like a really sad selection.

There are only about 16 brands [on this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_InBev_brands) that I can say I've seen in the US:

> Bass, Beck's, Boddington's, Budweiser, Busch, Franziskaner, Goose Island, Labatt, Leffe, Michelob, Natural Light, Rolling Rock, Shock Top, Spaten, St Pauli Girl, Stella Artois

(Not counting things like Bud and Bud Light as different, or the Franziskaner varieties, etc... just the brands.)

Meanwhile, brands that I know I can find in just one of my local stores (the one with the smaller selection):

> Brooklyn Brewing, Abita, Stone, Rogue, Terrapin, Avery, Sam Adams, Flying Fish, Dogfish Head, Prism, Ommegang, Port Brewing, Bolero Snort, Carton, Kane, 21st Amendment, DC Brau, Maine Beer, Clown Shoes, Firestone Walker, Summit, Schlafly, New Holland, Left Hand, Sixpoint, Avery, Troegs, Weyerbacher, Slumbrew, Allagash, Ballast Point, Founders, Epic, Lost Abbey, River Horse, Oskar Blues, Great Divide, DuClaw, Manayunk, Speakeasy, Widmer Brothers, Victory, Unita, Fegley's, Magic Hat

That's 45 brands. And I'm sure there's a bunch I'm missing. Especially since I deliberately left out imports - Orval, Westmalle, Chimay, Het Anker, Weihenstphaner, St. Bernardus, Chouffe, Kasteel, Val-Dieu, BrewDog, Rochefort -- that's 56 now.
>Well, there are more in there that are good too.

I don't think there is, though. The only brewery AB-Inbev owns which is making really good beer is Goose Island, largely because all they did when they bought them was throw lots of money at them and take over production of their commodity beers. Their portfolio of brands exists mostly to sell beers which amount to region-specific versions of Budweiser and Bud Light.
This list doesn't' mention Goose Island, a craft brewery from Chicago that AB InBev bought.

Goose Island is an excellent beer--try 312 (after the Chicago area code)
certainly not the majority, but a good fair number of these beers are rated "above average". i think you meant to say, "i didn't like many of these beers" not "these aren't worth drinking".
Trust me, their process is very high quality and I noted elsewhere they go to great lengths to ensure that level of quality. 

The tasting every day they talk about on commercials? Absolutely happens. 
Their QA department is also pretty awesome - they even have a custom built machine to measure the torque required to removed their bottle caps. 

The product itself is like any other mass produced beer. They use hop pellets, and do legitimately ship them from overseas if called for in their recipe. The yeast used for the traditional Budweiser is sent to each of their breweries from the 'master' culture in St. Louis every week or month (been a few years since I worked there). 

You may not care for the taste yourself, but it isn't really low quality. 

I'm a huge IPA fan and do love micro and nano brews, so don't get the impression all I drink is Bud :-). I think my favorites are Bells Two-Hearted mixed with Guinness (Black Hearted) and some Dogfish Head Burton Baton. Hardywood isn't too far from me and they have some good brews, and Troeggs MadElf is one of my fav seasonals. 
it could could be done for half the cost during campaign season. Who wants to sponsor my new investigatory series? It will be called "The cost of democracy" and I'll just pay candidates 500 bucks to talk about FEC reform on camera. Now somebody tell me that wouldn't be good enough for netflix at least?
There is a time when the government does need to step in and break up monopolies, but that is no excuse for the massive government regulatory agencies impeding our economy.

 And please explain how CVS is raising the cost of health care. The reality is government loan programs and guarantees are reducing the free market aspect of health care and have a universal increase in the price of medical care. Almost identical to the way the government student loans have skyrockted the price of tuition. 

At the end of the day, the free market REDUCES prices, because when something is profitable more people will offer the product, creating competition. Nothing the government can do will lower prices and give a better product.
The difference between operating in the best interests of shareholders, and operating to maximize profit is immense. First, operating in best interests of shareholders allows the board to disagree with shareholders to an extent. So long as the company is functioning well, legally, and successfully, the best interests would be met upon the view of a reasonable person. Maximizing profit is an ambiguous statement that holds no value. What would be maximizing? Secondly, could maximizing profit cause harm to the corporation and the shareholders? Thusly, the statement that maximizing profit  for shareholders being the legal requirement of a corporation's leadership is false. Profit is a result of a successful business, not the sole purpose. Short term profit chasing is a result of shareholder's being given power over the direction of the corporations, and relatively recent concept. Ultimately this whole discussion is not really a legal concept, but a sort of reality that board members act upon in self preservation. 
No, that was like 3 hours ago, idiot.
So corporation money = bad

union money = good
> The only brewery AB-Inbev owns which is making really good beer is Goose Island, largely because all they did when they bought them was throw lots of money at them and take over production of their commodity beers.

After drinking the Coffee BCBS, I'll say: Whatever they're doing, they should keep doing it.
I have had Goose Island's brews. Their regular stuff is rather unremarkable, but their small batch limited releases are usually spot on.
Yeah, I get that consistency is really hard to do when brewing beer, so any company that manages to make all their batches taste the same is doing something *right*, but I don't think that necessarily means that they're doing something *good*. Again, taste is subjective as hell, but I've had good lagers before, and I don't think any of them were AB InBev owned.

I don't think this discussion is going to change anyone's viewpoint though. I will admit that they are a big and successful company with very consistent products across the board. But I don't like any of those products, and until I accidentally try one that I do, my perception of their products is unlikely to change.
>CVS is raising the cost of health care.

You want to buy a perscription? Only a few companies can legally own them. 

>There is a time when the government does need to step in and break up monopolies

I would like to know of a time that the free market made a monopoly. Every monopoly Ive ever read about was created by laws.
Most (possibly all, I am unsure without researching) states do not use a reasonable person test.  The type of duty owed by directors (and officers) is a fiduciary duty and goes well beyond what a "reasonable person" would consider sufficient.  There is a legal duty, long recognized in common law, that companies must be run to provide the best return to the shareholders (which means profit and not some other measure, barring language in the companies founding documents and an enabling state law) .  The reason I qualified my description using "simplistically" is because the reality is much more complex (and probably varies depending upon the state).  

You commit the fallacy of fallacies.  Just because a term is ambiguous does not mean that the the conclusion is false.  Maximizing profit (not typically termed this, but works for a simplistic discussion) is well understood and, yes, there is a legal duty for directors to run their company to maximize return.

The qualifier on this, which is a caveat from duty, is that the directors are allowed to use their best business judgment (the idea being that it has to benefit the BUSINESS and hence the shareholders) in accomplishing their duty.  Almost anything can be justified using this reasoning.  For example: donating to charity (which is justified as increasing customer appreciation of the company--donating just to donate would likely violate fiduciary duties of directors).  While you suggest that directors don't think in these terms, I assure you the corporate attorneys who advise the boards of large corporations do. 
Alright, that wasn't the point but you're right on that.
Well that's probably because you don't live in Chicago and didn't have it when they were actually a small craft brewery, which they are clearly no longer (they are mass market).

Back in the day in Chicago their beers were amazing, even the ones that are mass produced now at scale like 312 or their pale ales.


I agree, don't think many people will stumble on it and go out and buy a Bud but I won't be upset. 

Out of curiosity, have you tried any of their Michelob Craft stuff? Or the Budweiser (Brewmaster Series) spin-offs? Some of those aren't bad at all. 
I think we agree on things quite a bit. How did the Comcast/ATT merge happen? 
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/09/how-the-cult-of-shareholder-value-wrecked-american-business/
Nah, they really weren't. 312 was better than it used to be, but it was always a pretty mediocre beer. People in Chicago just thought it was great because it was endemic to Chicago, the same was people in Wisconsin think Spotted Cow is great just because it's endemic to Wisconsin. Their regular lineup was generally okay, but "unremarkable" sounds about right to me.
No, I haven't run into those (didn't know they existed).
I think this list of the top lobbyists speak for itself:

These are the top lobbyiests:

>US Chamber of Commerce $74,470,000 

>National Assn of Realtors $38,584,580 

>Blue Cross/Blue Shield $22,510,280 

>Northrop Grumman $20,590,000 

>National Cable & Telecommunications Assn $19,870,000 

>American Hospital Assn  $19,143,813 

>**Comcast Corp $18,810,000**

>American Medical Assn $18,160,000 

>Pharmaceutical Rsrch & Mfrs of America $17,882,500 

>General Electric $16,130,000 

>**AT&T Inc $15,935,000**

First of all, we seem to be coming at this from two different angles.  I'm not arguing the business actuality but the legal reality.  I'm responding to the idea that there are no legal duties owed by directors and officers.

As for the article, it is incorrect.  It states "Nor does the law require, as many believe, that executives and directors owe a special fiduciary duty to shareholders. The fiduciary duty, in fact, is owed simply to the corporation, which is owned by no one, just as you and I are owned by no one — we are all “persons” in the eyes of the law".  In fact, shareholders do "own" the  corporation, hence why we talk of equity interests--it is not a "contractual claim".  While a corporation is a legal "person", this is a term of art and not one you can magically infer cannot be owned (that part kinda bugs me, this journalist should know better than that).

It is correct that the duty is owed to the corporation, but the shareholders are who we really mean (legally speaking).  I said earlier I was using a simplistic way of referring to this situation and this is why (I don't mean this to sound condescending, it's just really complicated and takes a lot of history to understand).  Sadly, this journalist does not understand business law very well.  Moreover, its fairly clear, by the tone, that he has an agenda of reform.  I'm not debating that reform would be nice, but this isn't how the legal world works currently and he misstates what the law actually is (moreover, it varies by state).
If you see them grab a pack, I think both are available in 12pk of bottles with either 3 x 4 of a kind or 4 x 3 of a kind so you get a variety pack. 

And I don't mean the Mich Ultra Cactus one haha. I'll try to find them on Beer Advocate - hadnt thought to look them up. 
As someone who loves making beer this is fucking horseshit. 


Well, S. Africa just solved its economic impasse. 
At least Belgium might be happy and stfu for a bit...
Expect much more of this in the near future. Not just from Inbev.
[deleted]
What's AB-InBev?
Hurt your wallet a bit, but genuinely help a massive amount of people. Or maybe I'm just biased bc I hate IPAs.
Agreed
World's largest beer brewer. Owns budweiser, corona, beck's, devil's backbone, and rolling rock to list a few

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch_InBev
I'm an IPA fan but since I've started homebrewing I've really branched out. Hooked on Saisons and Cream ales currently. 
Ah, I know that company, they suck many of the 'dicks'.  Like how they keep printing latrobe on Rolling Rock despite IMMEDIATELY closing down the factory on acquisition.  Or how Bud was the worst beer in the world, but the owner married the daughter of a man who had the best shipping network in the US.  Thank you :)
Try sours. They are a lot of fun, but require some extra equipment and patience.  

Another thing I got hooked on after picking up the hobby is fruit beers...particularly raspberry and black raspberry hefeweizens.  I have a big garden, so it is natural that I use my own raspberries...but the nice thing about brewing it myself is that I can ferment out the excess sweetness that is present in commercial fruit beers, and actually get a fruit beer that still tastes like beer.  
Damn that communist China tho. 
AB upset that people don't like their shitty beer and want alternatives? Sounds like corporate butthurt.
I won't drink their products so then doing this just makes me go dry not like they'll be gaining any new customers. I'll just switch back to scotch.
When your product can't compete, your legal and financial departments can!
They did that in Brazil! Over there 99% of the bars only sell one beer on draft. If you try to have other beers, not only will they not sell that beer, they will stop selling you all the beers they own. Oh and they hold the Pepsi co. contract over there too, so you lose that too.

Sorry, AB. If I wanted your beer, I wouldn't pay 2x to drink better better. 
Being in the industry(bartender) in Texas, I have seen a major shift beer sales. Four years ago, almost every beer ordered would be a product of either Miller or A.B. Nowadays, everyone wants something local. Those shitty macro brewery beers now collect dust and the only chance one will be ordered is if some old red neck wants his shitty light beer. The industry has changed, and honestly for the better.
But-why? Hurr hurr hurr
So...a shitty company that sells shitty beer does something shitty. I can't say I'm surprised by Adolf B.
They own a ton of those "craft" breweries anyways, so what gives?
They own a lot of craft breweries, so you probably do drink their stuff.
American who works on Brazil. Where the fuck is my Bohemia 
Boulder creek , Samuel smiths and Guinness. not much past that parts my lips.
Well then look for AB InBev to purchase them 
Boulder creek they might sell the other 2 will tell them where to stick it.
There is a lot of money in cheap beer!
Time for a refreshing Millweiser Lite.
There sure is. According the article this new merger is going to account for 50% of the industry's profits.
And I thought Taco Bell would win The Franchise Wars
For those that didn't read the article, Inbev will be selling Miller to Coors as well as getting rid of some other brands, like Peroni and Pilsner Urquell, to meet anti-trust requirements in the US and around the world.  China is the last to need approval but Inbev has agreed to sell their stake in Snow, the top selling beer in the world.  They also made some minor concessions to the US regarding purchasing more craft beer brands and some business tactics to keep control of taps.  I am not sure if the MillerCoors-Molson Coors merger will require approval or what other changes might be coming as a result.
Pretty sure this is one of the final signs of the apocalypse.
They should just make one beer called "Cheap American Beer"  It will be made by combining the recipes for Bud, Miller, and Coors.
