They do sell only reusable plastic bottles in Finland. Iirc it is mandated by law that your bottle must be reusable and that there’s a deposit in it.

It isn't like I've been offered any alternatives in any serious way
Coca-Cola had resealable glass bottles in the U.S. in the 80's...
So, yeah, they could do it again, but it would cut their sugar water profits...
I would greatly prefer glass bottles. Not only are they recyclable, but I firmly stand by the opinion that the coke in glass bottles tastes better than the coke in cans and plastic bottles.

Edit: And the glass bottles with the screw on caps are not only recyclable, but also reusable.
Yeah, well at least you get Coke made with real sugar, U.K.
Bulltwinkies.  Consumers will buy what coke delivers. Coke likes the current profit model.
Why don't they package Coca-Cola in bioplastics? It's a win-win really, since consumers won't notice a difference but they're environmentally-friendly.
surcharge the externality of collection and proper disposal. the consumer can pay for that...
I work for Coca-Cola.  

Our products come in many different packages.  For instance, at a gas station you can buy 12 packs which are in aluminum cans, 2-liters in plastic, the single serve coolers have PET bottles as well as glass and aluminum.  The PET products sell at an overwhelmingly higher rate than single serve aluminum products.  You can buy a 20oz bottle for $1.89 or look at the top (in most cases) and get a 16oz aluminum can for $.99.  Simple math shows that the can is a better value yet 99% of consumers in NA grab the plastic product.

EDIT:  My 99% is an estimate in my own market.  It could be 96% or 90%.  I just know that single use PET bottles outsell glass by a massive margin.

I know for a fact our facility works as hard as possible to help the environment.  We’ve ran hybrid trucks, detuned vehicles for mileage, lowered speed limits for best economy, and other fleet management changes which leave a smaller carbon footprint for our distribution.  We have recycling posts outside most major stores and gas stations which people fill with trash instead of recyclables.  We buy back our expired or damaged products and haul back for recycling.  We’ve also changed Dasani bottles to mostly plant based bioplastics.  Why this isn’t done for the carbonated beverages I’m not sure.  I also heard that we may be testing canned water instead of PET products.

Within the last few years Coca-Cola North America sold off most distribution and bottling to independent companies.  I’m not even sure how many there are in North America now.  I’m not sure how regulations imposed on CCNA would impact independent facilities in different states.

As far as the PET products go, we use blow molds to make our bottles on site.  We do not buy full-size bottles and ship them.  A 20oz bottle is slightly larger than the cap itself before its blown.   When seeing this process in action I often wonder how much energy is created.  The room gets to over 100 degrees and is so loud you need hearing protection just to enter.  It’s a cool process to watch!

In the end, we produce what people buy.  If people stopped buying PET products for aluminum or glass products the bottlers would rapidly change which package types are sold to the stores.

I hope that helps.  I’m newer to Reddit.  Don’t downvote me please!  I’ll answer any questions that people may have that I know the answer to.  I just hate seeing articles about our company that suggests we don’t give a shit about our planet.  As a company, we don’t throw the bottles in the landfills or oceans.  We need changes by the consumer to dictate our future.
If you want to get them to change then stop buying/drinking coke.
Yep, just shows that companies care about sustainability only up to the point where it affects their profits materially.
Their job as a company is to sell a product to consumers.

If you stop buying single use bottles, they will stop producing them.
Plastic bottles makes every single soda taste weird
The solution is clear, stop drinking soda and enjoy some clean crisp H2O. Its better for you, doesn't require single use packaging, costs almost nothing, and has little to no carbon footprint associated with shipping (if you drink tap water).
I'd rather glass bottles. Although glass bottles are heavier, so in terms of going green, glass adds weight, burns more gas for travel.
another reason I’ll keep not drinking coke
I usually just recycle my plastic bottles. Isn't that what most people do?
The taste from aluminum cans is SO much better than plastic
But Cola from a plastic bottle tastes awful. Cola from a glass bottle tastes amazing.
[removed]
Life Coke addict here, give me glass please
Consumers want them because ya'll aren't offering fucking anything else. Whenever I go to my spanish store for food, I always grab the glass bottle. Costs me a few cents more but I don't care. Tastes better and I know that its way easier to recycle.

What a bunch of idiots.
If you shape the fate of the planet based on market demand you're gonna have a bad time.
Coca-cola the same company that thinks there is no future in pot...

Yea how old are your executives and board?
I’ll bet you can use the bottles to bail water out of your newly-flooded basements, so...there’s a second use right there.  And after *that* fails, a third use can be strapping a bunch of them together to form a crude (yet totally non-biodegradable!) raft to ferry you on to a better (and hopefully a wee bit drier) life.  And that’s just off the top of my head!  Surely, any actual engineer worth their salt(water) could come up with a fourth, or even a fifth use!   I sense innovation after (glug glug) innovation.  Yippee...what progress!  (Seriously...what progress?)
I'm not letting coke off the hook here but the sole reason my local university couldn't go through with single use plastic ban on campus because Pepsi threatened ligation of breach of contract with the school.
I prefer it in glass or aluminium.
PET is totally recyclable - I make sure 100%  of my bottles go to a recycler - but most people don't do that so we have a behavior problem more than a material problem.
All the smart people can't figure out that we really DON'T want them, they just haven't provided a decent alternative.
Make Glass Bottles Returnable like Mexico.

Thanks.
There's a plastic lining just like the plastic bottles on the inside of the cans too.
In this day and time with all the talk about climate change and environment, why do you all want single use bottles?  I don't get it.
I would prefer glass bottles actually, there's just something that feels classier about drinking diabetes water out of glass.
What we want is glass bottles.
>" Customers like them because they reseal and are lightweight, said Bea Perez."

Don't try to tell me that the massive corporation that is Coca Cola couldn't do some research and development to create a lighter and/or resealable glass bottle. Heck, resealable glass bottles [already exist](https://shop12456.hstatic.dk/upload_dir/shop/laboratory-equipment/drifton-glassco-reagent-bottle-screw-cap-500ml_274-202-04.w610.h610.fill.jpg) and there's already [work being done on lighter glass bottles](https://www.vetropack.com/en/glass-packaging/lightweight-glass/).   


>"She also said using only aluminium and glass packaging could push up the firm's carbon footprint."

...they do understand that it takes energy to recycle and create new bottles each time, right??  


> "So as we change our bottling infrastructure, move into recycling and innovate, we also have to show the consumer what the opportunities are. They will change with us." 

They even say **right here** that if they show the customers what opportunities exist, that they'll change.
A bit misleading on cokes end. What they mean to say is that no one will want to pay the increased price hike that they estimate it will cost them to bottle their more popular sizes. I imagine they've run tons of economic models to figure their losses on this. It will be up to government entities to force private companies to do so.
I'd rather have glass myself
>Customers like them because they reseal and are lightweight, said Bea Perez.

Do you know what else reseals and is lightweight? The tall cans with lids that Monster comes in. Or the little cans with caps that they're about to sell Dasani in.

So make them out of hemp, problem solved.
Why would anyone want something that eventually will increase their chances of developing chronic diseases?
I am usually not regressive in nature but we have billions of tons of usable sand, glass is recyclable, there is no outgassing concerns, and it tastes superior to aluminum and plastic containers.
No shit people still want them. They know that if anything else is used, the increased cost will be passed on down to them and would rather not have to pay double so the CEO can still afford a different Lamborghini for every hour of the day.
"We really want to, you just don't want us to!" -Coke

I reuse half-liter coca-cola bottles by refilling them with Kroger diet cherry cola. They are a better size for long distance driving than the 2 liter Kroger bottles.
My company make a ton of parts for coca cola. If they said no to plastic it would drive our company to a huge loss. These machines run 24/7 constantly making plastic caps and nozzles for the fountain drink syrup bags.
Is recycling aluminum cans cost effective?  I drink seltzer from aluminum cans and one of my friends says that it's useless to save them up for recycling because it costs companies too much to use recycled aluminum so it ends up being thrown away anyway.
No. I def don’t want them.
It is also the most profitable segment of their industry.  Go figure.
Doh!!! Anything for profit, I guess. I doubt consumers still want them... that's likely made up.
It’s ok. I drink water anyways. I use a reusable water bottle that I’ve had for 2 years
it doesn't taste the same in plastic bottles for whatever reason.  cans, glass, or fountain is best, IMO.
I don't want them, they just don't give me another choice if I want a soda.
According to the Coca Cola website, their products are consumed at the rate of more than 1.9 billion drinks per day. Fountain drinks aside, what are the alternatives to the single use containers? By single use I mean glass, aluminum and plastic. I know of no other container in which to buy their products. Are their plastics under development perhaps that are more easily biodegradable? If there is a viable solution available, I don't see a problem phasing out the current packaging options.
I like the glass bottles but I’m near the border so I get the Mexican made coke and it’s made with sugar and tastes way the fuck better.
Glass for me, mexican coca cola for me.
To be honest, I’ve always found the Coke that comes in the glass bottle to be far superior to its plastic and aluminum siblings.
They want cheap products. If you didn't need to get a 100 billion dollar net increase every year you could do non-plastic easily.

Suck on a tailpipe.
In South Korea, you would see milk crates full of empty bottles next to every eatery. Stacks of em. Someone told me they get sent back to the factory and they just wash and reuse them. No clue if that was true or not, but seemed smart.

Note: Korea is not the US, it doesn't have to go far to get to a bottling plant.
Coke in plastic bottles is gross anyway, cans or glass ftw
I only buy bottle or can and take them to the recycling place and get my deposit back. We also collect recyclables we see.
We’re going to need to invent a microwave that removes microplastics sooner than later before we find out what health damages they cause.
I mean this is where you just have state and local governments MAKE them do it if they want to sell soda in their state . or if the feds weren't bought and paid for you could have them do it
There is no possible way they will ever phased out
Fine. 

Put a deposit on them.

It used to work perfectly.
I don't know why they don't do those aluminum shaped bottles like they tried for a bit. You could seal them and recycle them.
Head of ~~Sustainability~~ Greenwashing
Start a twitter campaign... "Coca-Cola Company hates the planet!"
who the fuck wants plastic bottles?
I know it has zero impact but I've stopped buying Coke products specifically because of this.
I prefer glass bottles.  Always have, always will.  Drinking out of plastic doesn't taste as good.
that's why bought a hydro flask

fuck these corporations

do whatever you can to spite them!
There they go doing a Bethesda.
Coke lady is an expert koolAid drinker. Figures.
They will of course say anything they want to serve any agenda, they are a corporation why would anyone take them at face value?
I'm pretty sure people want bio degradable bottles.
Most grocery stores have to pay an employee to go out and collect shopping carts.Aldi's charges a quarter to rent a shopping cart.Customers return their carts to get their quarters back. There are never any carts left in the lot. If there are someone else will return it for the quarter.This same model could be used on almost any recyclable.Have recycle center where you bring clean, sorted recyclables and get actual cash for them. In return they are in a condition that can be used without the extra step of washing and sorting and throwing out what isn't recyclable.
Prefer the old glass bottles. What say you?
Canned coke tastes better.
I drink water. And beer.
A major Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet) investment. Where does he stand in the environment?
Bad news delivered by a devil in a red dress almost makes it tolerable.
So, let's force those demanding plastic bottles to pay the actual costs, including a cost against collecting,  recycling, etc.. Coke won't be so quick to dismiss arguments against plastic when their bottom line is dented by the carbon tax and reduced sales due to buyer boycotts and price resistance.
I see the head of sustainability at Coca-Cola as a pretty soul crushing job.
Actually we want glass bottles and real sugar. Sad that today a real coke is called “Mexican coke”
Thats just how it is, you want em to change, dont buy em.
Stop buying this shit product!
Soo, unless we as consumers stop the usage ourselves and not blame the top(i know theyre scum with massive human rights abuses aswell enviromentally destructive) they wont change their ways. Weird. Almost like they are ok wih raking in billions.
I would be fine with the good old glass bottles, even if single use. They can be recycled with the best efficiency. But don't make them triple the price.
Itt: people thinking they are smarter than million dollars worth of market research.
Cardboard bottles. SOLVED.
I rarely drink pop but when I do I get cans. Usually only use pop as mix and bottles go flat too quickly! I really don't know what the alternative for pop bottles is though in their defence. The consumer definitely wants them and what do you replace it with?
In the beginning pop companies where on the hook for recycling their product, so  they passed it on to the customer with a deposit fee. These companies need to be accountable for their products and stop using plastic. Bring back the good old days of glass bottles and kane sugar delicious pop!
My friend orders coke zero syrup and uses his sodastream to make coke zero at home to minimize waste.  But I'm pretty sure it's more expensive to do it that way.
I stopped buying the plastic bottles in favor of cans because cans are easier to recycle. Most of the time the soda would be flat if I didn’t finish it within an hour anyway so it isn’t like closing the lid did anything. I don’t think there are many situations where the bottles are better than cans.
I emailed the company with notification that I'm boycotting all their products till they ditch the plastics.
Coca Cola Inc is absolute evil. They are destroying the health of billions of people in poorer countries  where the average citizen is uneducated about the dangers of sugar. Coca Cola executives actively exploit this to maximise their sales. They are scum.
Where I'm from both Coke and Pepsi also used to ship most of their pop in returnable plastic trays. Now only big bottles are shipped that way, and just some of the small bottles. Everything else is shipped wrapped in thick disposable plastic wrap. I'm not sure why they mostly stopped using the reusable trays but that's even more waste and not recyclable.
What must it be like to be head of sustainability at Coke? "Yeah, we're gonna use as much water as possible, pump out fucktons of plastic bottles, use gazillions of acres of corn, but hey we put a recycling symbol on our bottles and switched Dasani over to thinner plastic."
Boo classic glass bottles back so I can throw them at kids just like the good ol days
Found this link interesting:  [https://earth911.com/living-well-being/recycled-beverage-containers/](https://earth911.com/living-well-being/recycled-beverage-containers/)
In the 70s, and prior, coke was sold in glass bottles, single or 8 pack, that you paid 5c apiece deposit.  You'd return the bottles to the store and get your money back.  There were also quart bottles that were 15c.  Some older vending machines sold the small glass bottles of pop.  Newer vending machines sold cans.  Because bottles were worth money, you'd almost never see them lying around.  And if you did see them lying around, it was not for long, since kids (like myself) were always on the lookout for them, to get money here and there.

I'm 51 and can remember when most things were not plastic. The tube of toothpaste I just used would have been metal a couple of decades ago.  Soap I used in the shower would have been a bar wrapped in paper, not a plastic pump bottle.  I could go on. 

It's not like we can't live without plastic.  In the future, we'll have to limit its use to science and medicine, and we'll be fine.
People were perfectly happy when the cola companies used glass bottles. They changed to plastic because plastic was cheaper to produce and the companies did not have to purchase used bottles back.

So far as being resealable, they could use aluminum bottles which are resealable and highly recyclable.
stop drinking products in plastic bottles.  It's pretty easy to avoid once you start.
I wish for both the sake of the planet and for the betterment of quality, that they would switch back to glass.
I'd rather have aluminum bottles, just saying.
How are companies dealing with single use bans in certain countries??

Canada’s nan kicks in next year and was wondering what Coke’s plan was?
The 'ol "customers still want them excuse"

Bullshit

Spend your billions of salty fizzy sugar water money on a better sustainable design and people will buy it.
Its the truth. Western counties are not going to accept anything that makes any part of their lives harder. And that's the main issue with climate change. The people who can make a change, don't *want* to
Since the consumers run coca cola, put the cocaine back in my coca cola! Illegal, immoral, who cares, right?
What is this, corporation-ception or something?

Consumers don't want plastic, they still use it because that is all you are offering. Then to point to that like it's justification for wasteful pollution is lazy.

This is your problem Coca Cola. This is your brand. We expect you to come up with the sustainable solution and our use of less sustainable materials in the meantime is not justification or in any way an indication of our desire to continue doing so in such manner.
What a load of bull, we all know coke taste better in a can
Enviroment? We don’t need no steenking environment! —-Coca Cola
You heard it boys and girls. If you want them to change stop buying Coke in Plastic bottles. Glass or Tin or not at all.
They could switch to Aluminum only and have special bottles made and be leaders, but the problem is the weight and cost. They know if they lead the way the costs of their product will go up due to manufacture and shipping costs (look a the cost differences between the cans and bottles when you go the grocery store). They also know their hard core followers are not sustainable and they can't wait for others to follow their lead. I often see there are people who will buy whatever soda is on sale that week over their preferred brand which is why they won't change unless FORCED to change.
That's the solution right there. We're expecting a private company to be responsible on their own. They won't do that unless we force them.
Germany has a two way system: Reusable bottles with a deposit (15 ct.) and single use bottles but also with a deposit (25 ct.) on it. So the single use bottles are collected by the shops and the plastic is (supposedly) recycled.
Yeah. It's 90+ % return rate and it has been going on since 1996.

What makes the bottles reusable?
Almost like laws are the only thing that stops corporations from seeking the cheapest option. Almost like stronger laws for consumer and environmental protection are effective. I wonder why corproations keep lobbying against such laws. It is as if they don't have the best interests of anyone but their bottom line at heart. So weird.
Can you explain the reusable part a bit more? Is it a different type of plastic or something else?
Do you have any links/pics of the bottles?  Google doesn't show me anything.
The deposit is not mandated by law per say. Manufacturers are required to either pay an extra tax to the government or put a deposit in their packaging. They can do this by either joining an existing deposit system or create their own system (what Lidl did)
I literally only but bottles I can get money back from when recycling... I'm poor and I need that extra cash
Strange I remember every pop came in glass bottles as a 90's kid and they were sold for less then what were buying plastic bottles for now
If i had a time machine, that would be on my stop.   Buy some cocaine coke a cola while on my way to watch some roman gladiator fights.
I’d settle for corn free cane sugar.
And I'm sure they made that argument when cocaine became illegal.
Oh yes please!
Give the people what they want.
Just use Mason jars and go hog wild on the refills at McDonald's
This happened in many countries, including the UK and even South Africa.
Until plastic profits took over.

As a kid I remember collecting them and returning them for the deposit to buy a chocolate bar or something.
Glass recycling in the US is pretty much non existent. All the cullet usually ends up in a landfill.
We're at the point where funding into biodegradable substitutes for plastic would be better than going back to glass.

We have a basic understanding of how insects and other animals make things like wings, scales etc but much more research needs to be done to bring production costs down.

It's using enzymes to synthesize a plastic like substance that already exist in nature, basically reverse engineering. Imo that's the future but we're still at the beginning of it.
Glass weighs more too. So it wouldn't exactly offset plastic waste. Now it would be gasoline waste for transport.
There are certain EU areas where they have to take the bottles back and rinse / reuse them (Germany?). So it's never been about them not being able to do it, it's just not the cheapest method.
Yeah it also tasted better in a glass bottle
Am I crazy, or did Snapple recently forgo their glass bottles for plastic look-alikes?
And long before that - I remember the little ones they sold for vending machines, bottle opener on the front, and often the crates the bottles went back in were stacked close by. And bottlers were a local operation pretty much everywhere.
That’s exactly right. Plastic is cheap and easy. All about the bottom line and diabetes
With the styrofoam labels. Those were cool.
Was still buying them in the late 90s in Canada
In Prince Edward Island , Canada, they only had glass bottles available until recently (2007 or so) because of a deal with a bottling company located there I believe.  We used to joke about going over to the mainland and canned pop being some forbidden commodity
glass is much, much heavier than plastic - 6 to 8 times or more, meaning delivery trucks would be much heavier and would use more diesel fuel for deliveries, and that much more CO2 into the environment per mile. Glass is hardly economically friendly in that regard.
I remember this.  I can remember the milk crate type plastic containers with 4x 1 liter bottles IIRC.
In Sweden we had reusable 1.5l plastic bottles until like 2010. Don’t know why they removed them.
Yeah, glass bottles are Co2 nightmares.  
Pick your fight. Do you want to fight Climate change or fight Plastic.
I think you mean 1880s? Returnable glass coke bottles have existed for over 100 years
The lunch truck that comes to my work still has them. He has the Mexican coke bottles that are glass, and have real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. On the rare occasions where I drink a soda, it's always one of these. I'll buy one to stick in the fridge even on days I don't want one.
I’d prefer a can over a plastic bottle. The plastic bottle is my least favorite container for soda. Maybe it’s in my head, but it just tastes more syrupy and doesn’t have enough carbonation.
Yah, everyone seems to be skipping right over the fact you can reuse the same plastic bottles for months on end.

I think my last Powerade bottle lasted me for 6 months. It's easy to clean, weighs nothing, and won't break if dropped.

I must have reused it hundreds of times.
[Weird regulations](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VS.png) in the US... result in weird pricing...
I wish I saw this argument come up more often. Coke is the archetype of the duopoly, and people will literally buy coke no matter what it's packaged in. What else are people doing to do, starting drinking R/C?
Yes and no.  Consumers can and are surveyed for preferences, and going against preference can hurt sales by a certain percentage.  Soda is all about market share, so even a tiny differentiator can have a huge aggregate effect.  

The soda companies know this very, very well, so they collude.  One example is that all 3 remaining soda companies colluded last year to try and make package side changes universal.  That way no one soda maker could say they have a larger package than the other two.  And all three got to jack up their price per volume.
Dasani bottles were bioplastic if I remember correctly but Dasani sucks and I haven’t looked at a bottle in years
I like this solution better than an outright ban. The problem is not the free market or consumer choice - it's when consumer choices have negative externalities they don't pay for.
>Simple math shows that the can is a better value yet 99% of consumers in NA grab the plastic product.

I normally do this because they're the only resealable option. If there was a resealable, reusable option, I'd choose it any day.
Yes, I am sure Coke will feel it in their wallet in about 5 million years.
It’s sad when people see this as the ONLY avenue of change. What a lack of creativity.
Finally someone with some sense. Let the free market be free. The consumers will decide what they want. And what they want is inexpensive delicious convenience.
If people could stop buying/drinking soda, there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic.
Also shows that the average consumer doesn't give a fuck about environment.
Careful, that sounds suspiciously like expecting the people who care about something to take action themselves rather than demanding someone do it for them.
Why are people still buying the nutritionally void diabeetus water anyways?
They can't sell bottles to a dead consumer so there must be other forces at work.

They make American glass bottles too.
Most stores have aluminum cans and often glass bottles too. I rarely drink it but I buy the cans instead of bottles almost always.
They just don't see a future with coke and pot. There is no reason for them to invest in pot if they can't combine it with their business. Also I'm pretty sure that executives decisions are based on expensive market research.
Bingo.  Coca-Cola also has recycling bins at all major gas stations, in my market, that people fill with trash as they are pumping their gas.
They do sell it in glass bottles, but people don’t buy them as much because they’re more expensive.
Glass bottles are an absolute nightmare for distribution and warehousing.  When it comes to stacking pallets 4-5 high.  It also causes excess waste in the packaging they come in when purchased by the case.  They are typically in cardboard and then wrapped in heavy plastic multiple times for transport and to protect against breakage.

From a distribution standpoint, delivering massive amounts of product in glass results in a much higher turnover and injury rate for employees.  Right now, beverage handling and distribution is right behind mining in terms of accidents and injury rates.  

I’d love to see us use packages that we’ve used in the past.  I’ve kept most of them and am baffled as to why they didn’t take off.  I’d love to see a 20oz resealable can.  Here are some cool package types that I’ve saved:


https://imgur.com/a/KoZcdwU
We’re unwilling to accept any profit loss by changing packaging, thus we will blame consumers. 

Carbon tax it shall be, force these fuckers to either pay a stupid high tax for the pollution they create, or change to a fully recyclable product to reduce your tax. Coke would switch to glass and aluminum over night.
Glass bottles can be resealable. Just look at Snapple or the old  large glass coke bottles (750 ml in Canada).
Coca-Colaᵗʰᶦⁿᵏᶦⁿᵍ: 'we'll repeat 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘦𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘴 until the audience believes us' because this is what's best for short term profits.
This is the proper response. All the glass bottle posts are short-sighted.
No way. Aluminum is the most valuable of all household recyclables. Last I saw cans were bringing like 35 cents a pound. I doubt any aluminum is going to a landfill once it hits a sorting facility.

Recycling aluminum is much cheaper than refining bauxite into virgin aluminum, it gets recycled on an industrial scale all the time. I work at a machine shop, and the most valuable scrap we generate is our aluminum chips.
This is true. We lived there from 2011 to 2014. You can get some things in plastic, but most restuarants will give you glass bottles. A lot of the bottles have a ring around the center where they bang together. I wish the US would adopt it.
It takes WAY more energy to produce aluminum bottles than plastic. There's a reason aluminum is sometimes referred to as 'solid energy'. And as energy is consumed, carbon footprint from grid level energy production goes up. 

It's also substantially more expensive to make aluminum bottles than plastic, meaning costs go up, and those costs have to be offloaded onto the consumers. 

And if they simply get pitched instead of recycled, we're no better off.
So buy the products in aluminum cans?  They sell single serve bottles, cans, and glass almost everywhere.
If only there were some weakness in the supply chain that we could exploit to force a private company to behave in a certain way.
Yup, capitalism won't price in externalities. We need to have taxes for things like carbon and pollution so over time they are reduced through competition
They did used to have reusable bottles.

It got them blamed for polio during the scare before they figured out the cure.
The private company simply reacts to consumer demand.  Consumers dont want expensive reusable bottles they want dirt cheap ones so they can drink a gallon a day.
this is what I dont understand peoples viewpoint of total hating all types of government. being governed by a body whose primary goal is profit is not a good situation
But we dont expect the consumer to hold them accountable? Only laws.
Golly gee, it's almost like regulations make the world better.

Unfortunately, Mr pile, there's a large contingent who'd rather spend the time debating who is worth saving
No! Free markets will dictate what is best and governments should be toothless! /s
1 word.

# Profits
Yes, but we could just stop buying their products. Obviously, coke and others sodas are not wealthy.
Ja, I know... That's how I get free beer in Germany. ;)  With 2-3 empty bottles you get one pint of decent beer.
Supposedly aka sold to shithole countries that dump it to the ocean so we can be smug and blame *them* for polluting
Hard plastic bottles and you can’t squish them together. It’s like a glass bottle, but unbreakable.
It's way harder. Feels almost as tough as glass. You can push a dent in the bottle with your finger. You can destroy it by twisting it but it takes a lot of effort.

...you could just do coke nowadays.
Yo take a pic of Cleopatra while you're back there. I want to see what all the fuss was about.
Why go for soda when you can go for booze? Vin Mariani was wine and coke and I always wonder how many heart attacks it caused.
I mean back then you could just straight up buy most drugs. A lot of armies in WW2 used meth to give their soldiers super human stamina and alertness.
Mexican coke
I prefer a big stone jug with a cork in it
Cashing the bottle and can deposit was my primary source of income as a middle schooler in Michigan.
They still do this in Mexico.
> As a kid I remember collecting them and returning them for the deposit to buy a chocolate bar or something.

As a kid, I remember pulling shards of broken glass out of my feet and soda going everywhere if you accidentally dropped a bottle and it shattered. Going back to the good ol' days of glass would be like going to the good ol' days of out houses.
They weren’t recycled, they were returned, washed and sterilized and refilled.
I heard some college lecture about recycling where the guy said there's a program where they add crushed glass to asphalt for road paving. And the audience thought that was great, just great. 

Meanwhile, I'm wondering why they can't just re-use a bottle as a bottle, like they used to do.
The advantage of glass when it is not recycled is it reverts to sand fairly quickly. Throw glass waste in the ocean. It's heavy so it sinks to the ocean floor. In less than a year a bottle will return to its constituent components: sand. 

The problem with plastic is as it breaks down it will always be long chain hydrocarbon molecules that retain the properties of plastic. Long chain hydrocarbon molecules are extremely durable. It's why plastic is such a useful material. It's light so it's readily circulated in ocean currents. It can float easily. It takes years, decades to break down. It wreaks havoc on the environment. 

I would much rather glass be openly thrown into the environment than plastic being shuffled around the world to be thrown in the environment when no one is looking.
Glass in a landfill is still significantly less damaging than plastics. Glass is inert, and breaks down into sand over time (slowly)

Plastics generally don't break down at all, break down into microplastics that don't break down and slowly kill marine and invertebrate life, or break down into toxic carcinogens that damage the environment.

What is worse, is that plastic and oil producing companies are funding multiple disinformation campaigns to get people to keep using their cheap single-use plastics over better alternatives. And it's working.
>Glass recycling

Not quite glass recycling in the US is at about 33% vs 90% in Europe.
My town takes glass and turns it into road base to repave and repair roads with
If I'm not mistaken biodegradable plastic already exists.
But it would stop some plastic from being dumped everywhere including our oceans.

Glass is basically sand. Plastic is petro chemicals. Micro glass doesn’t end up in our blood stream and in the bodies of our food chain. Micro plastics do.

There is more than one consideration when looking at what defines pollution.
Localize refilling plants, cut down on transportation distance, create jobs in the community. I'm not seeing a downside to any of this.
Plastic pollution is much more than just green house gases. The shit is inside us now and causing all sorts of problems for organisms.       
     
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/plastic-pollution/
They have made some plastic ones for quite some time, but yes I think they recently changed to all plastic now.  I rarely buy any beverages that aren't in aluminum cans, although I mostly just drink water anyway.
I remember my local distributor switching from the ones that needed the opener to the resealable tops.. man, I am feeling old !
Those are the ones!
No, I meant the resealable screw top for freshness bottles...
I made the mistake of thinking they were healthier since they were made with real sugar. Turns out that shit makes you just as fat as the corn syrup kind, just tastes more natural
Imo this is mostly the head bc we drink cans in one sitting while we can close the bottle and drink It later the day when its stale. A fresh bottle always tastes good.
What's wrong with the Nobel Royal Crown cola? I find Pepsi to be to sweet and Coke to be a little to acidic for my liking. But the fine folks at Royal Crown have found a delightful balance of carbonated brown sugar water.
Ideally they'd switch to water and bankrupt coca cola.
RC Cola and a Moon Pie.
> What else are people doing to do, starting drinking R/C?

Why is this so ridiculous? Coke hardly has a "dupoly". There are dozens of other brands out there.

People need to start taking responsibility and this is a golden example of someone shirking it. "I only like Pepsi and Coke so I am forced to buy one or the other". There are so many others that you can buy. Or better yet, don't buy any at all.
Pepsi Max is the superior beverage. Anyone who disagrees with me has to fight me.
We had an aluminum Monster can with a very small plastic flap on top that allowed it to be resealed.  Due to different recycling laws in each state it was hard to produce and distribute.  My state doesn’t allow any single product to be aluminum AND plastic in the same container.  There can be an aluminum can and a plastic bottle in the same recycling bin, but not combined in the same product for sorting purposes (just a guess).

I rarely buy PET products because I’m aware of the packaging types we carry.  I think aluminum canned soda or glass tastes better anyways.  At my stores we typically have 2-4 rows of glass bottles in the cooler.  It sells, but at a rate of about 50:1.  Perhaps it’s because consumers reach for plastic out of habit, they don’t see the glass bottles, or maybe because they don’t have an opener.  Maybe a combination of all three.  Also keep in mind, distributing glass products is substantially heavier and requires more commercial vehicle use.  So, there are benefits to both products IF the items are recycled properly by EVERYONE.

Now, I can go a few blocks away to a Hispanic or Asian foods store and the product line completely shifts as sales are so different.  They mainly sell Coke, Sprite, Fanta, Fanta Pineapple, etc.  The glass bottles sell there and fly off the shelves.  Is this because their customer base likes Imported soda better?  Is it what they are just used to it?  Is it because they care about the environment more?  I know a lot of immigrants avoid corn syrup like it’s the plague.  If it isn’t cane sugar they stay away.

If we developed a better package and even slightly raised prices consumers really wouldn’t care very much.  I’ve seen prices nearly double in the time I’ve been with Coca-Cola in regards to single serve products.  It would be a massive undertaking to shift bottling and production to accept a new and improved package type.  No company would ever just absorb those costs.  We need global behavioral change and everyone needs to be on board.
I think this is only true in North America. Here, 2.25 litre bottles are far better value than cans. I don't know anyone that buys cans.
Honestly, this is why consumers grab the plastic bottle version over the aluminum can.

Stop at a gas station, grab a coke for the road? I don't want that spilling all over my car with an opened aluminum can, whereas the plastic bottle will let me seal it to prevent spills and keep the carbonation.

Outside of drinking a soda specifically in a moving vehicle, I have no opinion as to packaging (plastic, glass, aluminum).
They'd feel it in a week if enough people participated. The world isn't just you and Coke. 

This "just me" attitude is how idiots get elected to public office.
You got a better suggestion? I’d love to hear it.
Every little bit counts and it adds up quickly!
Why can’t the consumers collectivize their voice and democratically regulate them? That’s also “letting consumers decide what they want”.
OK I’ll guess I’ll go by the Coke that’s in a reusable... oh wait. It’s literally not an option where I live
Imagine a city with no parking regulations. Imagine leaving parking up to personal responsibility instead of demanding that the government does it for you. 

Vehicles would get left in streetside parking for days or weeks

vehicles would be parked by the corner of an intersection, making it hard for people to see if it's ok to turn. 

Vehicles would get left in alleys in ways that blocks the trash truck from accessing the dumpster


In this scenario you wouldn't complain about people asking the government to take action would you?
Yup, I haven't bottle plastic bottles in ages. Tastes like shit coming out of plastic bottle
And waste more energy creating and transporting and are more fragile and add nothing to the experience of drinking the beverage...
We have glass and aluminum.  We produce what sells.  People buy what is convenient for them when it comes to single serve.  I’d love to see a resealable aluminum can.  Oh wait, we tried that, and it didn’t sell and the packaging was discontinued.  

People need to start recycling and stop being assholes and throwing their waste in the landfills.
Glass isn't lightweight though in comparison to aluminum or plastic.
Didn't Snapple switch to plastic recently? The bottle still looks the same, but the last time I bought a Snapple it was a plastic bottle.
Oh, good.  I was upset to think that all those cans I recycled were going to waste.  Now I won't worry about it.  Thank you.
Coke will not change because it would increase their product cost while other competitors would stay the same. Legislation is needed to make all companies have the same requirements.
[removed]
It won't happen. Not because people are too lazy, or apathetic, or have ill intentions. They seriously just don't know. Everywhere I go, I make sure to ask them not to give me single use plastics like bags or straws. On many occasions they look at me as if I'm talking some alien language and ask me "but why?", and some places just keep trying to give it to me as I'm asking them not to. Too many people are completely unaware about what's going on, and that's exactly how companies want it. It's bullshit to say "people want single use plastics". The honest answer would be "it's cheaper for our company and people don't know any better".
Yeah that will never work with Coke selling around the entire world. Our government represents our will, it's not the citizens responsibility to create a separate movement that tries to convince people that they should join to boycott. That's what voting is for! It's up to our representatives to follow our wishes and not their corporate donors.
Like water?
You realize that people organizing to do that is exactly what a democratic government passing a law is, right?
That's where [cap-and-trade policies](https://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works) really come in handy. They're also not a tax, although they are frequently mislabeled a "tax" in order to mislead the public into opposition.
Taxes don't influence the manufacturer but create and influence consumer behaviour. 

Many years ago (70's -80's) drinks companies had a deposit scheme for the glass bottles and shops would take them as payment towards sweets and stuff ( a kids dream). The drinks company would collect the bottles and refund the shop but it faded when plastics became the norm because it was cheaper and collecting was costly.  It wasn't a govt tax it was run by the drinks co.
politicians will lose their jobs over those bills lol.  AKA never going to happen.

What actually needs to happen is we need actual real advancement in recycling facilities.  Government could easily fund that with the 4.5 trillion they spend every year.
Then that needs to be addressed too. I'm not saying ban soda, but certainly the pervasive advertising should be curtailed and a tax be placed on it. If cigarettes and alcohol are taxed out the ass, why does ridiculous amounts of sugar get a pass?
Private companies don’t merely react to consumer demand - they can also shape it and create it. Mainly through marketing but even the mere creation of a new product can create demand for it because it’s simply new and different.
The people in power of political bodies have a profit motive themselves as well. Let’s not act like the alternative to capitalism is benevolent overlords. No, you just take the capitalists (who don’t have the ability to throw you in prison for dissent) and replace them with a governmental ruling class.
> But we dont expect the consumer to hold them accountable? 

No. Organizing consumer behavior is nice in theory, in reality it just doesn't work very well. Hence, laws.

That's kind of the double edged sword of market based systems. They're designed so individual actions/optimization lead to certain outcomes without needing coordination. The flipside is they aren't really good for broad coordination when it's needed for collective action problems.
Why not both? We live in a democracy, so if the government holds them accountable, that IS the consumers holding them accountable. We expect our government to represent us and our collective power. That's what it's for. In practice it doesn't always work perfectly, but there is no reason to give up on it entirely.
No, any minute now the Free Market (™) will release an environmentally sustainable product. They only stopped because you didn't believe in the Free Market (™).
Too much fentanyl contaminating everything. It's a bad time to want drugs.
Coke and red wine is still a fairly popular drink. Makes it go down a lot easier.
It's a lot of people's source of income in Germany and Scandinavia
There is a deposit on EVERY type of food container (not just bottles)  in Alberta, Canada.  This is a major source of income for homeless people and you can bet there is very little garbage in the streets of Calgary. Win-Win.
Look at you with you 10cent deposits!   I swear.  If I can figure it out I’ll drive truck loads of bottles and cans frOM NY to Michigan. Just got to figure out the numbers...
That and use actual sugar instead of corn syrup.

I love Mexi-Cola.
Labor is also cheaper there.
So they were reused, which is even better than recycling.
In Bolivia we have glass bottles that are returned, cleaned and refilled. There are also thick plastic ones, 2L I think, that are also returned. If my memory doesn’t fail me we also have thin plastic bottles and those aren’t returned. This has been going on for quite a long time.
This still happens in Mexico.  You'll get soda bottles with lots of scratches on them because of the constant reuse.
[deleted]
so... they were put back into rotation.... 

That's one of the methods of recycling, bub.

You don't have to melt it down and reprocess it into raw materials if its already in a usable form. Doing so unnecessarily is just wasteful.
Sounds like good savings for the company. Why did they stop? Was it that expensive?
>Meanwhile, I'm wondering why they can't just re-use a bottle as a bottle, like they used to do.

They do, in nation's where the regulations require it.
If the glass bottle can be reused for its original purpose (coke bottle being reused for coke) then its great. However, if it has to be broken down and re-formed into something else its not so great. The energy to transform glass into another usable form besides broken negates the positive effect of recycling.

So in short there's a place for both reusing the bottle and breaking it down for use in asphalt.
The trade off though is that glass has a much higher carbon footprint to produce and transport.
Theowing glass to the bottom of the ocean will not solve anything.
Glass does not magically revert to sand.

Those famous rum bottles that are found in su k ship, still full of deinkable rum attest to that.
Also the glass windows  in all the european churches n stuff. 


If you were ruler and everyone threw glass to the sea we would have seas full of broken glass and fish fileting themselves at random...
This would only be true if you discarded the glass at the shoreline where waves and sand would break up the glass. Anywhere else and it just sits on the bottom.
[You couldn't be further from being right. It takes 10,000+ years to break down class in a natural environment.](https://sciencing.com/long-glass-bottle-degrade-landfill-17886.html)
> The advantage of glass when it is not recycled is it reverts to sand fairly quickly. Throw glass waste in the ocean. It's heavy so it sinks to the ocean floor. In less than a year a bottle will return to its constituent components: sand.

That's absolutely false.
Have you any evidence that glass just breaks down into sand after a year?
It does but it isn't cheap enough for companies to switch over so very few are willing to do it.

There's also issues with the strength when you try to make bigger containers and they typically can't be used to hold the same liquids.

They exist, we just need to get better at making them.
While I do agree with you, I think we should shift our focus to finding new methods around any kind of environmentally damaging products or processes. Plastics are bad for the environment and human health, CO2 emissions from increased distribution loads is bad the for the environment and human health. A lot of advancement and ingenuity will be required to solve these issues and reverting to old methods is the wrong way of thinking IMO.
So do bottle deposits. Every state that has implemented one has seen over 90% reduction in the amount of soda bottles and cans that end up in landfill.
Bottling plants are already as close to consumers as possible to minimize shipping costs.

Every time Coca-Cola or Nestle tries to open a new bottling plant to further reduce transportation fuel usage everyone screams bloody murder about stealing water.

You can't have it both ways.
I don't drink coke much but it seems to taste much nicer out of a can or glass bottle than a plastic one.
Oh shit forgot those were a thing
Anything with calories can make you fat. There's been studies that show that HFCS may be digested differently than less processed sugars and may lead to health complications, but nothing has been proven. Its best to avoid empty calories in general and just avoid sugary drinks, no matter what sugar is used. 

I say this as someone who formerly loved Coca Cola but hasn't had one in four years.
Nah it’s not. I swear maybe it’s all in my head, but the can just has more bite. That good carbonation burn lol
Bottles can and do leak carbon gas more readily than cans.  The gasket isn't perfect, which you can prove by opening a year-old bottle versus a year-old can.  It's something that would take time to result in a significant difference, so the bottlers would say that within the expiration period there's not a difference.
I feel RC Cola is very similar to Pepsi in taste but not as carbonated.
Hecho en Mexico Coca Cola from a glass bottle may change your mind. Cold and over ice.
Coke and Pepsi happily sell tons of plain water.
This is true for the case of purchasing for private consumption from grocers (at least in any sizable market, not sure if the 22 folk of Mildred Montana get Cott sodas).

But try getting a bottle of Jones or Faygo or Grapico at your local Six Flags or Sporting arena.
I'm with you, and when I drink soda I go for boutique stuff. But my point is that they have so much market share that they functionally have a duopoly.

It isn't like fast food joints, movie theaters, and convenience stores are overflowing with options like Maines root and Jones
It all depends what package you are buying and where.

Typical gas station:

20oz:  $1.89
2LT:  $2.09
1LT: $2.39
Twelve pack: $5.99

With all these package types people typically grab what they want to consume at the moment.  I’ve heard people complain about how much a 2LT costs and then grab two 20oz bottles and pay almost $4.  Its all about convenience.

Now, go to a grocery store and people can only buy single service products by the checkout registers.  Grocery stores run promotions on 12 packs like “4 for $9”.  When they do that, we are literally delivering soda by the pallet.  I’ve seen numerous stores accept an entire semi DAILY.  They will also sell the .5LT six packs for like $2.50.  Typically, off ad they are around $5.  People will complain about those prices, but once again they’ll grab the 20oz at the register and pay a lot more for a lot less.

The consumers brain is very interesting.  Trying to have hundreds of products in dozens of different packaging types without having wasted and expired product is a difficult task.
I touched base in a previous reply.  We HAD a resealable can with a very very small plastic tab.  Because of recycling laws we were forced to discontinue it.  It’s not that we CANT do it.  It’s that different states have different recycling laws.
When they launched New Coke, they lost thirty million dollars in three months recalling un purchased product, never mind the brand damage.

Companies are just a reflection of consumer demand.
Vote for politicians who will introduce regulations that represent what you want the company to do. Laissez faire capitalism is not the only tool humans have to create a better world
Their margins are like 20x on a bottle.
What about aluminum cans
Do you REALLY need soda?
So dont buy it.
dont buy it then lul
You can always just not buy Coke.
This is a fair argument, and I don't get why you were downvoted. When a consumer behavior has negative externalities, government regulation can sometimes be the fairest and most efficient solution.
No, someone would recognize that people demand parking, so someone would build a parking complex. People would pay a nominal fee in order to avoid parking on the street.

This literally happens in every city.
people dont seem to understand the amount of diesel fuel and CO2 emissions required to move an 18 wheeler filled with glass bottles vs. plastic. In a lot of cases the glass is heavier than the liquid itself.
[deleted]
If people cared they would pressure Coke.  People don't really care so they don't.

If people don't care, politicans have no mandate from their constituents to force such a thing.
The only problem is that the people with hammers see us all as nails.
This comment reminded me of ‘casino’
How about starting with a real deposit on bottles. 5-10 cents it should be a quarter and make it retroactive . I bet you would see more people picking up or returning bottles more. Maybe a dollar for liquor bottles. If you are spending 50 on a bottle of Jack Daniels what’s a dollar more.
I take all the plastic bags i can get my hands on.  I need a place to put my plastic oj bottle, my 6 pack of individual puddings, my pasta with the superfluous plastic window, my meat sitting on styrofoam wrapped in plastic, and my fresh vegetables that I used a plastic bag from the roll to keep safe.

Yeah, fuck plastic bag bans until we actually make some real god damn change.
If there isn't the political will to buy another product or not but a product at all what makes you think that the political clout will exist to effect these changes?

Perhaps you may be overestimating how much the average voter cares about the issue.
One of those things requires a change of law while the other requires a change of behavior.

One addresses the behavior of the consumer that will translate to other industries, products and consumer consumption.

Which one is more effective?
Many states have bottle and can deposits now! It's a nice little system that helps the homeless out by getting them some cash and making sure these materials are somewhat recycled responsibly, at least in theory.
ideally, the constitution would keep government in check, whereas corporations dont have a consitutiton.
Good point. If I had a time machine I would go to the 80s and do coke.
You need to go to the source
It's a lot of people's source of income in metropolitan America too.
I remember when i was a kid visting my cousins in Sweden. We wanted to go to the internet cafe and play games and drink soda, and they were like we will just pick up bottles lol. We picked up only a couple plastic bottles each that were litter, went to the store, put them in a machine and then given a ticket for cash. 

Had enough to play games all night, drink soda, and eat candy lol. I remember wishing we had it in America.
Just need a mail truck.
Hahahah cola in Spanish means tail and is often used as slang for ass. Mexi ass!
Over the last few years in DFW these little mexican chicken shacks have started popping up.

Half chicken with beans and rice, avocado salsa, mexican coke for 10 or 12 dollars. I am so addicted.
They don't anymore actually due to anti-obesity regulations. 

The Coke they make to send to the states uses actual sugar, the stuff they make and keep in mexico isn't allowed to anymore. It uses a mix of sugar and artificial sweeteners.
Yeah, and the name of the city where the bottles were produced was cast into the bottom of the bottle. It was always fun when we'd find a bottle that originated on the other side of the country. 

I always wondered how many times a bottle would be refilled. Lots of them would have chips out of the base, or have scratches or areas that looked sanded.
Reducing is even better, which is why I generally refuse to buy bullshit sugary beverages in bullshit plastic bottles.
The downside I've heard from anti-advocates is that it takes a lot of water, the water has to be hot, and the expense of the equipment. 

I'd bet that it takes less water to wash a glass bottle than to make a plastic one. 

There was also a move to ban glass bottles completely. Some kid in Washington state had a dog cut its paw on some broken glass, and he went viral at the time, and got the state legislature to ban them. Not quite sure why beer has never been sold in plastic, however.
You have to take into account the entire supply chain as well.  Glass is heavier so shipping over land requires more trips for the same amount of product (did they ever even do 2 litre glass bottles?)
Is that true with reusable glass?
What would you rather have polluting your environment: Glass or plastic? I've had three people, including yourself, dispute my statement. Ok, fine. I don't have documented proof and perhaps my statement was overly optimistic. 

Each time, you guys use examples of glass remaining in the environment long term in protected micro-environments, that prevents them from being exposed to erosive forces, but in no case are you able to demonstrate how glass is a bigger threat than plastic. 

Rum bottles in a sunken ship.....what animal did those bottles entangle and kill? Which animals are more prone to the accumulation of rum bottles in their digestive tracts? None, and none.
Here's the title of your article:

>How Long Does it Take for a Glass Bottle to Degrade in a Landfill?

There's a reason I said "thrown into the environment". It is exposed to erosion.
Nah, it tastes way less sweet. I know all of them  are sugar water, but pepsi literally tastes like just that.
Worked for a rival in the mid 90's. Learned that at THAT time the cost to produce a 12oz can of soda - aluminum and all - was 2 cents.
I mean, corporations already dump toxic waste in nature all the time.
But the can’t pressure just Coke. It has to be all of the manufactures at the same time or there will never be a change. People, to make the change need to make the politicians care. Not Coke.
People are starting to care, and politicians are starting to legislate. It's not that people are apathetic to the issues at hand, rather it's simply a non factor in their daily lives. It requires proper communication and organization for such a thing to start making its mark in the general social sphere.

Atleast as it is evidenced by the newly passed regulations on single use plastics in the United States, and even the styrofoam container ban in my native Illinois, things are beginning to shift.
Michigan has a 10 cent deposit on any single use carbonated beverage container. we have a 98% return rate. I dont know what happens to the plastics, but the cans are aluminium. i assume they get turned into another can.
Like it used to be?
The Beer Store in Ontario has had this as their system since opening. They have the world's largest recycling program as well and that's no coincidence.

> We are one of the few retailers in North America that takes back all the packaging we sell. Bottles, cans, cardboard packaging, bottle caps, plastic rings and bags, you name it – if we sell it – we take it back.

.

> In fact, we take back more than we sell! For years we have been taking back Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) beer containers and with the introduction of the Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP) in 2007, we began to accept back for deposit refund all liquor containers over 100ml – wine, spirits and coolers.

.

> We take back all the bottles, cans, cartons, caps, kegs, plastic bags and can rings that we sell to consumers, as well as from the 19,850 bars and restaurants we sell our products to. In fact, we’re a global leader in this practice. All collected materials are either reused or recycled.
We have an impressive recovery rate of 96% on the industry standard bottle. Ours is undoubtedly the most successful waste diversion program in Ontario, if not all of North America.


.

> "It's one of the most advanced and efficient recycling programs in the world," said David Soberman, marketing professor at the University of Toronto. 

Luckily, our PM is working on killing it though.
I lived in Uruguay in the 90s and that was a thing. You could return bottles for a couple cents, and even a discount if you planned on buying the same product of the bottles you were returning. Glass too (back then there were as many glass soda bottles as there were plastic).

I don't think they still do that anymore, though.
In my neighborhood there's a team of people who come by in a pickup truck and dig the bottles out of recycle bins out on the street the evening before trash day. I don't mind them, they're polite and don't make a mess.
... I mean bottle return is absolutely a thing in America?
I stand by my statement.
Probably explains the qotsa song then.
The cleaning was pretty superficial, so that's how polio spread.
unfortunately the industry hasn't felt your boycott but here's hoping more join the effort.  I work in ad testing and when not contemplating suicide I get to see all the plans for next to market sugar waters...They're certainly plowing ahead as usual.
It’s insane to make a plastic bottle Single use.  I reuse this big bottle of sparkling water my wife used and it’s perfect. It’s not pretty. But it has a screw cap that reseals and it’s see through so unlike metal bottles, I know if there’s anything floating in the water and how much water I have. And if it gets damaged I will throw it away. But I’ve refilled it more than 20 times.  It’s a thick flexible clear plastic material that lasts a long time. I can’t believe you’d just toss it into the landfill to sit there forever after one single use.
Amen brother/sister
This. The 20 oz bottles are the worst thing ever invented next to KCups. Most people don't even seem to finish a whole bottle and throw them away still half full of soda. At least aluminum cans can be easily recycled or compacted down to almost nothing.
its poison in trash
wait what? you don't recycle plastic bottles in the US?

Here in Europe we have a green container for glass, a yellow one for plastic (mostly bottles and such), a blue one for cardboard and paper, and the old normal one for rotten shit (which you can technically use for everything, and that's what a lot of people do).
You'd have to take the whole production line into account to fairly compare them.  Do the virgin plastic bottles include the petroleum extraction costs?  Refineries?  Plastics manufacturing?  etc.  If they just focus on the single step of actually forming the bottle then they are being a bit dishonest.

The real reason I assume is they don't want to deal with the bottle return process and the sorting probably can't be fully automated.  You need people to really sort the material coming in.
You can buy beer in plastic. But it’s gonna be Olde English, Steel Reserve, that tyoe
can will catch on more with craft brewing growing. cans seal better and help prevent the beer from affects of UV.
When I used to work for a beer distributor, plastic beer bottles made an appearance starting around 2002 or so. They were very limited availability (we only sold them to one account in town) because only one production line made them but apparently the plastic was a development problem too. Shelf life was a concern, I think the plastic was some kind of multiple layers to keep co2 from diffusing out and oxygen in. I vaguely recall that because of that, they weren’t recyclable. The reason I felt customers didn’t like them was that if you drank one, say outside where it was warm, the beer would still be cold while the neck of the bottle was warm. To me, it made the beer *seem* as though it didn’t taste right. 


I was just a delivery person though, I might be remembering part or all of this wrong. Maybe the techs gotten better, or just dropped completely.
Beer probably isn’t sold in plastic due to its UV sensitivity. It’s why most beer is in brown glass bottles, it’s the most protective against UV light.
I believe they break even once you reuse the glass bottle three times. (Not recycle, but refill). It basically comes down to the fact that glass requires a lot more material and is heavier, which means it uses more energy to manufacture and more fuel and oil to ship. I don’t know what the average reuse rate is for pop bottles, but glass is inferior for things like peanut butter, baby food and other products where you’re looking at recycling instead of reusing.
We are not „disputing“ your statement nor saying what is better or not.

We are calling out the source-less made up bullshit your wrote that glass will magically turn to sand in less than a year. Since that is the basis of your whole argument we need not dispute further.
Michigan makes it very easy to return too. Pretty much everyone who sells a bottle will take one as cash. Transplanting to Alberta they have a similar deposit, but you must return to a specific 'bottle depot' shop.
It was like that in the US also.  I remember returning glass soda bottles in the 80s as a child for money to buy more soda.
Hell right

I too boycott the shitty bottles (by not drinking soft drinks). Good for me and the environment!
A word of warning, reusing plastic bottles for a long time means the bottle will start leaking BPA.

https://www.healthline.com/health/reusing-plastic-bottles#safety-precautions
Ive heard a lot of microplastics are ingested when using plastic bottles, especially rrpeatedly over time. I might just invest in a nice durable travel bottle.
Don't do that. It's terrible for your health. You can buy metal water bottles with caps if you prefer that method.
I’ve used the same Gatorade bottle at work for probably two years now. We have filtered water, I fill it halfway up and throw it in the freezer, then top it off and have unlimited free ice water every day. It’s a stout bottle, it’s dumb something so beefy is intended for one use.
I worked for a summer as an intern for a company that specializes in landfill gas reclamation (methane), and one thing that blew my mind was how when you drill down into a capped landfill, the material down there is still in the exact condition it was in when it went in. Newsprint is still readable. The fact that people can throw anything in the trash at all without thinking about the fact that it's just going to sit in a hole until *long* after we're gone now blows my mind. 

IMO, everyone should be required to spend a day, week, or month at the landfill. It's where literally all of our unrecycled waste goes.
Glass bottles won't leech BPA into your water. Be careful, stranger.
When I buy a bottle of water it is intention of reusing the bottle as much as for the water.
get a thermoflask or something like that. much better. no leaking BPA.
God forbid we create jobs.
Frosty Jack!
Wait like plastic 40s or something..?
Plastic pollution is not just a carbon foot print issue, though. It's an environmental hazard for every level of the food chain. They're now finding that plastic is affecting top predators, plankton and everything in between. 

Personally, I'm of the belief that we don't yet know the full extent of the dangers of plastic pollution on the biosphere. When we do, it's likely going to be at a point of catastrophe.

I would really like to see plastic use stop, but looking at everything in my life that uses plastic, I know that's impossible.
Will it not leak BPA on the shelf as well? According to the article you linked we should avoid #7 code plastics altogether.
You don't even need to invest much. You can get a Nalgene sent to your door for under $10. BPA free and it'll last you many years to come. Usually, the first thing that wears out on mine is the lid, and I can replace that for cheap, avoiding having to purchase an entirely new bottle.
This is silly. I mean it's true, but we consume far more plastic in our water and food. Since we are consuming it every day against our will as a kind of status quo, singling out individual products that are affected is only a self delusion. It can't be avoided, it's already inside all of us, and we simply don't know what that means, yet.
Unless it's stainless that metal bottle probably has a plastic lining.
What bothers me is that they are dumped into dry sarcophagi. There’s the potential for *some* of the debris to decompose instead, but doing so safely is more than most landfillers want to deal with, between the potential for heat combustion and the possibility of liquids leeching into ground water. I wish composting was more practical on a large scale.
A month in the landfill, what kind of eco-sadist are you?
My well-off inlaws switched to using paper plates for meals some time ago, because it's just easier to toss everything than to load the dishwasher.  That's when I realized we were fucked, just totally fucked.  They burn all their cardboard because the county charges $40 for a curbside recycling bin.  FIL just went through a lung cancer scare.  He's still smoking and burning shit every day.  Literally being threatened with *death* won't change their habits, what possibly could?
I read about an archeological dig into an old dump.  They dug down to a layer from the 40s and not only found virtually undamaged newspaper like you said but also things like hot dogs that looked like they were dumped yesterday.
Landfills are going to be archeological goldmines centuries from now when the remnants of the human race are trying to figure out what the fuck happened.
Though virgin glass requires a lot of energy to make.  Everything has a catch.
Economy is at full employment. Who's going to fill these jobs?
I totally agree. I think something that I see missing in a lot of discussion about climate and sustainability is reduction in consumption. Everyone is looking (fairly) for someone to blame, or the next substitute for their favorite product, but when all is said and done, there is just way too much consumption. I don't think it should only be a matter of glass v plastic, but maybe it should be, "do you really need that plastic or glass thing in the first place?"
Not just that, a couple of years ago a study shows practically all plastic leaks estrogen-like chemicals

https://www.npr.org/2011/03/02/134196209/study-most-plastics-leach-hormone-like-chemicals

But they alternatives to BPA are starting to come out to be just as bad https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30861-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218308613%3Fshowall%3Dtrue
I recommend a Bubi bottle or a Kleen Canteen.
You'd have to pump air and water into them but like you said then you'd have leeching.
The glass isnt allowed to have sex? That's fucked.
If you pay more than food service industry, and provide training people will work these jobs. But everything will cost a little more. So people will buy less and corporations will have smaller margins.

This is good for the planet but bad for shareholders' bottom lines. So it will never happen
Consumption, especially planned obsolescence is how I know government and corporations are not serious about reduction of pollution. Then you go into the stores and all those rows and rows of nothing but plastic nik-naks......yeah....ok.
This is a great point. Convenience and profits rule the land. Vending machines in every corner and 24 packs of water bottles that cost $4. Why not make a push to make filters cheaper?

Recently I've also noticed how much waste the fast food industry probably generates. You get a combo meal and 5 minutes later, there's like 10 pieces of wrapping and containers that will just go to the trash. There has to be a better way to do it.
Glass is always the best if you manage to not break it
Yep. I get why it’s impractical but it doesn’t stop me from wishing someone smarter than I could figure out safe and cost effective ways around the complications.
Individually plastic-wrapped potatoes. Every time I see them in the store I feel bad about society and our planet.
Aw. He’s a billionaire but all he wants is a simple life as a farmer.
[Isn't this the guy that was farting on the red carpet?](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=kUe9ICdtkJ4&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrJdMFyxd8ps%26feature%3Dshare)
5,000 plants in his plane?  I’m wondering if it was like a rain forest of green walking into that plane...
From article:

A Greek billionaire has been detained on the Caribbean Island of St. Kitts after a search of his private jet yielded approximately £1 million of cannabis totalling approximately 5,000 plants, an unknown number of seeds and a variety other cannabis products.

Isle of Man resident Alkiviades “Alki” David, 50, was arrested by the Anti-Narcotics Unit at the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport. He has been charged with Possession with Intent to Supply, Possession of Controlled Drugs and Importation of a Controlled Drug into the Federation after his plane was stopped by customs authorities.

David is a member of the Leventis family, who run the biggest commercial bottling facilities in Europe after a merger with beverage behemoth Coca-Cola bumped the family’s net worth to approximately £4.6 billion. David himself is estimated to be worth £2.6 billion.
Apparently it was hemp, not weed. Legal to grow.
Plants! Oh no! Have we lost our minds? Let’s arrest god for growing pot
Idiot. Surely he knows there’s a lot more money to be made with coke than with pot?!
If you had the power to let him pass as like the inspector or something... how much of a bribe would you need?  Two of these plants? Three?
this is the same guy who owns chief keef
"It was for personal use."
Real stoners drink pepsi.
"It's hemp you idiots!!! Oh what the Thc? We throw that away it's illegal."
Can we fast forward to the part where he totally gets off scot free.
I guess coca-cola is trying to go green.
Dude, have someone do this for you, Billionaire. Jebus, it's like the rich don't know how to use their money properly.
Hey Billionaire?  Why?
Ever seen a drug lord evade jail? Yeah? Good, cause thats exactly whats about to happen...
Green Acres is the place to be.   
Farm livin' is the life for me.   
Land spreadin' out so far and wide   
Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside.
should have just played Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon like I do.
He's researching their new product Canna-Cola.
It ain't much but it's honest work.
I don't think 5k plants is a simple life. Probably get pretty complicated with the amount of machinery involved that is required to maintain that kind of major operation. lol
What a fucking legend. So far all I know about this dude is he is rich, likes cannabis and purposefully farted on camera mid-interview.
Apropos user name on two fronts, for this particular thread.  Well done.
Just pulls the mic from her and drops ass into it lol
This man is a shiny golden God.
lol - I'm not generally a fan of the "toilet humor", but that was pretty fucking epic.
https://youtu.be/luwxbCT1QCY

A lot of Rockwool cubes.

Unless his "private jet" was a big cargo plane.
Not plants, "alleged" plants.
Why not post the more pertinent information of him running a medical cannabis company (CBD-focused) and the likelihood of these plants having THC in them is low.

They're either hemp or specific strains of low-THC, high-CBD plants.

It's not like this dude is running a drug cartel in his spare time.  But hey, maybe he's doing that too.
A billionaire that loves cannabis?  If only we could get this guy to lobby congress.
"beverage behemoth" is gonna be my new drinks company
Yeah "but police disagree". Funny how often they decide what exactly something is without lab testing. I'd be interested to see the results from an independent lab.
Think of all the lives those brave police officers saved by confiscating those inactive hemp plants.

If only one person can be saved from hippie hemp friendship bracelets, isn't the sacrifice of our freedoms, civil forfeiture, and justified police homicides worth it?
> Let’s arrest god for growing pot

https://youtu.be/Y6qHy44hxVE?t=8
sounds bad, what I meant is this is the same guy who signed chief keef to a 360 deal and basically shelved him
doodoodoodoodoo DOO DOO
He also just had to settle for $8.5M after firing someone for refusing to perform sex acts...
Sounds like someone I'd like to get stoned with and play some borderlands.
what op said is probably true, they are clones with probably very little roots at that stage. You can fit thousands of clones in a tray if you pack the rockwool cubes right.
Any not turn this around and ask "who gives a shit that someone is growing any type of weed anymore?"
Yeah but this is St. Kitts and Nevis, not the USA. Things may have changed, but when I lived there (2012) all of it was illegal.
To be fair that would literally be the perfect cover if you were.
Interesting. Had to fact check because I thought he was still signed to Interscope. He is in fact signed to FilmOn Media, owned by Alki David.
Damnit, can't people have drugs, money and a sense of humor without being assholes? As funny as the video was I hope someone farts in his general direction.
Yeah, I also couldn't tell from the article if he landed there with all of that and was searched before takeoff or if the implication was that he picked it all up from there.
Maybe...?  But there's enough money in the legitimate legal and medical side now, that it's just dumb.  He's already a billionaire, right?  So why would he bother?
The same reason  people with more money than they will ever need do stupid shit for more money.

Greed, boredom, or power.

The walton family has more money than they could spend in 4 generations if they bought a lamborgini every single day at a minimum but walmart still exploits labor at every single turn and bribes politicians all the time.
Could be wrong but thought he was trying to broker some type of deal with there government.
[deleted]
Shouldn't this be about everything in a bottle ever? Coke, Mountain Dew, etc.

Seems weird to focus on the water aspect when it should apply to everything that is bottled.
>To date, there is no evidence that supports that ingesting small pieces of plastic is harmful.

Is this their new slogan?
I don't know about any of you but Dasani always had the most plastic taste of any bottled water I've had. 
Dasani, ^^municipal ^^water ^^source*

*It's just tap water.
Start calling it "Vitamin P"
I had always assumed a fair amount of my diet was plastic and rat shit.
Idiotic baiting article. Plastics leach in liquids, period. Always have. The amount measured is on par with and bottled liquid in similar containers.


This isn't news. There want some "finally admitted!!" conspiracy crap.
Most bottled water tastes like the bottle. Doesn’t that alone indicate the presence of plastics? 
Bruh just buy a waterfilter from infowars to protect your family from the globalist microplastics!
Totally saw this while drinking Dasani water. Nice.
Shouldn’t consumers be allowed to sue them since they knowingly put our health at risk?
At first glance, I thought this was on r/nottheonion
You really needed them to confirm this? Dasani tastes like melted plastic.
If they can't get fucking water right, what the hell is slipping into Coke?
That's nothing, when Dasani was launched in the UK it turned out to be filtered tap water with added Benzene.
I just heard about this study on NPR, all bottled water has plastic in it. Coca-cola was the only one to admit that it had it. The study came to the conclusion that the same plastic can probably be found in every liquid in a plastic bottle.
What about soft drinks? 
“We found roughly twice as many plastic particles within bottled water as compared to tap water on average,” the study said.

Bottled water.....in plastic bottles.  
Thanks, study, I guess?

Well yeah how else will they hold the water?
Bottled water is one of the most surprising businesses to exist
So this is about Dasani and yet the picture used is of Nestle water. How confusing is that?
ITT: a lot of people ignorant about the ubiquity of microplastic.  This issue is far from exclusive to bottled water.

e.g. good luck finding *any* salt without it.
So, its probably in the municipal source they get the water from I presume?
[some people love Dasani though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoNHK7MAKdE)
Just market it as having microbeads to help clean your inside, it's the new Darsani microbead "cleanse". 
Why does anyone buy Desani or Evian?  They're both just filtered tap water.  Buy a filter and a stailess steel bottle. 
Flint is going to be a distant memory when people finally realize that there's plastic in literally all of the drinking water.  I don't know of any filters that sufficiently filter it out.  

For Coke to say that it's not a problem, I'm sure it's a matter of time before kidney failures become the new medical abyss.  
We leaned in biology that all plastic starts braking down as soon as UV light hits it.  My professor told us to use steel flask and such as opposed to any plastic bottle.
Dasani also has a bit of salt in it. Promoted as “minerals”, but it really just makes you slightly thirsty so you drink more and buy more. It’s literally on the bottle. Salt. 
I am so glad I never have drank a lot of bottled water, my coworker drank a 24 pack every week at work.
No, no, no. Those are just "flavor particles."
[Infographic comparing some brands](https://dpy68rfhp0glq.cloudfront.net/styles/small/s3/2017_Microplastics_BottledWater_Results_Graphic_desktop_0.jpg?itok=KAbA_JkB).  
  
San Pellegrino has the least amount, but who actually likes it?  
  
Evian is pretty good, with Dasani not far behind. Nestle is a joke by comparison. I wonder how SmartWater stacks up.
[deleted]
Is there an accumulative effect?  Do we eventually become one with the plastic?
Dasani sucks. Worst tasting bottled water on the market. 
AKA an extremely small amounts

Out of the 1.08 * 10^28 particles in one liter of water....300 of them are plastic molecules.
I'm so glad I switched to glass water bottles. It does taste better. 
[deleted]
Looks like Mum was right when telling me to not drink Dasani water 10 years ago.
Small pieces of plastic are a good source of fiber, if anything it's better for you than normal water
That's an apropos URL for this story.
WTF does Dasani have a flavor?
Of course I read this as I'm drinking a bottle of Dasani.
So what sources of water don't have plastic pieces? Do the fancy brands like smartwater have them?
I was under the impression all bottled water has *some* plastic in it. This isn't exactly "news" for me.
Fuck, just tell me it isn't in topochico. I can't live without it...
Dasani is locally sourced (tap) water that's been filtered. Chances are there was less plastic before they bottled it. 

No wonder I feel that Dasani does not taste good.
So what is the "best" brand of water bottle to buy or what is a better alternative?
What kind of sizes are we talking here? Smaller than 1 micrometer?
Okay, so what are the long term and short term health effects? Do these just pass through your body?
Is the Kenya Daily Nation a reputable news source? Seriously wondering because I've never heard of it.
It's crazy to think how, in 10-20 years, we'll realize how horrifying and far-reaching the health effects are. Pollution seems to me like generational warfare.
So wait, Jaden Smith was right to invent box water ? Holy shit 
I just continue to fill my stainless steel water bottle with reverse osmosis filtered water ran through a final filter water pitcher I keep in the fridge.  
lovely.. well got to pick up a water purifier..steam distiller..
[deleted]
"Almost as good as free tap water."
That's the secret ingredient.
thats why i strictly drink CRYSTAL GEYSER BABEY YEAH
Coca Cola-Amatil in Australia bottles Mount Franklin drinking water. I suppose that has nanoplastics in it as well.
Bottled water tastes like plastic anyway.
So how does this compare with other plastic-bottled beverages?  Sodas, ice-teas, etc?

Is this a unique problem to water products?  If so, why?
Confirming what we've all been able to taste. 
I guess Euell Gibbons was on to something, only drinking squirrel piss and eating pine nuts.
I find it very odd that I’ve always disliked the taste of Dasani water. I know water doesn’t have a technical taste but there’s something about these water bottles I never liked as opposed to Poland springs or deer park lol. I have a similar issue with the tap water from NJ I live in PA I know this is a different issue tho 
Before anyone raised a brow i hated drinking out of plastic..its a petroleum bi product why would I make a cup out of it? "You're crazy!" They said...then bpa came out..not so crazy. Ingesting small pieces of plastic may or may not be harmful...but I'm going to go with the safe route and say we should drink water with stuff thats been in it for millions and millions of years..not water with stuff in it that humans learned to synthesize with petroleum within the last few centuries.
So the study revealed that 93% of all bottle water contains the--so far--harmless plastic particles, and Coca-Cola said: 

> The firm, however, acknowledged that microplastics “appear to be ubiquitous and therefore may be found at minute levels even in highly treated products”.

And this gets turned into:

> Coca-Cola admits presence of plastic in Dasani water.

What a completely dishonest way to frame that statement.  The use of "admits" implies that it was something the company had previously denied, or had to be cornered regarding.

And limiting the headline to the Dasani brand specifically implies that *only* Dasani contains plastic particles.

And omitting the word "particles" or "microscopic" implies that the plastic is much more prevalent than it actually is.

Such slimy writing.  This kind of shit is one of the many reasons that it's so easy to convince people that every hard truth written by news outlets is "fake news".

In other news, bottled drinks contain bottles!
Why do you think Dasani tastes like plastic? Grossest bottled water I have ever had.
Well it tastes like it...
I don't trust BPA water bottles either. I will be drinking from glass bottles from now on.
So...canned water next?
>To date, there is no evidence that supports that ingesting small pieces of plastic is harmful.

bet people will believe that
[removed]
Can someone clear this up for me: are we not able to filter out the micro plastic using reverse osmosis?
>>world’s famous bottled water products 

Lots of questions - how big are the particles?  Are they harmful? How small do various companies filter for?  Is is practical to filter smaller?
My dad God, isn’t happy about this. Estrogen yummy yum Yums in mug tum tums.
Can someone ELI5 how this shit gets past a graphene filter?
Why the fuck are people still buying bottled water? It's not that hard to get a filter and a reusable bottle.
Always thought Dasani had a plastic taste lol
So if you're bothered by the whole fluoride thing this is really a double slap in the face.
Isn’t it basically just tap water in a bottle?
I knew it tasted like the bottle more so than other brands 
Don't they mean there is water, in their plastic bottles?
I fucking knew that water tasted assly. 
Up until this point they’ve been pretty dasanist. 
Great so the tap is filled with lead and I can't drink bottled water because it's filled with plastic oh joy
Coke brothers are at it again!
I am not surprised. That water be nasty.
I don’t know how this is surprising- Dasani has always had an “you left this thin plastic bottle in direct sunlight for 12 years” taste to it. That’s why I have always refused to drink it.

I’d like to think I astrally projected in to some minds tonight to be like “fuck you I was right about that water, dick,” cuz I’d probably waste that ability for some shit like that.
Haven't they pretty much proven that unfilterable microplastics are in *all* water now? Is this surprising to anyone?
Phew, good thing I only drink coca cola and spirits.

Wait...
Sooo class action lawsuit??
[deleted]
This is why I dump bottled water before use then rinse and refill with water from my tap after going through a 3M Filtrete Under-Sink Advanced Replacement Water Filter (3US-PF01). Yes, I just buy for the bottles which I reuse for many times before recycling.
   Now, perhaps people will go back to drinking regular water...I hope.
   We, the people, via our greed have contaminated most of the planet..it may be time to rethink "convenience".
Am I the only person that preferred the taste of Dasani?
So that is why Dasani somehow tastes like crap even though it is water.
You can taste the plastic or whatever other fucked up toxic shit is dissolved in Dasani.  Same with Aquafina.

The finest of poorly-filtered tap water, with just a hint of oil spill to keep your pallet refreshed.

That helps explain why it tastes like shit compared to virtually every other water brand I've tasted. 
Well they started off selling cocaine sugar water.  So I guess water with some plastic is a little better.  
It’s a sad time when this is not a bigger issue than any other social media issue that happens. Someone says a “no-no” word and all of social media flips out. Chemicals in water and plastic and companies screwing us and killing us... “meh”. 🙄
Dasani is like the devil's anal water anyway.
[deleted]
Attention fellow hipsters. We're well past simple 'bottled water.' What is this, 2005? No, no. Now it's all about the electrolyte infused water that costs 50% more. Personally, I'm a Core water man myself, though I appreciate Essentia or Life Water when I'm feeling frugal.
It is inert and should be too big to pass out of the digestive tract.  So, it is not a big deal.

Wait until you find out how much arsenic is in water.
I'm sorry, and feel free to downvote me to smithereens guys, but... I judge people so hard for drinking bottled water. Come on guys, a Brita  water filter and a reusable water bottle pays for itself in less than a year. Make the change if you haven't already.
Dasani is easily the grossest bottled water brand. Aquafina is just above that. Everything else is just varying degrees of water, but those two are disgusting. 
I'm glad I've been avoiding Dasani then.
Was probably written by nestle to deflect attention.
Why in the world is the clickbait title here about coke rather the **absurd 10,000 per liter** microplastic concentration in Nestle's water? Bad OP is bad. 
I'm guessing Nestle and Coca-cola were called and only one of them took the call and said something besides 'we have no comment at this time.' 
>the main brand of water I buy is a subsidiary of nestle

yay I'm fucked
[deleted]
You're right. At the same tine I can't help but predict people who regularly drink soda don't carry a concern for micro plastics on their health. I personally wouldn't think the plastics would be their first health risk to be concerned with.

Also, water is probably easier to test and cheaper, as well as less of a threat to the industry to publicize. There's water in soda, the result you'd think are comparable if not worse due to properties in soda on the plastic.
If that's true why can't I have kinder eggs
There's probably small pieces of plastic in more things than people realize.
[deleted]
They can't study if it's bad because they haven't been able to find a single person who doesn't have significant amounts of plastic in their blood. 
harmful to their bottomline that is.
Flash back a bit. "To date, there is no evidence that supports that smoking cigarettes is harmful". 
I love how they imply like we should temper our concern because surely those pieces of plastic don't do anything in the body and they all definitely come back out the other end, right?
To date, there is no evidence that shitting out something the size of Godzilla would be harmful.
I work in the plastic industry and that is bullshit 
This kind of tactic has gone on and will go on forever: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchants_of_Doubt


Dasani Water makes me physically hurt.  It makes my Stomach feel like a knot. 
>Is this their new slogan?

Well, "there is no evidence a fuckton of sugar is harmful" ran its course so they were quite in need of a new slogan.
Leave it out for a couple minutes and it's straight up liquid plastic
When a Hurricane is about to hit that is always the last water on the shelf.

It is the powerglove of bottled water.
Nestle is sitting at about 10k a liter...
Yeah I will now prefer tap water.
Dasani is one of the worse tasting brands. I think Poland springs is my favorite 
Aquafina is just as bad.
They spent millions launching Dasani in the UK a decade ago, they found the water was contaminated can't remember the substance. Was taken off the shelf having been launched just a week, so we don't have Dasani here.
I always pick any other brand than Dasani.  I don't know why anyone buys it by choice.
~300 parts per bottle, meanwhile "Samples from Nestle Pure Life brand sourced from the US had the highest concentration at 10,390 plastic pieces a litre. The study revealed that contamination was at least partially coming from the packaging or the bottling process."

Read the full article please. Jesus christ reddit.
If you swirl Dasani and any other brand of bottled water around in their respective bottles, it is obvious how much greater Dasani's surface tension is. I'm pretty sure that's only possible with additives.
[deleted]
Clearly it’s not just tap water... it’s plastic too!
>Dasani, ^^municipal ^^water ^^source*
>
>*It's just tap water.

Tap water with added carcinogens, in the UK: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3809539.stm
It’s not just tap water. Yes, the water is sourced from the municipality, but its stripped of impurities by reverse osmosis and then minerals are added back into the water according to whatever their recipe is. If it was just tap water, there would be no consistency between bottles from different bottling facilities 
You pay for the filtration process. Dasani is filtered with reverse-osmosis.
Petroleum or Plastic?
We need to be careful and not conflate "monomer and plasticizer leaching" with "micro plastic particle contamination".   Two very different things.   The former has been shown to potentially cause health problems (like the BPA scare flare of the last couple decades), while the latter hasn't (yet).
At least it wasn’t Nestle.
There have been no studies that support the notion that pieces of plastic as small as the ones found in their water put are health at risk. Heck, there are probably similar amounts in plenty other things that we eat
There are microplastics in tap water everywhere.  If you're not filtering your water then you're already drinking it. 
You would need evidence health was being put at risk
To be fair, Coke didn't add Benzene, they added another chemical that broke down into Benzene when exposed to UV.  Still harmful, but not openly malicious.
That doesn't necessarily mean it's because of the plastic bottle. Not all bottles are made equal -- the soft plastic degrades faster and will end up in your water, but the harder plastic ones will not. 

Tap water is subject to rigorous control due to it being a public resource and checked by the government (depending on country/city). The checks are frequent, whereas bottled water will be bottled and then depending on how it's stored, temperature etc, there are no further tests as to its quality. Leave cheap ass plastic bottles in the sun for a long time and you're drinking the bottle along with your water, for instance. No one's goign around making sure the water bottled 5 years ago is good to drink.
Glass bottles for all. Wash bottles, then reuse. Planet saved. Plastic is the devil. 
If you read the whole article they mention that Nestle has about 10k pieces of plastic per liter compared to Dasani's ~350. The fact that they single out Dasani in the title is ridiculous
Not confusing if you read the article instead of just looking at the picture.
You're gonna get microplastic in your body no matter what, even if you hike out innawoods and live in a log cabin.
Salt mined from under the great planes states here in the US should be plastic free, unless it was introduced in packaging. *sea salt* on the other hand... yeah good luck on that one. 
The plastic is the proprietary ingredient that makes it different from the municipal source.
What if I am going out and don’t want to lug a bottle with me when I’m done?
I've known people like that. Never understood that sort of behavior. Like, either buy 1 gallon or 5 gallon jugs if the tap water's bad enough that you can't drink it. Or a filter. 

Even if that wasn't bad for the environment it's way more expensive.
woh! I didn't see that coming.
Life in plastic

It's fantastic
No, it's 300 pieces of plastic, not 300 molecules.
A lot of the plastic was likely in the water before it was bottled. Tap water has plastic in it too.
Hmm! Good for a Gym Buff
I'm on a similar wavelength as you. I trust that our digestive systems have evolved well enough to be able to handle this. If it can't absorb it, just pass it through. This ain't it's first rodeo.
I think this brand came out first (at least contemporary wise): https://boxedwaterisbetter.com/

I think Jaden's Just Water uses aluminum inside the container. The cap is pretty innovative though (I mean, in for the current market, not that it's new). 
.ke is for Kenya. .co is equivalent to .com.
I was drinking out of a glow in the dark nalgene for a while. I agree with your sentiment and have also made the switch to glass. Just in case.
Yes. You can distill the water and use a nonplastic bottle.
For real, like what happens next. This shits absurd 
It's the salt.
Dasani ain't bad compared to nestle.. read it
What is "regular" water? 

At this point in history, I would hazard a guess that micro bits of plastic are in pretty much everything. 
It's my favorite. /Shrug
It’s my favorite after Sam’s.  
  
I tried Voss once, it tasted like it came from a water fountain or something, really poor.
If you read the article, Nestle is in its own league (in a bad way), Dasani has around an average amount compared to most brands, while Nestle had >25x as much.
The magnesium sulfate in their (and a few others') bottled water gives me massive headaches. I was getting 2-3 debilitating headaches a week until I stumbled across an article purporting that magnesium sulfate could cause this in some people. I stopped drinking Dasani about 5 years ago and haven't had anything more than a simple run of the mill headache since.
> It has fucking ingredients!

So does tap water.  They add sodium for taste because without it the water would taste acidic and sodium is necessary for bodily functions which is why we don't drink distilled water.   Tap water has about twice as much sodium in it as bottled.

lol what do you think water is? but water with a variety of minerals in it. 
So you only drink unnatural distilled water?
Lol core is fantastic.

I live in an area with significant chromium 6 runoff so I had to get an aqua gear water filter and stock up on bottled water. Needlessly expensive for something the city should be doing with all the damn taxes I pay. Unreal. 

The city is trying to argue that just because chromium 6 levels are high, it doesn’t mean the concentration is dangerous necessarily - without providing any proof of their claim. Just nuts.
Dasani = Aquafina
Coke is no saint, and people accuse them of horrible things, like hiring paid goons to brutally assassinate union leaders, but absolutely FUCK Nestle.

Nestle went into poor African nations with Vendors disguised as nurses. These vendors told mothers to give their children Nestle formula instead of breast-milk and the vendors gave the first bit of formula for free. 

The women stopped producing breast milk, as their bodies thought they didn't need it anymore. Then Nestle jacked up the price on the formula, so now the women couldn't afford it.  

Consequently, their children starved to death, or died of malnutrition when the mothers tried to dilute the formula with water to save money.

Absolutely despicable, causing the slow, horrible, torturously painful death of infants for what? The market for baby formula in dirt poor African  countries? ( edit: apparently it was not just countries in Africa, it happened in Jamaica and other third world countries tooĺ


No Market would be worth human lives like that, but the fact that these were such tiny and poor markets shows just how depraved and callous they were, and how little regard for human life they held.

But the photo is of nestle. 
Also the air contained at the top of a bottle of Nestle water has an alarming amount of nitrogen in it. Almost 80%! It's almost nothing but nitrogen which is the number one killer industrial inert gas.
These tiny microplastic fibers seem to come from the air
It's in tap water too though, so unless we figure out a solution, we really better hope the 'ingesting small particles of plastic' is true.

I wonder what filtration process would take out these particles.
Yeah, makes sense. As a side question, do current filters products(britta, etc) remove microplastics at all?
Small is subjective.  
I've been seeing ads for kinder eggs in the states. Did something change

Presents a choking hazard I guess. 
This is correct.  
  
The oft quoted estimate of microplastic pieces in the ocean seems to be ridiculously low 5 trillion. The real number may be something on the order of a million times more. Check out this article from the [2016 EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/fish-news-sept2016.pdf) (ah the good ole days) that sources another study "The Baltic Sea carries about 25 to 40 plastic particles per gallon of water—or 229 quadrillion pieces across its entire volume." Not that microplastics are evenly distributed, but given that, 5 trillion seems to be a hilariously low estimate. 
  
Heck, if you calculate just the number of plastic microfibers we are releasing into our greywater in United States each year from just our polyester/elastic laundry, even conservatively, that is 350,000 microfibers per wash load * 100 wash loads a year * 120,000,000 households = 4,200,000,000,000,000. Even optimistically saying water treatment filters 90% of those out, that's quadrillions of microfibers going into the waterways each year worldwide for non-industrial wash alone.  
  
And it's not necessarily just about our health, but about impacts to sea life as well. So, in this instance, it's not mass that matters, but number of particles and variation in size. We are basically injecting quadrillions or more per annum of small, non biodegradable and mostly non nutritive pieces of petroleum product into an environment where all of the biological processes of many sea creatures happens (feeding/spawning/asexual reproduction) in addition to the water we drink.  
  
And yet, at the end of the day, micro-plastic pollution rates relatively low on the scale of the catastrophic problems facing the world's water.
Like my innards.
And it's harmful. The ocean and great lakes are chock full of them and it is harming wildlife. Microfibers from clothes, fucking microbeads, you name it. It's all in there. We're all drinking it. Microbeads have been banned in most places, Canada is supposed to have them out completely by 2019 or something.
They weren't wrong.  The problem isn't the ingestion, but the environmental effects...which are causing the problem that these water companies are dealing with here.

The difference is that Coke filters out the vast majority of the plastic, while the toothpaste companies were putting it in the product intentionally.
Jesus fucking Christ that's horrifying.
Also "There's no evidence that belting out shitloads of greenhouse gases is going to screw us over eventually!"
The same PR companies used to spit out these lines are now being paid to produce "evidence" that climate change is either not real or else something happening on its own with no significant impact by humans.
SO MUCH THIS!  Sorry for my outburst but I get SO frustrated when people spit this shit! I’m not waiting for evidence that it’s harmful, I’ll use fucking logic thanks! 
Never tried a bottled water that didn't taste like that. Almost found it strange that people can drink that aside from emergencies. 
Because it’s so rad?
Just buy reverse osmosis water. 
Dasani is tap water though. 
Tap water isn't any better. The same microplastics are in 94% of tap water in the US.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals
Depending on where you are, the bottled stuff is still your best bet.
There is microplastics in tap water too. It's in all water, even the air from clothes dryers exhaust. It's interesting and worrying, but really a non issue at these low levels.
\+ Pur filter
Personally I dislike Arrowhead more, tastes like backwash.
> Dasani is one of the worse tasting brands. I think Poland springs is my favorite

Same here. I'll take Nestle PureLife or the Kirkland brand bottled water over Dasani. But Poland Springs is crisp and fresh tasting - not to mention Poland Spring™ is bottled in Poland, Maine, and one of its water sources is the Poland Spring near Poland, Maine lol 

Edit: https://www.polandspring.com/our-story

Also, preemptive hi /r/hailcorporate! Nestle, that'll be $40k, pay up bitches!
Their flavored sparkling water is pretty damn good! And yes, better than la croix for certain flavors imo.
I'm pretty sensitive to the taste of water. I can't tolerate Dasani. As shitty as Nestle is they make a lot of non-offensive tasting brands. If you can find it in your area chippewa spring water is a very good non-nestle brand. 

I can't drink Aquafina, I end up gagging and throwing up.  Shit is nasty.
yeah i thought that aquafina was even worse than dasani
Aquafina is actually the worst brand of bottled water in terms of taste
The sodium makes it delicious?
The shape of the bottle would also affect this.


Bottled water is just silly.  Paying a ridiculous premium for something that you can get for free from just about anywhere.  Take a reusable water bottle and fill it up to save money and save the environment from the plastics and shipping impacts.
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals
> If it was just tap water, there would be no consistency between bottles from different bottling facilities 

Sadly, in the case of Dasani and Aquafina the result is that it consistently tastes like shit. 
Thank you Coca Cola marketing department.  It's still a waste of money and resources to bottle tap water, ship it, and then either throw away or recycle a single-use plastic container.
Either one works, honestly.
It appears that way for the moment, but there are are effects of micro plastics lower down on the [food chain](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b00183) and there are issues with micro [plastic accumulation in certain organs](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46687).  it not a non-issue.
I'm reminded of fake seeds in preserves made out of "cellulose" aka wood fiber, melamine in baby formula, milk, etc ..
Increases estrogen.
I thought that the benzene was as a result of contamination from the plant.  I had no idea they actually deliberately added it but where too stupid to know what they were doing. You'd think that they might have a few chemists working for them. 
I once helped with a study on movement of pyrogenic carbon (forest fire-carbon) through soil and water. This had us taking water and soil samples in North Central New Mexico.

We had glass bottles and some Nalgene sample bottles which are supposed to be low-leaching. Since we'd be hiking up in the forest, obviously it was more convenient to use the plastic bottles for samples which wouldn't break and were lighter.

So we did a little test. Collected six samples of lake water on campus, and tossed them in the dark, cold, chem lab fridge over the weekend. 3 days in a minimally reactive environment.

Then we put the samples through a carbon combustion analyzer. The samples from Nalgene had consistently 20x as much carbon present as the glass-stored samples, enough to completely obscure the amount of carbon naturally present in the water.

Plastic leaches, period.
That brings up a good question.  Water bottles (packs) have expiration dates on them.  What exactly is the purpose for those dates?  is it dangerous to drink beyond the expiration because of the plastic?  Always wondered.
Then how else will the plastic get in the water?
If by ridiculous you mean “a good hint this fluff piece was written by Nestle’s PR team”... then yeah, I’m with you.
Throw the stainless steel bottle away.
I'm only talking about these particular brands and the fact that users are paying for tap water.  

As a completely separate issue, there are plenty of good spring waters out there.  And some of them even come in disposable glass bottles, if you give a tinker's damn about the spherical prison we're all forced to share.  The old axiom is "You don't shit where you eat."  So please recycle.
His car had a million empty water bottles, must be more out there like him
Come on Barbie
Ohhh. That's unfortunate
The said about half as much was in tap water
I mean I don't trust the tap water either, but it's evident that from the study that just came out, the bottling process introduces more plastic. 

Man, I feel like society is in a sad state overall. Can't trust tap water, bottle water, shit some places in the US only have toxic water and still nothing is being done about it. Kids afraid to go to school and get shot up. Bridges collapsing, whole cities getting swept underwater by storms, a divided society, a manic President. Going to school is outrageously expensive, fake news every where, everyone gets offended so easily, social media is the worst thing to happen to society.

Seriously, I don't even know how it got this bad. I wish I knew how to make things better because the future looks grim.
Probably nothing if damages can't be shown.
*Their wrists are going to get soooo red!*
>I would hazard a guess that micro bits of plastic are in pretty much everything. 

They are. But, tap water is reported to have half as much of it than bottled water. The problem with bottled water is the water is in a plastic bottle. Opening/closing it creates more microplastics. 

The problem with microplastics is that some of the pieces are small enough to enter the bloodstream and therefore the organs. That means it's not just passed through your digestive system. It's entering your bloodstream and eventually is deposited somewhere it's never going to come out of. See the problem? And you can be sure it's cumulative. 

The more present and biggest issue is filtering plastics out of the water. It's going to increase the cost of water if we find we need to do this as a society....chances are because of the costs involved we're not going to have definitive science on it for decades if ever. 
oh my god it all makes sense

even if they're the same I still think Dasani is somehow slightly more gross, though. I can't really offer an explanation. 
There were also issues when dirty local water supplies were used to mix the formula iirc. In a just world, Nestle would have been sued into bankruptcy and had many executives and employees imprisoned. 
Iirc, Nestle's CEO has gone on record where he wants to remove water as a basic human right.
Nestle is absolute scum. But fuck Coke too. Fuck them all 
I remember learning about this a few years ago, glad to see a link. My hubby doesn’t understand why I refuse to drink their water or eat anything Nestle. I’m not about to support that brand not too mention put that shit in my body! It makes me so frustrated, sad and angry that these things happen 😣
They also seem to have a thing for sourcing bottled water from deserts.

You do realize what we think of Coke is not one company right? 

So the Coca Cola company makes the syrup and beverage bases to make the drinks. 

They then sells those to bottling companies that make and bottle the drinks. They are also responsible for marketing and distribution.

Most scientists seem to agree that their source is fabric.
I'm betting distillation would do the trick, but it's pretty cost and time intensive and furthermore, the mineral content would then have to adjusted. 
I'm assuming reverse osmosis filters would clean it out. Just a guess though. 
My city water actually gives me a stomach ache to drink. So I drink bottled water. At least I can stand to drink my 8 thousand recommended  ounces  a day. 
I believe it has to be a a carbon block filter, which I think is what brittas usually are. You'd think a good follow up study is proving if these small, affordable water filters work.
Yeah, I've been looking at getting a berkey filter and i'm curious as well. The berkey filters down to 2 microns, which is smaller than these plastics... but I dunno. They say they haven't done testing for microplastics yet on their site. 
Would you mind telling that to my girlfriend :( 
What you've been seeing is probably Kinder Joy. Similar but not the same. Its an egg shaped chocolate where one half is a toy and the other half is cream with wafers. We dont get the cool capsules or the hollow milk chocolate with white chocolate inside

Kinder Joy is not the same
Everything is harmful in excess. For example, too much water will kill you. The question is not whether something is harmful, it is how much can one consume before it becomes harmful.
It's horrifying and true.  They test the blood as much as possible when they discover new people in jungle anywhere and they've all had plastic so far
What do you drink from?
Ya, tap water with plastic.
Depending on where you live, tap water has more rigorous and more frequent checks and tests than bottled water. 
No! Plastic flavoured tap water 
yep run through a reverse osmosis filter.

We're all doomed
Then if I’m going to drink plastic I might as well drink plastic for free 
What about if you pass it through a Britta filter? Does that make a difference?

Asking because I'm hoping.
Food isn't going to be any better. Plants absorb plastics, and it stands to reason that would contaminate most of our produce. This pollution affects every waterway and ocean connected to human activity, and some are saying all bodies of water since the particles are small enough to be carried by wind. Give it a bit of time and we'll be seeing articles about fruits and vegetables testing positive for micro plastics.
Orlando's sulfur water is dreadful. I've spent the past week here and brushing my teeth has made my skin crawl. I always knew Disney's water was awful, but didn't know it was a region-wide problem. 
Let’s revisit this topic in 25 years and see if this holds true.
The thing that scares me is that the stuff will never break down. So it will only become more concentrated.

But I like keeping a case of it in my trunk. The sharability is quite convenient for road trips, or for when I'm at a specific place for 7-8 hours and don't want to bring my water bottle into the bathroom to fill it.
Tap water is disgusting. I prefer bottled water.
It's RO water. Some people like the taste of RO water 
I agree that it’s wasteful, and I generally wouldn’t ever spend money on bottled water. I just wanted to point out that it isn’t the same as the municipal water
It's also not necessarily an issue that you can really sue them over.  What is their percentage compared to tap, other brands, other ways of getting purified water, etc.? The plastic is in our environment, is it in the water because getting a 100% pure liquid is incredibly expensive, or is it in the water because of neglect by Coke?
It's almost like we have to learn this shit as we go along through history.
Sounds like a good thing y'all tested the bottles out before use
It is practically impossible to store pure water. It dissolves just about everything known to man, in addition life on earth exists just about everywhere on the surface of earth, including in ultra pure water that has recently dissolved everything it has ever come in contact with since coming out of the filter.

Even lab grade 'ultra pure water 99.9999%+ pure' has issues with stuff growing in it, current theory is the water absorbs salts/etc from the breath of the lab workers and algae spores manage to make their way in. 

So basically you are guaranteed your '99.9%' bottled water has enough contamination to support life and that life will grow, along with dissolving the bottle its stored in. 

Any spores/etc that come in contact with that water have literally nothing better to do then find a way to survive and multiply in it. 
The expiration date is to get you to buy more water bottles.  Nothing more.
I dunno but I've definitely drank some old bottled water that tasted disgusting, like it was out of a garden hose.
China and India got our backs. 
I mean, I'm not perfect by any means. I drink beer out of aluminum cans that I do recycle. But still I wish it were easier to have jugs refilled with beer than it is. I'm not excusing my behavior or anything, but it's not like I have a tap in my house that has pabst blue ribbon coming out of it.
lets go party
Yeah, if there are no harmful affects towards ingestion, it's pretty difficult to sue them here.
Cancer?? With an insane number of people getting cancer i feel it shows for its self... Is there data showing number of people who have been diagnosed with cancer per capita? Curious if theres a spike after water bottles hit the market....
> The problem with microplastics is that some of the pieces are small enough to enter the bloodstream and therefore the organs.

That's not true.  You're referring to nanoplastics which we can't do anything about at this point but sit back and hope they don't kill us. 
Sueing them wouldn't really do anything. They get sued all the time. Their legal fees are worth it to them because their profits afford them the ability to just neglect responsibility. 
Take their stock. Much more effective
Yep. Nestle is literally the worst company to support in terms of beverage consumption. 
It's not that he thinks people shouldn't have water.  He was making a bog-standard 'tragedy of the commons' argument.
That's not what he said.

He actually made a lot of sense in saying that people in the West feel entitled to use water cheaply as much as they want—leaving the shower running while they put the coffee pot on, running sprinklers when they don't need to, taking long luxurious showers—while still expecting to always have enough clean fresh water to drink.

He was just being very frank about the fact that it may behoove us (and the suppliers' wallets, of course) to start treating *excess* water use as more of a luxury.
Are you fucking kidding me? He really asked for that? What kind of human being do you have to be to say "If you want to drink in order to survive, you *absolutely must* pay"?
That’s why they think they can take from the Great Lakes for free? 

I think there is a documentary called “blue gold”. 
This is actually misleading. Fuck nestle, etc, but his comment was in the context of saying that his company shouldn't be allowed to harvest water for free and that a cost associated with reseources like water woulld allow governments to charge companies like Nestle
how is this person still breathing?

Because desparete people buy as much as they can. Even when it isn't enough. Further it's no all or nothing. Jacking up prices to something where only 75% can afford could be more profitable then jacking up to a price wehere still 100% can afford.

Ferrari format want to serve all people with a driving license, Nestle neither, however without a Ferrari you have other options. When you're depend on nestle you die.

Can I sell my account, all my comments about Nestle are positive.
Point me in the right direction.
I know. Pretty spooky. These bottles also contain another chemical with a name just as big and scary as "microplastics". It's called dihydrogen monoxide or DHMO! Both Nestle and Coke are selling bottles full of this dangerous stuff to kids. As for the source, the Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen and about 20% oxygen. 
Water would almost NEVER be shipped in a refrigerated unit. To justify the extra cost there needs to be a threat of spoiling without climate control... a trailer full of bottled water would just go in a dry van, no refrigerating.
Yup, never drink from a water bottle left in a hot car, even after you cool it down. 
Then, we'll bottle the distilled water in plastic bottles, for easy distribution.

They at least went the extra petroleum.
Until there is a boil advisory and you hear about it 2 weeks late. 
Which doesn’t filter out plastics is seems. Plastics are in tap water and in bottle water because no one is filtering it out. 
Which is made of plastic.
You're assuming that micro plastics are more harmful to your health than anything that can be found in your hundred-year old pipes and wells.
Good point. I worded the original post poorly.
People are saying reverse osmosis filters aren't enough to get all of it, which would mean it's pretty damn small at the smallest extreme. I haven't verified this, but if it's true, and I see no reason it wouldn't be, then your Brita won't do anything for it. It doesn't have nearly the filtration capability of a reverse osmosis filter. A Brita is good (subjectively) for improving the taste of well water in some places, but I wouldn't rely on it for any kind of health benefits.
It makes a difference for sure, but there's probably still some plastic in it. I think they filter down to .2 microns?
This is because the entire region is a swamp. You're drinking filtered swamp water. It takes extra chemicals to make it drinkable that you don't need to add to other water from better sources.
Personally, I think the poor water quality (along with the excessive humidity) is a large part of why we see so many crazy stories out of Florida.
> Plus, isn’t Nestle the company that goes into communities, drains their water supply, then leaves?

Yes they are. Unfortunately, very few bottled water companies haven't fallen to the Nestle Corporate Machine. Poland Spring was bought out by Nestle a few decades ago. 

To be clear - Nestle is a horrible company, but Poland Spring water is still my go-to if I have to drink a bottled water. 
Once you start carrying a water bottle, it's natural to take it on your unexpected day trip.  Most bottled water is consumed in developed nations.
You can get water bottles that have filters. They’re pricier but they’re handy depending on where you’re traveling if you think the water may not be quality. 
Isn't the heated & cooled cycle of the plastic bottles (since in the trunk) part of how plastic particles get in the water? So are you drinking more particles? 
Convenience > environment.
Evian spelled backwards is....

Naive


*spit take*

That's it.  I'm never drinking water again.
I'm not proud...but as a kid I kinda liked that taste. Especially warm.

I'm not joking.
They sell by the gallon here in AZ, they need to make a better size keg and deliver that shit. Rent out the kegerator too
I’m sure that are within acceptable FDA limits. 
At best that would be correlation
You missed the "into bankruptcy" part. 
I had no clue about any of this....that's not right.

I will now no longer purchase Nestle water battles, thanks for the info redditors.

Oh fuck off. The average consumer waste of water, even if I let my shower run 24/7/365 is but an evaporated molecule of water in an ocean of waste by his and other companies.

Absolutely, comrade 
If you use the DHMO to get the nitrogen wet, you get liquid nitrogen, which is pretty dangerous.
Why? What if don’t have any water left and I’m in the desert?
I'm sitting here reading this threads wondering what percentage of previously hot bottled water is sold to us here in the UAE. 90%? Jesus. Time to read up on what micro plastics are doing to my body.
Okay so source or any suggestions?
We'll tell her together..  

As usual
Ha jokes on you! I do tongue ups while redditing
Exactly! I guess Kinder Disappointment wouldn't have sold as well
That's a really good question 
Cool. I guess I wanted to know more about where you get your water from?
Well it does have electrolytes (added salts).

Yup, they might be able to do a bit better with our drinking water by developing technologies to capture these particles. I read that nanotech is good for straining water, hopefully someone is on top of that.
Uhhh, i dont know about tap water(well when i think about it, pvc piping), but wouldnt the plastic from a water bottle leech into the water over time, how would you filter something like that? Thats why you shouldn't leave plastic bottles in sunlight, or extreme cold/heat, as the energy absorbed during this process will break down a very fine layer of molecules everytime it happens.(thats why plastic chairs and tables become brittle after being assaulted by the sun for years and years) I assume its why bottled water really has a expiration date also. 
Before you get all new agey and homeopathic, consider the sunshine and FOIA laws unique to Florida.
If you can find it try chippewa spring water. Tastes as good as Nestle with none of the guilt. 
Poland Spring isn't even filtered.
Mmm, brass ions.
The problem is  that the legal fees they endure aren't enough to discourage profits. I still say leverage their stock though. If a company does well after exploiting people then their wealth with contribute to society in a more direct way

Nestle makes all kinds of products so if you want to avoid them altogether you should look up what companies they represent. Nah it's not impossible to avoid them, but it's good to know what they own so you don't accidentally buy their stuff. Plastic in their water, maybe there's lead in their chocolate. I can't trust 'em.
Whoooo boy, better get ready to buy s lot less of all products.   
Nestle makes  as it turns out, just about everything.  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestlé_brands
Begun, these water battles have.
They are indeed vile... I also had no idea. But here's a list of all of their brands... over 8500.... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestlé_brands
This is just the tip of the iceberg. 007: quantam of solace is based on Nestle stealing water in poor countries and selling it back for a 1000% markup.
No. I'm not qualified to make that determination.
Well that's what he said.

So why should I fuck off?
Then one bottle isn't enough to save you.
Use canteens, fam. Yeti makes great ones and many other cheap alternatives with Bpa free ingredients.

Have multiple in your car and office. 
Zero water filters much more and includes a testing devuce. But it's a  but more expensive as you have to replace the filters more often. I really wish the filtration was done before distribution as it's a waste to throw away little plastic filters all the time...
Username unsurprisingly relevant. Nice one
Kinda like how McDonald's doesn't call them Sad Meals.
Tap + Pur filters. 
It does? I thought it was just the waste water from bottling coke?
Most filters (except the carbon brita type) filter out plastic particles in this range.  They must be using a really crappy filter at their plant. 
[deleted]
These plastics aren't necessarily coming from the pipes or bottles. I know micro plastic is common in things like clothing and detergents and is polluting water sources via old laundry water also. This is a legit pollution problem not just a problem with packaging.
> If you can find it try chippewa spring water. Tastes as good as Nestle with none of the guilt.

Will do! 
I will do that. I don't think I purchase too many Nestle products but I will for sure check. The water is good but fuck those people. 
Luckily they always slap their stupid logo on it, so it's easy to locate the Nestle products.
Yeah right after I posted I went and looked at that page.....
Zephryhills, Ozarka, Deer  Park, and Ice Mountain are all Nestle products?! I must be full of plastic
Hello there!
Then who is, because I guarantee you if my "luxurious" shower is considered waste then the corporations are going to be going over in .01 seconds, probably less.

Edit: By the way, I pay a water bill every month so I don't know how any of the water I paid for is excess...
*You’re* the one who said he makes sense. 
You realize that even if something is insoluble in water, it doesn't mean you can't accidentally drink it right?

> The water is good

It's water. It's not like nestle has some special recipe. 
No, they don't.  They own many of the regional bottled water companies, and they don't always have a Nestle logo, or with some, they're very small on the back.
General Kenobi!
First off, this is about excessive use of water, so your water bill isn't relevant in determining what is excess.

And I imagine an honest determination of excess use would be dependent on the situation and need. This would differ from household to household and from company to company.
Because it still makes sense.

His companies may be more wasteful, but that doesn't mean everybody else *isn't*. That's pure whataboutism.
  I will happily continue to not buy any of those products, but Mutha fuckin Hot Pockets, I like those shitty things from time to time.  Damn now I am going to have to find a more expensive shittier hippy version of them.
[deleted]
That's not all of them with regards to this subject.

Nestle owns a number of smaller, regional water brands, including Arrowhead, Calistoga, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Poland Spring, and Zephyrhills.

Much of the water in stores is their's it's really shitty.
Huah.. today I learned I haven't purchased a Nestle product in years.

Sugar ain't my friend so that's a lot of their products gone.
I'm happy and proud to report that I use absolutely none of the products on that list. 0 changes necessary for a family of 5. Nice.
noooo sometimes a kit kat is the only good thing to happen to me all week :(
Different brands taste different and have different processes of filtration and distribution.....nice try though. 
He is a bold one
No, it still doesn’t. 


Take a guess on what percentage civilian use of water accounts for. 

Take a guess. 
They used to sell it in glass bottles.  Maybe we should return to that method.  
Honestly, that's not nearly as much as I thought.
3 million tons of plastic for a product that does not need to exist.  Of course we’d live longer - so there’s a trade off 

Edit: Tonnes... so 10% more.
Revealing these numbers is a great first step towards reducing these numbers
The solution here is pretty simple.  Bottle deposit laws, in every state, for every type of beverage.  Michigan has a 90% bottle return rate thanks to our 10 cent deposit law and you never see cans or bottles littering the side of the highway.
Now I'm curious, is this Global usage?

And is it only specificly Coca-Cola branded (coke, diet Coke, etc) products or all products owned by the Coca-Cola company?
Damn. 15000 blue whales worth of plastic a year. I don't even think I can wrap my head around that. 
The funny thing is the way the beverage market is now with healthier and organic options. if they switched back to glass and encorporated cane sugar in more of their products as a healthier option to high fructose corn syrup they would probably do pretty well 
Will that increase or decrease oil consumption?

I think it will increase it.

What about the cans?
Unfortunately glass isn’t as cost effective to recycle from what I’ve read. 
they still do sell, but it cant be easily mass produced, and recycled easily like plastic can.
How much you thought?

OMG!  I just don't know a better toilet bowl cleaner, let alone any other readily available consumer product that can dissolve a cup full of extracted teeth overnight. 

EDIT: I'm not sure if the avalanche of downvotes is because readers here don't realize these are legitimate, widely-adopted uses for Coca Cola, or if readers here don't want to be remimded of them.  Personally, I've always found it amazing that it can dissolve teeth better than nitric acid, while cleaning a toilet bowl without etching the ceramic, like nitric acid likely would.  All in a $0.10 bottle at the local general store (my pricing might be dated).
There used to be bottling plants for Coke in most cities, it wasn't bottled in a few locations then shipped.

Also meant more jobs for locals
Not sure about the figures.  Glass weighs more, so uses more fuel to transport.  On the other hand plastic is made from oil.
What about them?
That's why you reuse them as long as possible.
It’s 100% recyclable, though.  They used to reuse them a few times first.
Went to plastic because they weigh less and cheaper to transport.
Create Coke machines that refill glass bottles when you bring them. The loss from not charging for the container is made up for in the lowered cost to make bottles.
They didn't recycle them. You'd take the bottle back to the store. The coke driver picked them up, and took them back to the factory, where they were cleaned and refilled. 
I don't know why you're getting down voted. You're absolutely correct. 

Glass has two glaring issues related to recycling. 

First, bottles aren't sorted by color at the curb and so all the colors get mixed, breakage happens and the accepting facility isn't going to separate all that. Once the colors are mixed, they're not getting unmixed and bottle producers won't accept mixed color recycled glass. Glass color is important because it's functional, the color blocking certain wavelengths that would otherwise degrade the product. 

Second, it's literally cheaper to source the sand that glass is made from than to recycle glass, even if the recycled glass was properly sorted by color. 


Beer bottles are mass produced.

I take it you don't drink much beer. 
Well, yes and no. "Tonnes" is the British spelling. And being the UK, it refers to a metric ton (around 2400 lbs). "Tons" is American English, and so it generally refers to the 2000 lb imperial ton. Each spelling can refer to the other, but it's usually specified (imperial/metric). 
False equivalence, but whatever ...
Yes, but consumers have allowed them to by making a useless (to harmful) product a household necessity.  
Mountain Dew. 
[deleted]
Just buy some acid.

That is just the acid working.
Don't forget breakage. 
Cans are more cost-efficient to recycle than glass or plastic

Why not just buy one's fizzy water in cans instead of bottles?
I used to save glass for recycling but it became kind of impossible to deal with due to weight and space.
its probably more expensive to recycle glass, you need to melt down the glass and reform it into whatever shape, and all those processes that come along with it.
I'm sure in the world we live in someone would never try to refill a dirty bacteria infested toxin laden bottle to save a few cents. Or would never sue someone like Coca-Cola because they cut their self from a chip on the lip of the bottle or complain that there were glass particles in that chipped bottle.

Has this fully fallen out of fashion? I’ve never seen it done in my lifetime, but I also may have been an area that doesn’t. 
I didn’t know that about the colors! 
And Snapple.
They're both moral arguments. They're equivalent if the issue is viewed through the prismed glasses of morality.

Your statement that soft drinks are not needed to exist can be just as easily applied to Reddit. 

Just like we don't need meat to survive.

Or soy to be vegetarian. 

Or pets to be loved. 

Or skydiving to be brave. 

Or more than one child to be fulfilled. 

Or you to be preached too.....

But here you are. 
No, it’s all the corporations fault for making my buy their product every day 
I was not aware that Mountain Dew also did these things so well.  More science fun to be had!
Nah, it's just for fun.
IIRC, it takes nitric acid, or stronger, to dissolve teeth with anything close to equivalent efficiency, if at all.  Those same acids will almost certainly strip the smooth finish off the ceramic, inside the bowl - that I've seen before. 
Breakage is no more common than with wine bottles.
Personally, I prefer the taste of beverages from glass containers.  I’ve never seen beer being served at restaurant in cans.  Probably for a reason.
Then, bring it to your transfer station more often.  
Umm... You do realize you don't just shred plastic and stick it in a mold, right? Also, in heating plastic, a bit is burned off. 
So you aren’t sure.
So is smoking, and if you believe California,  literally everything. 
Yeah. They stopped like, back in the 70s, when plastic bottles really picked up. 
There goes the anti soda argument.
They've certainly spent billions on manipulating you into buying it.   

They've been caught several times lying to consumers and misleading them when it comes to the health risks and benefits of their products. They've explicitly targeted children with many of these lies. Ultimately people are responsible for buying coke products but those same consumers *are* influenced by the advertising and lies they've been fed since they were infants.  
Yeah man, brominated vegetable oil in mt dew is so nasty it’s banned in Europe. 
Well the first generation of coke drinkers were being drugged by them so customers definitely needed their fix
They just need to buy jack Daniels to complete the merger of happiness.
"Guys! Guys! I got an idea...Coca-Cola but we put rum in it.....We call it a Rum & Coke!!"

"Promote this man!!"
Surprised it's not just coke and sake in a can! When I was there they had machines that mixed the two for you if you pressed the middle of the three buttons on the machine. Come to think if it, in America no one lets you serve yourself but in Japan you can be a 16 year old white kid and have access to infinite alcohol apparently.. lol
What an opportunity to call it Colahol
Hmm, did not know this was a thing. Guess I'll pick one up tomorrow afternoon to try.
In Japan is very common for a beverage brand to produce all kind of drinks, from baby formula to beer without taboos.

How do they get the alcohol percentage wrong in the article when you can see the amount for each can in the picture posted for the article? It's 3% to 7%.
Damn; I was just at the liquor store yesterday; I would have picked one up to try, but...

>the drinks are modelled on the country's popular Chu-Hi drinks, usually a mix of local spirit and a range of fruit flavours. 

...I cannot imagine they have done anything new with the genre. Seriously, half of the liquor store is comprised of chu-hi from Japanese beverage companies, and some of them are very good. There is a wide range of sweetness, juice types, alcohol contents, diet versions... I mean... Coke is so fucking late to this show that I don't know why they are showing up. There have to be 30+ other products already on the market.

>proving especially popular with female drinkers

Yes and no... A lot of Japanese women don't drink at all. I think these things are *aimed* at women, but I still see mostly men buying them. The less sweet ones are really nice in the summer.

Also, this is completely ignoring what a chu-hi *really* is: It's a cocktail made of shochu (usually barley), some flavoring, and soda. If you order one at an izakaya, a lot of times what will come to the table is a big glass mug with ice, shochu, and soda in it, and half a grapefruit or lemon or whatever and a juicer. Then you squeeze your own juice and add it to the mug to taste. Again, lovely in the sticky Japanese summer, and again, more of a guy drink.

Women drinkers are much more likely to either swill draught beer (ice cold with a creamy head—don't be a fucking foreign tool and send it back; *it's supposed to be there; the tap actually makes the foam to lay on top of the beer; just fucking enjoy it and stop acting like they're trying to get away with something, you Aussie cunt!*), or sip "plum wine" (really it's plum-infused shochu). 

Anyway, point of the story: I don't see how the market can possibly accommodate another lemon chu-hi, FFS.

UPDATE: Looked around this evening after work to buy some. Couldn't find any.
Coca-Cola is already known in Balkans countries as an important ingredient of the alcoholic beverage we call "The Bamboo". 30% red wine + 70 % Coke. Together it really gives a flavor. It is known in many countries, and they have different names for this mixture, some like it more strong, some less strong, but generally, it is considered a good winter drink. OK, 30-70 is just for a beginner.

Coke going alcoholic is no surprise, their basic product was there for many decades already.
Did anyone else immediately think of the Nuka Cola Corporation from Fallout and their wide variety of refreshing beverages?
NukaCola Dark anyone?
Their commercials before movies are so cringy. They use corrupt gov't in poor countries to suck them dry of all drinkable water and then put ads in theaters acting like they are saving the world. Awful company
Aw, its just hard lemonade, I was hoping it was something cola based. 
NukaCola Wild. Another Fallout prediction comes true.
This makes me miss Strong Zero, what I would give to have that in Australia.

Ha!...they knew Americans would NEVER buy this shit!!
   Corporations continue to demand that citizens drink more junk drinks, because profits.    The target:  women / drunk - what could possibly go wrong.
This is deliberately misleading. Franzia has been a brand of Coca-Cola since 1973.
An 8% ABV beverage aimed at young women seems a bit irresponsible...
That just goes to show how more open minded the Japanese are. Americans would probably be up in arms and put Coca-Cola to shame.

Seriously though, why haven't they at least made an official product of the two? The Jack and Cola examples don't count.
They make premade jack n cokes in some places, I got some in Hong Kong a year ago.

Dude as American that was the most surprising thing about living in Hong Kong, the Asian drinking culture is just completely insane, in Lan Kwai Fong (LKF, huge party spot in downtown Hong Kong with lots of night clubs and craziness) they had companies trying to advertise that were literally passing out off-brand four loko’s (with the caffeine and alcohol included) to anyone on the street. 7/11’s in Hong Kong sell liquor, like actual spirits, full size bottles of vodka and rum, etc. 

Asian drinking culture is no fucking joke. There was even a spot in LKF when I was there that was like some 20 shot “challenge” that people would go and do and if you managed to finish all 20 you got the shots half off or some shit. It was wild. So many people passed out in the back of taxis and buses after drinking their guts out.

It was like Mardi Gras in New Orleans but basically every single night and especially the weekends.
Um, no. No one would mix sake and Coke; that's disgusting. I think you're talking about barley shochu, which is what is in most Japanese-originating mixed drinks, because it has a fairly neutral flavor profile like vodka, since it's a distilled spirit. It is only 25% alcohol, though.

And as for the 16-year-old part, white people look older. Also, Japan doesn't get as worked up about underage drinking because they can't drive anyway. That being said, alcohol vending machines are almost completely extinct, which is a damn crying shame. When I first came as a student, it was so cool to do a beer run to the corner vending machine and buy a *three-liter Asahi can* from the machine.
Pour your own beer bars are becoming pretty popular here actually

Got up at 430am this morning because I couldn’t sleep. Played for 2 hours. Glorious. Nuka World is my favorite. Especially now that I found a way around that damn Amoral Combat glitch 
Woah hey there, it's 2018 OK? We're not supposed to read the content, just skim over the title and voice your opinion online!! /s
I loved drinking chu-hi when I visited Japan. I keep looking for it in America but it's seemingly impossible to find.

Part of the problem is how the US taxes distilled spirits, even when watered down in a mixed drink. They also require them to been sold in specific volumes.

So, in the US you end up with flavored "malt beverages" like Mike's Hard Lemonade or Smirnoff Ice which are basically made with beer instead of liquor. They just don't taste nearly as good.
You guys have any interesting white wine mixed drinks?
I’d hope it had 35% ABV
Nestle? Or does Coca Cola do it too? (I thought they used municipal water for Aquafina)
Yeah, I kinda always want to correct people when they call chu-hi alcopop. Some of them are really sweet, but most are not, and many are made with real juice. Also, guys are just as likely to drink them as girls, in my personal estimation.

I used to drink them a lot, but now I avoid sugar. If I want a chu-hi, I mix it myself with fresh juice.
\* Chu-hi.

Also, the article is specifically about that.
How dare corporations cater to the demands of customers!
What's it like to hate everything?
Franzia is produced by The Wine Group
How else will they get laid?
Not to worry, I think that was a mistake in the article.  The picture clearly shows varieties at 3, 5 and 7% respectively.
1) I don't see how it's irresponsible.

2) It's not really aimed at women. That's the part of the article that I think is a bit off. Chu-hi is for everyone.
Uhh why. Wine is marketed to women more, and women do drink wine more than men. That's way stronger ranging from 11% to 15%.
There are very very few things that make Japan an open minded country.
This is absolutely untrue. Sounds like you’re a weaboo. Japanese are definitely not as open as Americans. Also, jack and coke would not be “put to shame” in the USA.
What country?
They have. There are jack and coke cans. 
I’ve been saying this for at least 15 years. And if the JD people won’t play ball, go call the Bacardi people. They’re game, trust me.

How is this not on my grocery shelf already?
Coca Cola-Amatil have a partnership with Jim Beam-Suntory in Australia.
Anti-trust laws.
I bought one in Germany.
Might be different in different territories but in the UK, its JD and a bland generic cola that makes the whole thing rank compared to mixing it fresh with real coke. I'd love proper Coca-Cola with proper jd, not this mess where one side or the other of the drink is a generic knock off. 
They have them in US too..comes in black or green cans.  Doesn't taste like coke and also very weak! 
I was about to say this. Lived in Hong Kong for a bit and the premade jack and cokes that came in little cans that they sold were freakin delicious
Bought some in Playa del Carmen, Mexico last year. Great mix of both!
They're like 22 HKD at 7/11 right now for a bottle. Expensive, but tasty.
They also have them in non-futuristic Canada.
Wait, I know! Cu- uhhh nevermind.
"Demote this man!"
Wait till you get to Korea. $1 soju.

This is not specific to Hong Kong either. I THINK i saw it in Norway, but i definitely saw in Denmark. 
Last weekend I was at Eden in Coco Park, Shenzhen.
It was absolutely insane, and the most surprising thing was that there was NO fighting or bad will, just people getting wasted and partying like crazy.

The whole club was modeled as a mini EDM festival, that was amazing. [Especially the stage!](http://www.thatsmags.com/shenzhen/post/22514/shenzhen-club-review-eden-bar)

I'm not addicted to alcohol, I'm a catholic! 
Oh man even in Japan I would not be getting this new drink as it is only available in the Kyushu area of Japan. So instead i just picked up a bunch of [lemon based drinks](https://i.imgur.com/r8nKSLz.jpg) from Daiei and will be sampling them over time.
I'd never really listened to the lyrics.

You're right.
Fallout is love, Fallout is life.
Reading the content wouldn't have helped anyway. The article is wrong. :)
In Croatia, it is popular to mix white wine with sparkling mineral water. They call that "gemist" that comes from a German word gemischt which simply means "mixed". But, local drinkers made a whole science out of that, depending on the ratio of water in your wine. Before, they used soda water for that.

All wine mixtures in Croatia, especially Dalmatia, come from mixing wine with plain water. It is called "bevanda", this time it is I think Italian word. Very few people mix white wine with orange sodas. I think good white wine is best when you drink it plain. In that sense, best Croatian wine is Malvazija and if you ever run into that wine brand give it a shot. Istria is a Croatian region that resembles famous Italian Tuscany and this type of wine is their local treasure. https://www.rosemurraybrown.com/S=0/rose-uncut/articles/istrian-malvazija
Try watermelon moonshine.  You’ll never taste the alcohol and after 3  shots you are curb crawling, commode hugging, waitress pinching drunk.
Only half or so comes from municipal.  It all comes from the United States however, or so I'm lead to believe.

Opposite in Australia, alcho-pops are predominantly drank by young girls.
Which is a division of The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta Georgia, which every pack reminds.
Right, but a standard serving of wine is 150ml, not 350ml. You'll get *more than twice as much* alcohol from a can of this stuff as you will from a glass of wine.
> Sounds like you’re a weaboo.

Tbf that could be said for a lot of people on Reddit. Any thread involving Japan is 9/10 times a dumpster fire, this one is relatively okay though.
There are JD and *Cola* cans as far as I know, I work for Jack in Canada so it may be different elsewhere. 

Edit: Australia loves the Ready To Drink (RTD) category and that’s the place to go for all the good canned mixes, apparently. Gotta get them cans for the beach bbq I guess! 
They have jack and "cola" cans not jack and "coke."
Actually it's cola, not coke 👌
In case you didn’t hear yet (since you STILL haven’t edited or deleted this comment), it is cola, not Coca-cola brand. 
No. Cola. 
Some people have a good idea, they can be in one can, but in separate compartments in the can (but mix them together when you're ready)
Ah Bacardi, for when you want to drink a rum cocktail, but instead of rum prefer the taste of cleaning alcohol.
No. It has to do with logistics and distribution control laws. 

For starters, production systems are completely different. Distillation/brewing is an entirely different monster than just making syrups and dumping them in bottles. Coke would need to build entirely new factories to manufacture malt beverages, beers, spirits etc

Alcohol controls are likewise another issue. Coke can't just bootstrap alcohol distribution to its already existing distribution network. They would have to be *completely* separate networks and alcohol would be required to go through different channels than they use due to the variety of state laws in play controlling distribution.

It's not illegal for Coca Cola to get into alcohol, it's just prohibitively expensive. Their existing infrastructure and logistics is entirely useless for it and they would basically have to start from scratch to do it. That's why we only ever see a handful of niche products from partnerships.
Someone only half paid attention In high school econ 
Seen them in the UK too. They do the same with captain Morgan rum. Ive also seen pimms and lemonade aswell.

>Soju (/ˈsoʊdʒuː/; from Korean: 소주; 燒酒 [so.dʑu]) is a clear, colorless distilled beverage of Korean origin.[1][2][3] It is usually consumed neat, and its alcohol content varies from about 16.8% to 53% alcohol by volume (ABV)

FIFTY THREE PERCENT ABV... 
Yup, this is standard inventory in all 7-11's I've been to in Denmark.
awwwwwwwww maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. :(
A friend of mine had made homemade moonshine - at the end of a party I had a good swig of it.  I don't remember the drive home but my buddy who drove me home said I was yelling at cars as we drove home.

My spouse was not to pleased when I peed on the floor either. 
They also sell water in 3rd world countries like Sudan and Michigan. They're not going to ship water from the US to there.
The Wine Group hasn't been owned by Coca Cola since 84
I stand corrected 
The answer here would be the Jack Daniel brand is already plenty strong and paying licensing for Coca Cola syrup and brand is probably not worth it. 

Better to just get generic cola syrup and rely on the Jack brand they already own.
My understanding is in Australia, COCA-COLA Amatil supplies the cola for Ready To Drink cans of Jack Daniels, Jim Bean, and other cola varieties. I think it really depends on location. 
Definitely no jack/coke combo in Australia
You know what else is RTD? Whiskey.
Did you not notice how I already acknowledged this and said I was wrong? Or did you just feel like commenting 
Read the rest of the comment chain before being the fourth person to correct me por favor. For everyone's sake
As a consumer idk why you would want that...

You know that is going to be like triple the price of doing the same thing yourself with a bottle of coke and seperate a bottle of JD.
Also, doesn't the Jack make the cola flat after awhile? 
You have the right idea but you're missing the most important part.

The coca cola company just makes the syrup. There is a completely separate entity that is the bottling company. 
I think he was trying to be funny. 
So just let coke licebse the rights to jd and let them deal with bottling and distribution 
I would think image also plays a large role. 
The comment was 3 minutes old when you said this. How could you possibly know it was underrated?
It looks like my mild compliment was misconstrued, sorry for the confusion folks

No u.  Cola
[deleted]
I’d imagine a sealed container would take care of that, but it’s still possible the long term mix could adversely affect the taste of the final product. 
Jack already makes a Jack and Cola in a can. 

The Jack Daniels brand is already plenty strong, I don't think adding "Coca Cola" to the label would be worth the licensing cost. They're likely better off just bringing in generic cola syrup and keeping the can just their own branding.
Oh I didn't even realize that haha, just saw it and it made me giggle. 
Meta-comments don't tend to do well on reddit and other asynchronous mediums. So don't leave comments like "haha" and "good comment" if you value your karma
Damn. That hurt. 
Squats breh
It was in the same chain. Directly underneath. At least finish reading the chain before jumping to conclusions. Then maybe we wouldn't have 20 different people correcting the same person in every single Reddit thread.

Only on Reddit can you get downvotes for encouraging people to understand what they're replying to. Lol
Maybe you should take your own advice? 
No Coke!
A sealed container with two compartments, then? Like those [yogurt cups that comes with mix-in stuff.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/newamysite.selenesoftware.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/08213537/Yoplait-4.jpg)

Overrated comment.
rated comment.
This I imagine means the Coke name won't be on any cannabis beverage. Would that prevent some other brand, owned by Coke, to create the beverage? Who knows, but any business that makes food or drink must be looking at this new product/market. 
The article from Reuters that says they were in talks says come "released a statement" that confirmed this.

>Coca-Cola announced its interest in a statement on Monday, responding to a report from BNN Bloomberg that said it was in talks with Canada’s Aurora Cannabis Inc (ACB.TO) to develop drinks infused with cannabidiol (CBD)

 So which is it? Did they or didn't they release a statement?

Should be easy to verify.
Yeah, a drink brand that had cocaine in it for decades certainly wouldn't want to be associated with marijuana.  It would be bad for the brand.
I expect an independent startup with a surprising amount of investment money, that no one seems to know where it came from, to announce precisely this product in a few weeks time.
They won’t do anything till it’s federal in the USA.
Damn, got my dopes up for nothing.
I once mixed my CBD oil with a Diet Coke. 0/10 would not purchase cannabis infused soda.
I guess Coca Cola trucks cant cross from Canada into the US anymore 
Here for the Cocaine references
for Coca-cola, it's cocaine-based only.
They'd never use narcotics in their drinks, who ever heard of such a thing?
“We are well beyond looking at cannibas infused soft drinks and consider the matter closed.” lol
But why would anyone even bother?
Coca-Cola would be fools to NOT be looking at making cannabis-based drinks... they should always be looking at every option of any product to keep up with new markets and existing market demands and trends.

>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the difference is that marijuana,**which is the dried leaves of the cannabis plaint**, does contain THC.

What kind of autism is this? 
They don't want to announce it and get banned from the US.
So they floated a trial balloon. Reply came back, so they denied they're looking. 
Awww, mannnn...  Reddit came up with so many good potential names...
This is a completely useless "update."

It's leaving out the fact that coke is basically saying "no, not marijuana, but cbd, maybe that, not sure yet." Which is what the original story said in the first place.
They'll just wait until someone else makes a popular cannabis drink and buy that company.
The mormons own something like 40% of Coca cola so they'll have to create a new shell corporation to appease shareholders.
Not a new thing. These drinks have been around for a while. 
When I read that report earlier, it sounded like bogus news to me. When all 50 states legalize marijuana for recreational use, then I can see a Coca-Cola product with pot extracts. 
I think a big part of coke drinkers would look forward to a cannabis drink. Coke is hiding the development.
Guys - who blabbed?! Now we gotta deny the existence of Operation Humboldt Coke!
Why is this such a big deal, There like 8 different post worded slightly differently to this about this shit. Coke used to have cocaine in it so if anything they just going bcack to their roots of trying to get you to drink drugs, it's not that big a deal. Blow reddit up when they do go back to cocaine since a can-a-canabis is the gateway drug 
I think Coke leaked the rumor as a cheap way to gauge how the public would react to a product like this.
My plan all along has been to create a line of marijuana-infused smartwater and call it "dumbwater"
Right. I'd bet $50 they already have "Canna-Cola" trademarked.
This seems like a road to disaster.  The last thing we need is a combo of sugary drinks with weed.  They will straight up kill people with this. RIP your pancreas.
Uh huh.  A corporation with a duty to shareholders to maximize dividends wouldn't be at all interested in a gold mine where you just pick the nuggets off the bush.
Coke wanting the free publicity for a day. The same company that used to put cocaine in it's drinks in the 19th century.
Good decision, no money in pot pop.
I'd welcome that as long as it is sold in designated areas e.g. liquor stores or requiring legal age proof otherwise. 'Cause I can't imagine them marketing it for kids lol. A version of "adult" coke :)
They will it Cana-Cola
They used to use cocaine. Funny.
I would rather have a canabis drink than a beer it think. 
yeah if they were smart they would be. i already have a dr pepper addiction and love weed so.... and this goes with any beloved snack or beverage. i would clear the shelves of thc dr pepper and some takis lol
Its CBD for Powerade
I think 50% of all liquids in the late 1800s contained some form of cocaine. 
They didn't have enough cocaine in them to get anybody high...it would have a similar effect to what caffeine gives you. Coca-Cola is literally a combination of coca leaves (containing cocaine) and the kola nut (containing caffeine).
It was *wine* with cocaine in it. Alcohol increases cokes effects.
Yeah I don’t think that would be an issue if they thought that public perception of mj was on their side.
This probably has less to do with them worrying it hurts the brand and way more to do with the fact that if they were moving to do something like this, they wouldn't want competitors to catch wind this early on.
It still has coca, but none of the good stuff, just for flavoring

https://bgr.com/2015/08/24/coca-cola-recipe-cocaine-leaves/

People say this like it was odd at the time there was cocaine in so many products its honestly not even funny.

Like it was seen as tame as caffeine being put into everything nowadays....but cocaine.
Both coke and weed used to be medicinal.

Turns out they're just drugs. 
Why can't they do it in Canada? 
False. They're going to keep it under wraps until it's federally legal so they can be the first major company with cannabis based drinks. Assuming pepsi hasn't already beaten them to the punch. 
Dont put oil in soda.  Put cbd oil in a drink with milk because it emulsifues.  Put glycerin tincture cbd in soda.
I've had some that didn't taste bad. I think it was the Elixir brand.
I once mixed my mentos with a diet coke. -10/10 would not purchase mentos infused soda. 
Because the beverage industry has been highly profitable for Coca Cola?
Yeah grow a pair and get right into bud and concentrates
It's for a CBD wellness beverage not something that gets you high.
Dr. Pepper has been dead to me ever since they shut down Dublin Dr. Pepper.

R.I.P.
When we're drugs made illegal actually ?
Cocaine/cannabis/morphine dissolved in 17% alcohol. 

That’ll cure what ails ya! 
Honestly explains a lot about the 1800s
the dose makes the effects, people would view coffee as an evil if they were shown propaganda of people iving caffeine or going on benders of 10g/week with sleepless nights
You can get high on caffeine. 
I don’t see them implementing it unless they can target their biggest consumer.
He biologies.
Old people love weed when they see the benefits from it
I always laugh when people cite CBD over and over again as some miracle part of weed that helps people but doesn't get them "high".

Where for me literally weed/dabs with higher concentration of CBD gets me completely fucked up because the sativa effects have always been light for me.

idk its just irritating that this word "high" has been made into a dirty word like a buzz word that means recreational.

People literally get high to ignore pain and get high to ignore emotional pain as well.

Most people who are on pills are high to an extent.

Again when you feel couch locked and you can barely move your body like the classic definition of "stoned" thats CBD your feeling.
oh what i didnt know they ever made it in europe... when i visited it was so fucking expensive, and it was just coke in glass bottles. like wtf i feel sorry that you guys dont get to experience fountain sodas lol 
Around 1914 for cocaine. Before making Coca Cola, it's creator actually had a drink made out of wine and cocaine. When Georgia banned alcohol (but not cocaine) in the late 1800s, he came up with Coca Cola.
There was a push during the early 20th century - paper industry had it out for hemp and the temperance movement and increased understanding of health risks started the process

I'd imagine it'd be effective if people actually did go on benders of caffeine. 
except you know its cocaine not caffeine lmfao. Don't get me wrong there are tame drugs out there that people blow way out of proportion I'd say cocaine earns its name/reputation pretty respectably.

Its not something to fuck with but I believe its possible to be just as dangerous as alcohol.

Just most people don't get so addicted to alcohol that you see the horror of what can truly be a bad addiction. Like you'd die if you stopped cold turkey that kind of severity doesn't happen with most drug addictions.
Why not? Coca Cola is huge and diverse.. Here's an example:

The original Four Loko
>When Georgia banned alcohol (but not cocaine)

I see they had their priorities straight.
Not just paper industry.  Duponts also invented nylon rope and synthetic textiles around the same time.
If you want to know more about this look up William Randolph Hearst. He lead a racist campaign against Mexicans that popularized and demonized the term marijuana. He needed to protect his interests in the timber industry, as hemp was stronger and cheaper to grow. On top of that he had lost around 800,000 acres of land to Pancho Villas troops in the Mexican Revolution. To say the least he wasn’t fond of minorities and significantly less fond of Mexicans. He ran a smear campaign against “Marihuana” that claimed it caused murderous rampages by black and Mexican people. 
You know what’s funny? Hemp has been being trashed for far longer, we’ve known for a long time it’s a better fiber, and better for fields (don’t have to rotate crops with hemp...) read up on King cotton, the English need for cotton, and the civil war. Conveniently the English helped push for cotton over hemp for many reasons, but one being cotton doesn’t grow in the north, and it helped to find the south and not the north 
Such a lie. Why aren't companies using hemp today? Because, it's crap material for basically any industry. It's been surpassed decades ago in cost, durability, and strength by synthetics. 
No, the paper industry never gave a shit about hemp. That's a pothead conspiracy theory of the most idiotic kind. 

Hemp paper is not cheaper than wood paper and never has been. That's why wood replaced hemp, and linen, and cotton and other fiber sources as a paper making material in the 19th century as soon as mechanical pulping, and later chemical pulping, was invented.


It was effectively outlawed decades before Nixon.

So you've never done coke is what you're saying

As far as I knew cocaine isn’t physically addictive, just mentally? 
Just a sidenote and tip about Japan:  *DO NOT EAT THE RED BEAN KIT KAT.....it tastes bad.*
Actually, after taking it over they started selling bottles that look much like the Dublin ones made with sugar instead of corn syrup.  I don't know if it's exactly the Dublin recipe, but it's a fair sight better than the corn infested version.
Your phone does the same thing mine does with periods 
i had dr pep in the US and thought it was vile, but i later tried it in the UK and it wasn't bad.  maybe the diff is that the US version uses HFCS?
probably not, people getting as smashed as possible is older than history
At the time it was significantly better than tree pulp paper, Which deteriorated over time. 
They have it here, where I live. Taste pretty good, just pricey.
I still seem to be able to eat the candy here, but literally any beverage containing HFCS makes me sick to my stomach for days. 

I developed a nagging, all-day stomach ache sometime last year that just wouldn't go away no matter how much I switched up what I ate.

 Then I remembered those Gatorades and sodas, I was still drinking like 2+ 18oz a day! 

As soon as I went on an "whatever you want to eat but only water to drink" diet, my stomach fixed itself and I lost 10 lbs of bloated fat from all that damn sugar
Cotton paper, linen paper and hemp paper were always better quality-wise than wood paper and still are, the fibers are longer, and it contains no liginin. We can remove lignin completely now but we can't make wood fibers longer.

Paper was made out of those sources until the 19th century. Wood paper didn't take over because it was stronger or better quality, it took over because it was **cheaper**. **Far cheaper**. And especially in the case of newspapers, expensive durable paper is the last thing you need. Daily newspapers literally did not exist until wood pulping made paper cheap enough in the 19th century.

Only dumb potheads who know literally nothing about paper making believe this shit.
It tastes like someone left it on the floorboard of a car for three or four years.
..... wow, someone needs their morning bowl
Look like you're not accustomed to slightly unsweeted, tad strong red bean flavour.
Just tastes like a stale Kitkat, honestly.
>It was unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan

Well then...my life is unchanged.

I got excited about pre-made rum and coke. :(
~~Nuka~~ Coca-Cola Dark? 
Canned burbon and coke has been around for a while. 
Hope to fuck it's not based off the drink 'Beverly'

It's so bad, there's signs everywhere in the Coke place in Atlanta telling you to try it, and it's just abysmal. 


<Insert Nuka Cola Dark reference here>
rule #1: don't mix uppers and downers.
 
They should stick to coke... 
Some of those Chu-hai drinks are potent. I've found them to be a pretty easy way to get drunk quickly for pretty cheap and they're pretty tasty too.
Are they going to make a Rum & Coke in a can? Basically a  Cuba Libre , but with a different name?

maybe they think they haven't done enough yet to poison everyone
Why not add marijuana ? 
"You put the rum in the coke you nut and drink'em both together...."
How about a little liver disease with your cancer!?
cacaine infused didint work??

Edit: cocaine 
Like Powerade? Pretty sure coke owns that already
Didn't Pepsi try this? I remember hearing about it and then nothing.
Their master plan is to completely wrap up the White Russian market.  
TLDR: Coke has entered the big market for shochu in Japan. 
What’s next, cocaine in a soft drink?
I've seen pre bottles "Jack and coke" for a while. Pretty good stuff might I add.
First they get people addicted with cocaine, now it'll be fizzy acidic alcohol?!? Wait...Mike's got that market cornered.
Not really there first ever.  In 1970 they bought mogen david winery or what you probably know as MD 20/20.
I want Blaq Coke back
I wish they would re-launch their cocaine drinks... :(
"Launch"?  Like Coca-Cola has made a new beverage.

They bought it and will just continue to sell it.

Coke doesn't do innovation.  Coke does acquisition.
They should just go back to cocaine
The things you think you remember, and are incorrect about. I thought Zima was Coke. (It was actually Coors.) 
Coca-Vodka 

It's way more dangerous than it sounds.
The Suntory highball's that come in can's is fantastic in Japan.  I wish we had them here in the states. 
Wonder if it will taste like crap like their cola. Pepsi is king.
If it has caffiene in it, they couldn't sell it in the US anyway.
You can still likely buy it to be shipped overseas.
Eh i am sure you can buy it on eBay soon.

Probably can't sell these in the US, but I wish they would. 


That already exists though 
In Germany they have a drink called mixery.  It's soda mixed with beer.  It's disgusting.
Ice cold.
Around here we have Coca-Cola park.
if you're looking for a refreshing way to make it through the day, try a Nuka-Cola Dark. Same great cola taste, with an alcohol twist. 
I was also traumatized by Beverly.  Then I learned it's supposed to be more of a palette cleanser that makes everything afterwards taste better instead of a regular enjoyable beverage. Maybe that's just the lie they told to justify its hideousness.
Many common cocktail ingredients taste similar to Beverly. I'm sure it goes great with gin and sweet vermouth
I'm gonna need a little more info on Beverly.  Never heard of it.
They have it free to try at Disney in Epcot too, like a cruel joke.
the liquor before beer rule i can understand. mixing uppers and downers i would think would create some balance. 
Rule #1 is thou shalt have no other gods before me, checkmate kiddo 😎
Rule #2: Don't mix updoots and downers. 
I think you mean they're fucking amazing. Also sold in every 7/11 or Lawson in Japan.

Don't forget to pick up some liver enzymes so you don't get a hangover. I love Japan.

The caffeine ban hasn't stopped the rise of "soda" type alcohol drinks in the US. Brands like Not Your Father's have found a lot of success selling alcoholic beverages mimicking popular soda flavors.

I've got to imagine Coke has been keeping an eye on that trend.
Can't you buy those pre-mixed Jack Daniels and coke in the US?  That has alchohol and caffeine
I'm pretty sure consumers can't import alcohol in the US.  There was an Earl Gray Liqueur only sold in like three stores in Japan that I wanted to try but USPS doesn't let you ship it and FEDEX and UPS only seem to want to do it if you have an alcohol importing license.
Its just rum and coke not rocket appliances
Man's gotta eat. Right, Dusty?
Well, it would be nice if they had one with balanced sweetness and either a rum or a Coke variant optimized for the combination. Sometimes you get it wrong with the choice of rum or the proportions, especially after you've had a few.
$20 for a 6 pack. fuck that
But its not made with coke. Got knows what soda they use. You can't make rum and coke without coke.
leinenkugels does beer shandies with soda and they are amazing. favorite one is watermelon, followed by summer, and grapefruit. i fucking hate grapefruits too but this tastes good.
It's a joke I play on people new to Atlanta telling them that it's fantastic. 

It's carbonated moose piss. 
As soon as I saw that it was marketed in Italy I knew it was gonna be bitter, most Italian bitters have a very peculiar taste that doesn't fit most people.
I don't think they'd enjoy me making mixed drinks during the tour, but I will keep that in mind. 
I've never seen it on retail shelves, and I'm in the heart of the beast where it all started. 

It's hard to describe, but the general consensus for everyone I know that has been to the World of Coke typically does not like the drink. 
It's a drink that the Coca-Cola company only sells in Italy. At the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta (along with "club cool" at Epcot in Walt Disney World) there is a tasting room where you can try Coke drinks  from around the world, this is where Beverly gets it's notoriety from all the tourists being dared to try it (it tastes awful)
Only one way to find out! 
It's easy for uppers and downers to get out of hand but mixing them was my go to party state 
When you go up and down at once, you shoot off sideways.

It's not a balance, it's a whole new animal and very pleasant. 

Like blow with liquor. Great fun, but not good at all for the ticker... And a recipe for a gnarly dehydrated puking hangover.
When you take both, your body can't decide whether you should be upped or downed and freaks out, your heart goes into arrhythmia while simultaniously trying to be relaxed and be excited, and you maybe die. 

Don't drink any of those red bull cocktails, kids.
Energetic and sleepy is a bad combination.
I'd buy that
Not sure what's going on with that entry.  Coca-Cola used to have cocaine and doesn't anymore.  It was changed when they decided to sell it as a drink instead of a medication.  Why would that be mixed when the "myth" is entirely true?
You are very correct, and funny. Thank you
They ruined 4loko with this. Let me get my hands on the dangerous stuff, otherwise I'm going to keep mixing redbull and vodka. 
Correct, but I think the point is that coke has caffeine, and the FDA banned any caffeine in alcoholic beverages because four lokos were killing people. So if it had added caffeine and booze, it would be fun and therefore illegal in the US. Just like fully automatic rifles, because they can kill people if used improperly.
I had one a few years back when traveling overseas somewhere. I don’t remember how it tasted but it’s an awesome idea.

Welcome to Australia, where the drinks are expensive as the snakes are deadly.
I actually used to get coke all the time, but nowadays I just find it kind of gross. Anyways, I eventually discovered the the stop and shop brand cola was honestly better then regular coke, and a bit cheaper too. People would rip on me for it when they come over, but eventually they would all end up agreeing w/ me that the off-brand was actually better.

TL:DR; stop and shop brand cola is better than coke.
I found and tried bottles of it from Jack Daniels. It was called Blackjack I think? Tasted perfect
We already did this. Does no one remember Four Loko?
Ok Grandpa, what next, you tell me I can't use 4Loko as mixers for Jager. 
C'mon now.....
meh, people been drinking jack and coke for decades. 
It's "mixed" because Coca-Cola has always had coca leaf extract. The earlier extract process couldn't get all of the cocaine out of the final extract.
Or just drink straight bourbon like a normal person.
I'm sorry but four lokos and fully automatic rifles are not comparable.
Coca Cola sells noncaffeineted sodas. My point is you can make a soda flavored alcoholic beverage without caffeine. Companies are already doing it. 
A gun is designed to kill. That is *literally* its purpose. A drink like Four Loko *is not designed to kill*. You are being intellectually dishonest to try to imply that guns are not manufactured for the sole purpose of being a weapon. If you truly believe this, you have no business owning a firearm. 


Eh, Fully automatic rifles are technically legal, but only if they were manufactured before a certain year.

That said, a reasonably sober person could probably be safe with a fully automatic rifle. The problem with a four loko is that it causes you to be so alert that you don't even realize that you're drunker then you are. Not only do you combine the stupid "I'm going to slam down so many brewskis", but you also risk the college stupidity of slamming down a bunch of red bulls, and the alcohol could theoretically impair your "Should I do this" judgement. Plus a single four loko can had as much alcohol as a couple bud lights.

It's not the FDA's fault people are stupid, and the FDA also more or less just asked Four Loko to not add caffeine because college students would get drunk and overdose on alcohol or caffeine. It's not mixing alcohol and caffine that's illegal, it's providing an unsafe food additive.
Coke and Jack Daniels is awesome. My go-to drink. DIY it till you get the proportions perfect to your taste.
I wouldn't recommend them but they're a [thing](https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/jack+daniel+whisky+cola+tennessee+usa)
What? I think you're missing the point here. Like by a long way
Yeah, but now that necessitates me pulling together the cash for the Japanese vacation.
Fuck you're right. I have brought shame on my family. And I owe you a cheeseburger. But don't call me Shirley
Jack Daniels makes Whiskey 
Define remember 
It was the best of crimes. Now its the worst of crimes.
I remember a two year blackout, does that count?
The snopes article itself notes that cocaine was one of the medicinal ingredients.  They started cutting it out when they stopped selling it as a medicinal tonic.
Clearly you've never had an old Four Loko.
6 lokos deep would like a word with you... 
You're right but I'm also right?

Malt beverages have a lower ABV% than actual mixed-liquor drinks.
Rum and whiskey is just as good though. Honestly if you gave me a rum and coke and a whiskey and coke I would have trouble telling you which one is which.
The article says there was, but that statement isn't supported by the citations that it refers to. The quoted statements only refer to coca extract.

Seriously though they fucked you up
We're talking about the legality of having caffeine and alchohol in one beverage. Nothing to do with malt vs any other kind of alchohol. 
the real good drink is rum and dr pepper. the flavors mesh better than with coke
Well, yes.  Those quotes don't encompass the medicinal phase.  They're about it's formulation as a soft drink.

Edit:
Besides, what is cocaine if it's not a coca extract?
I could smell the pizza as the driver was pulling up. Shit's crazy
The legality of having caffeine and alcohol in one beverage, and that conversation could go shift to the legality of certain levels of caffeine and alcohol. 

Remember FourLoco, how they were in the news because the high caffeine and alcohol contents? They had to reformulate to tone down the caffeine. Caffeinated alcopop still exists, and it's more regulated regarding the levels.

I mention malt vs. spirits because malt is lower, and spirits is higher, so if something is limited to lower ABV it could potentially have higher caffeine?

No need to jump on me telling me I'm wrong.
Dr. Pepper is pretty much just great all around. Like it's good on its own, but also goes well with most alcohol that I keep around.

Tip: Try Southern Comfort and Dr. Pepper. Might be a bit sweet to some people, but I find it delicious.
Cocaine is only part of the coca extract.

Coca-Cola has coca extract in it to this very day. The company that processes the leaves for them are *very* good at removing the cocaine from the extract to make the feds happy. 
>so if something is limited to lower ABV

Four Loko was discontinued (temporarily) due to the caffeine content, not the alcohol content. 
What do they do with the left over cocaine? Asking for a friend.
So then, only saying "coca extract" wouldn't rule out cocaine.  Right?
It was both, actually. The combination of both, at the levels they were at?

Layoff 350 people =$800 million savings?

That’s $2.85 mil a person.  
Is this because people are drinking less pop because it's bad for you and has NOTHING to do with Obama, Trump, the Democrats, or the GOP?

http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/25/investing/coca-cola-job-cuts-earnings/index.html

Yup.
I blame their diet coke ad campaign
  350 people= 800M in savings?   
Coke didn't diversify well enough into snacks and junk food like Pepsi did.
[deleted]
Peddlers of sugary drink that uses an immense amount of energy to produce plastic bottles, only some of which get recycled. Said company also uses lots of fuel to transport an unnecessary beverage long distances. It's all just so wasteful.
Asking the important questions.
Maybe Coke has a cloning facility 
> That’s $2.85 mil a person.

The savings aren't instant. It's probably forecast out to 10 or 20 years. 
[deleted]
Article says 1,200 employees so its closer to 2/3 a billion dollars per employee. 

Depending on the state Coke wouldn't even need to report a layoff of 350 people and it probably wouldn't have been in the news. Not sure what Georgia's layoff laws are but in Florida any layoff that is over 499 employees or 33% of the workforce have to be reported and the media picks up those reports. 
I grew up saying pop, but 10 years ago moved to a location that calls it soda. Now pop sounds weird.
Almost like it's demand that drives employment.
buzzkill  :P
Wrong Saudi Arabian Muslim Kings own Pepsi, THERE ARE JIHAD SUGARS IN YOUR HOME RIGHT NOW! Just waiting to suicide bomb your teeth's enamel. 
Or maybe the new Coke tastes like shit? I've since moved to Pepsi. 
1,200 in total.

Facilities they work won't need to maintained anymore. Phones, internet, heat, electricity, etc...

My organization figured it was $15,000/yr per cubicle to keep us in the city...went to working remote instead. Company saved millions and we get to work from home.


> 350 people= 800M in savings?

That's about right, assuming it's forecast savings over the next 20 years.
Yeah just Minute Maid, Dasani, Monster Energy Drink, Simply Orange...off the top of my head. But you’re right, no snacks just beverages 
These layoff were announced a year ago...well before the tax cut details were ever announced.

Consider a profitable public company, cutting labor directly increases pre tax profit by the amount of the cut, but shareholder value is dependent on post tax profit, and the mission of a public firm is to increase shareholder value.

If you had a 50% profits tax and cut a $10M worth of labor, you only get $5M of post tax profit. At a 20% rate, cutting that same $10M of labor gets $8M of post tax profit. So on the margin for a profitable firm, lower tax rates increase the monetary incentive to cut labor and other deductible costs.

I'd bet that the data of 2018 in the US will ultimately show that profitable companies cut labor more than unprofitable companies, as paradoxical as that sounds. Motives at the margins...
So accounting fraud. Got it. 
just call it soda pop and weird everyone out....  no reason to pick sides!
I’ve always said soda, even though I lived in a redneck community that called it pop, or even more cringeworthy: Coke. That referred to any brand of soda. 
People don't realize how expensive employees are.  When I first started my role at my company's helpdesk one of my duties included doing equipment set-up for newly hired employees.

Software developers cost around ~30-40k in desktops, monitors, laptop, phone, and other workspace accessories (specific keyboards, mice, headphones, webcams/video conferences setups, etc).  This is all on top of their 6 figure salary, bonuses, stock, perks and benefits.  
Yeah and neither player was particular strong with more healthy drinks which is why FIZZ is doing spectacular. They own LaCroix and a few other setlzer type drinks and their stock is valued almost as much as Pepsi. Expecting FIZZ to get a buyout soon but I think its overvalued at this point.
The key here is “announced.” Major corporations write the legislation. They know well in advance what is going to happen. 
Researchers at Wharton looked at this question already and concluded that there is no evidence that layoffs help firm performance beyond providing a very quick "pop" to the stock when they are announced.

So basically the opposite of what you're saying unless you define profitability in the very short term.
That isn't fraud. And I don't think you know anything about accounting. The savings aren't instant. It's probably forecast out to 10 or 20 years. 
Username checks out. 
My oldest sister will on occasion say “soda poppy” for the same reason. I keep meaning to use the term “sody water.”
Call it soda pop and I'd think you were talking about playing Punch-Out on Nintendo.

Cringe worthy is how you say you want a Coke Coke and they know you mean coca-cola
Everything is Coke in the south. Even Pepsi is a Coke.
Can you really consider hardware a cost of an employee and not operations?

Microsoft wouldn't really say "wow employees are expensive. We need to buy a computer so we can do what our business does"
Holy crap.  Can I work for your company?

They must work in nirvana for that amount of costs!
[deleted]
Sody water is just fun to say, is why I say it. Then again, I'm from a region where people buy Mountain Dew on the regular but call everything "coke."
In high school I went to a friends house and his mom asked if I wanted a Coke and I said “sure” and she brought us all Mountain Dew. I about fuckin died. 
A lot of corporations paid good money for the vote to pass, the stock market was skyrocketing for a full year before it passed all on the fact that it was going to.

Good! now bring back Ecto-cooler, please.
Has anyone heard of savesurge.org? This site has literally been up for over 10 years. http://www.savesurge.org/  Today is a day to remember, never give up on your dreams. 
Back in the late 90s, when I was a socially-inept teen, a few of my other socially-inept teen friends would have Axis and Allies weekends, which included a very regimented tradition of cold stale pizza and warm flat Surge.  It's been 14 years since I had one of those weekends.

Maybe it's time for the Axis to be beaten back again.
This is something literally every marketing company can rave over.

Brand loyalty and massive marketing developed during the decade spanning the late 80s to 90s created a generation of children so interwoven into the fabric of American consumption that they, nearly two decades later, pine for a soda only slightly dissimilar to what's already on market. 

It would be astonishing that a movement of such magnitude could be developed around a soda, but in perspective it's exactly what we can expect from a final generation of mall shoppers crowing to relive their glory days drinking Surge and listening to Filter/ Orgy/ Limp Biskit. 

The driving force behind the call for Surge is a tribute to its marketing and the nostalgia it generates to a whole market of former adolescents driven to the beat of brand marketing like Pavlovian bells. 

And like I was trained for the first formative 20 years of my life, I too, desperately want a six pack of surge, an unopened box of MTG:Tempest and Life is Peachy playing on a CD player in another room.


This is great right next to the article link about 50% of US adults being pre-diabetic or diabetic.
And it's already sold out.

Woohoo! Slurm is back! *It's highly addictive!*
Apparently Norway was the only country still selling (s)Urge prior to this. Mind blown.
I need that green, that hocus pocus focus juice, don't need a fo or a deuce, just need that surge to help me get through.
now if we can just get *OK Soda* too.
Can confirm, I work at Amazon and saw a pallet full of them last night.
The 14 year old inside me just had an orgasm.

Wait...
Why not Josta?
[SUUUUUURGE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTY8hrvFck8)
Surge would go amazingly well with some Doritos 3D.
I want Pepsi crystal to make a comeback 
Bring back Clearly Canadian! 
I can't be the only one that misses Sprite remix
Mannn now if they'd just bring back 3D Doritos. I miss them so much.
Now we need to bring back the original Jolt from the late 80s. All the sugar and twice the caffeine! 
One step closer to Brawno! It got electrolytes!
"You are signed up to receive an email when this item is available. "
I used to work for a bottler that made Surge... it was the worst product to make.

All of Coca Cola's products are unitized so you know how much of each ingredient to add to your batch tank in order to make it properly. 10 units of surge called for some liquid concentrate, citric acid, potassium citrate, sodium benzoate, and a literal ton of maltodextrin. Yes, 2000 pounds of malto, packed in 50 lb bags that required cutting open and dumping manually into a batch hopper.

The hopper worked by the venturi effect, sucking powder into the water stream as the tank filled. You only had a finite amount of water to use to get all 2000 pounds into the tank, and that shit was sticky and would gum up the works if you poured too fast.

The worst part of all this was our filling lines could run 15-20 units an hour, but we only had two tanks and could only batch it up 10 units at a time. So on a long production run, you would find yourself slinging 3 or 4 tons of maltodextrin over the course of half a shift just to keep up with production.

tl/dr: I worked for a bottler that made Surge in the 1990s. Fuck Surge.
As a teen back in the '90s, my friends and I would frequently feed our rushes by drinking this fully-loaded citrus soda while feasting on the finest Bigfoot pizzas Pizza Hut had to offer.

This would fuel our late night SNES sessions, DOS games, and accompany the latest VHS rental from the local video store. That was the shiznit... Well, my home skillets, gotta bounce!
I want sprite remix



ARUBA HAM!
I'm looking at you Pepsi (Crystal Clear Pepsi)!

Now can we PLEASE work on getting back Snapple Rain??!

edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! I didnt realize there were other people who loved that cactus juice as much as I did!
I remember, vividly, Surge coming to my High School as part of its marketing launch.  The gave us free Surge, coupons for free Surge, and coupons for buy one get one free Surge (when the other coupons ran out).  Those of us on the Coke mailing list (which included me as one of my high school hobbies had been to call up 800 numbers for national corporations and ask them obnoxious questions or leave odd feedback) also got 2 free Surge CDs.  One for us and one to give a friend.  The songs were like Surge itself, bad at first, and then good, and then stuck with you forever.

It was a brilliant campaign, because by the time we were done with our free Surge, my friends and I were converts.  No more Mountain Dew to fuel out all night World of Darkness campaigns, no sir, we were Surge men now!
My friends and I used to set a can of Surge on one end of a friend's basement and scatter obstacles (tables, couches, what have you) in the path to it. Then we'd line up at the opposite end, one of us would yell SUUUURGGGE, and we'd all fight each other and the obstacles to be the one to get to it. Ahh, memories. 
So this is a shot in the dark but since there are a lot of 90's era folks in the thread, here goes:

There used to be a pizza shop near me in the mid-90s that had a non-carbonated cherry flavored fountain drink. It was amazing. They stopped carrying it because people would order it thinking it was soda and then return or have them dump it when they found it wasn't carbonated. No other cherry drink comes close to that stuff and I spoke with the owner and all he could tell me was that it was a Pepsi product. I've never found out what it was still to this day, and constantly search. Reddit, help me!
I don't know how it came about, but there was a rumor while in middle school, shortly after the release of Surge... the rumor was it would shrink your balls.  Months later it was not included in any of the vending machines. 
Surge. Good god. Won my first gameboy from one
I won a surge alarm clock when I was a kid. it would just keep screaming "SURGE!" really loud until you turned it off. it was the scariest/most efficient alarm I had as a kid.
Now all we need is for Hi-C to bring back Ecto Cooler and we'll be in business.
Bring back Josta, then we can talk.
We already have it in Norway, its called "Urge", excactly the same from Coca-Cola
I be the people at /r/HailCorporate are going fucking nuts over this whole thing.
I'm slightly amused to see this link sharing the front page of r/news with this one:  "50% of US Adults have either pre-diabetes or diabetes."

An alleged Coca Cola employee stated that Surge would be back a few months ago.

He....he actually delivered...
I'm happy that Surge is back, even though I was never a fan.

But Where is ‪#‎CRYSTALPEPSI‬?????????

The social media demand for that is 6 years old now, I didn't know Pepsi hated money, why does pepsi hate money? Stop hating money pepsi, bring back crystal pepsi so you can have our money. if you hate money that much, you should still release crystal pepsi, then take our money, but before it can bother you give our money to charity, or kittens. I don't care what you do with the money just give us crystal pepsi.
This just goes to show that Crystal Pepsi has a chance to make a comeback

Can we just bring back the 90's in general?
Anyone else remember those Surge commercials that had people flippin' out and screaming "SUUURGE!". That made me want to break shit as a kid.

I just want Vanilla coke back. It's impossible to find in my area.
In the Beginning, the Coke said,
"Let there be Surge."
And there was Surge. And it was good.

And then A Great Darkness spread o'er the land.
And the Light of Surge was snuffed out.
Like a fart in the wind.

And Lo, the nights were long.
And lonely.
And lacking in Surge.

And in these desperate years,
We Lay with Red Bull.
And with Vault.

And yet as we looked upon ourselves in the mirror,
We felt only emptiness in our hearts.
For our love was true, and belonged only to Surge.

But Hark! The voice of the people rang out in the night.
And we would not be silenced.
And we would not be ignored.

And then from the darkness,
When all hope seemed lost,
Surge rose from the ashes like a Glorious Phoenix.

And the people rejoiced.
For they never gave up, and never surrendered hope,
That we might one day again take pure joy into our mouth holes.

That Day has Arrived.
Hope has Become Reality.
The Light of Surge shines brightly once more.

Drink up Brothers,
Drink up Sisters.
Your Prayers have been Answered.
What if after all this campaigning, the Surge Movement founders tasted the soda and found that they actually hated it now? 
Meh.  Jolt cola or it doesn't matter. 
it's back in stock on amazon. gogogogogogo

[Yes! Now I can redeem my Surge points and own Jenna Maroney!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_43x-BmHEk)
should have brought back Citra instead.
In this era of literally hundreds or thousands of different types of craft beer from the US alone, this raises the question: "Why not just bring back all forgotten sodas?" Clearly there's a market for all of them. 
We actually have this soda in Norway. Its really popular and every shop sells it.

diabeetus at an all time high this time next year!
Sometime after Surge came out my 1980 Ford Fairmont was rear-ended. Passersby and firefighters ushered me and everyone else away from my car as liquid was pouring out of the back of my car. Later when I went to the lot to collect my belongings from the totaled vehicles I opened the trunk and witnessed the shrapnel of 100+ exploded cans of Surge that I had bought at a ridiculous discount due to promo coupons. It was Surge, not gasoline that poured all over the highway that fateful day.
Anyone else get the surge promo cd with third eye blind , sugar ray and done other random 90's bands?
Bring back Vault, you cowards!
OH MY GOODNESS. This is amazing. I drank so much of that as a kid, surge with Baja picante Doritos. 
No freaking way! Surge!
Reading this hurts my teeth
I want P.B. Crisps back!! They were so incredible
God damnit can we get them to bring back Crystal Pepsi also?
Prices on ebay are going nuts, bids over $100 for a 12 pack right now
Can we open Vault next?
Now all they need to do is bring back those 3D Doritos. Especially the jalepeno flavor.
It's all just sugar and carbonation, both of which fuck my stomach up, HAIL COCA-COLA!
Bring Brawndo and water your farms.
Now bring "Doritos 3D" back

Finally I can justify Amazon Prime.

For a moment I read "Surge" as "Slurm".

Not sure whether to thank dyslexia, Futurama, or the crack in my phone screen.
I visited the 'World of Coca-Cola' in Atlanta.  At the end of their tour, there's a huge room with "every flavor" of soda that Coke produces around the world... but no Ecto-cooler.

So I asked one of the employees about Ecto-cooler, and she looked at me and said "*what's that?"*.  It was a sad day.
And Creepy Crawlers.
Yes! Yes! Y.E.S. Yes!   
  
there's a couple recipes online for DIY ecto-cooler, but honestly part of the magic is that it comes from those tiny little juice boxes.
And green ninja turtles vanilla pies!
I drank so much ecto-cooler in grade school.

When I opened my lunchbox and slimer was there, it was like "awww yiss!"
Am I the only person on earth that realizes Ecto-cooler was just tangerine flavored Hi-C, which YOU CAN STILL BUY? I see it on lists of things people wish still existed, and not once has anyone mentioned the fact that it still exists under a different name.
When I was stationed on Okinawa one of the craziest things to see was that Ecto-cooler never stopped being available over there. Still had Slimer on the little boxes too. It was also reasonably common at some of the fast-food places there. 

And yeah I bought a shitload of it. 
Well, if you smoke, [there's this](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ecto-cooler-e-juice-baker-vapor/) to help you quit.
I'm more hoping for Mr. Pibb.  Dr. Pepper is nice, Pibb Xtra is horrible, but if they brought back the original Mr. Pibb, wow... I'd be so happy.
Yes! ah the memories of opening up my lunch box and sucking down an Ecto cooler
Acoording to this source: http://www.foodiggity.com/a-dose-of-ephemera-ecto-cooler/ they have the same drink just re-renamed as 'Crazy Citrus Cooler,' but I don't know if it's green; I don't Hi-C anymore, but I'd figure it's probably the same orange it was originally before they did thought to do a BG tie-in.
Kind of random, but thanks for this. I used to drink (and love) Cactus Cooler and forgot the name (kind of a regional drink - I moved). You gave me the memory spark and I will find it again.
Maybe they are waiting for the next ghostbusters movie to be made
Oh I miss that awesome green liquid!

I'd murder a bus full of orphaned nuns to get Ecto-Cooler back.
I'd like a can of Storm.

[Ecto Cooler never left my friend](http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/2011/09/yes-you-can-finally-make-your-own-ecto-cooler/)
I read that as ecto-cooter and immediately went to google..all i got was a bunch of ghost busters pictures....disappointed.
I think everyone visiting it crashed the 90's server.
I love old sites like these. Reminds of the angelfire/geocities days.
Yes, especially when your dreams involve excessive amounts of sugar and morbid obesity...
okay I was born in 92, drank a fuck ton of soda in my childhood, but never remember drinking or even seeing Surge soda. I live on the East Coast of the USA, was Surge a nationwide thing? This soda came out in 97 and laste until 2003 apparently? I remember pepsi blue, and a lot of other weird shit but not Surge
Whoa whoa whoa.

Did you and your friends also buy the 25 cent Doritos sandwich crackers and little debbie snacks?

Did you also have those giant refillable soda mugs from the gas station?

Were you one of my friends?
By "be beaten back" you mean "crush Russia from both sides before the U.S. or Britain can respond", right?

...I wonder if the PC version still works.
I'm in college and used to play Axis and Allies a ton in high school. My old econ teacher even played with one of our science teachers on their off periods. Quality game!

EDIT: I should probably also add that the first time I played (UK), my friend playing Russia lost Moscow on the first turn :(
ADIDAS (All day I dream about Surge) 
I am a product of my environment.
It's Coca-Cola.  Nobody does branding like them.  Hell, they invented *Santa Claus* as we know him to day.  Nostalgia for a soft drink from childhood is nothing by their standards.  
But Filter and Orgy were pretty good...Limp Bizkit, not so much.
First, your timeline is *way* off.  Surge was released in the early mid-90's, but wasn't "big" until a few years later, before Limp Bizkit rose to fame.  

Second,  I seem to recall the shit storm raised over Coke changing recipes.  While these "kids" are excited to relive a moment from childhood, the "new Coke kids" were almost riotous.  

I am not immune to marketing, but I'm not pining for my "glory days" either.  If I see Surge at the store, of course I'll pick up a bottle/can to see if my memories match the drink or if my nostalgia shaped the taste.  I will agree that they had amazing marketing for those times.  "Extreme" was in, and Surge was way "extremer" than MD.
I just want the soda, but to each their own
True story. http://zombiefightsshark.com/2014/09/15/the-return-of-the-surge/
You hit the nail on the head. The nostalgia market right now is at it's peak and it really surprises me why more companies aren't taking advantage of that. Hopefully companies will see that with Surge selling out in a matter of hours that "there's gold in them thar hills" and we'll see a limited release of other past items. Also, your last paragraph really got the nostalgia-coaster rolling for me. I wasn't paying M:tG at the time, so I had to Google when Tempest was released and found this: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/expert/Tempest/Tempest.asp  It appears to be a forgotten page on the official WotC site from when that expansion was released. 
I have been humming My Generation all day. Well said sir!
It's Limp Bizkit!

You've been outed as not one of us!
It's not Surge's fault. It's been discontinued for like 20 years. What was the diabetic rate like 20 years ago? Maybe this will bring back those levels?  Haha
[deleted]
of course.  it's all up on ebay for double the price already.
Dude. The headline had me literally screaming "Yes!" Only to be immediately deflated once I checked. 
Not currently sold out, as of 7:06pm EDT

http://i.imgur.com/BC2wdMh.png

Apparently it gets sold out and restocked. Probably why it is listing an extra 1-2 day processing now.
Serious question - why so much nostalgia for Surge?  Wasn't it a Mountain Dew clone?  Or was it better?
Back up now. I just ordered a pack. Says they'll ship out on the 19th. Although when I added to my cart and completed the order, it said 20th. 

edit: Nvm. Sold out. Wow, I guess I was lucky.
That's okay. The better it does, the more likely they'll be to bring it back for real in brick and mortar stores.
Top 10 reasons why Surge rocks!

1. It brings back the dead
This is 100% legit for sure
/r/nosleep
No way he's sleeping through this!
I'm scared
"wimmy wam wam wozzle" 
This should be higher 
The main reason we're on top of the Human Development Index. Damn that shit tastes good
Yeah, we even got a [energy drink](http://www.brandlab.no/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Urge_case_01_lowres.jpg) that taste like heaven.
   
Am from norway and can confirm. Only difference is that its called Urge in Norway. Came back to the market a couple of years ago.
drinks these days don't have that punch, now i gotta drink 7 up for lunch. 
> I need that green, that hocus pocus focus juice, don't need a fo or a deuce, just need that surge to help me get ~~through~~ loose.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpiQiySOHE
This is the first thing I thought too
And a Bigfoot pizza?
Only if they also bring back 1-800-I-FEEL-OK.
I lived on that stuff in Jr. College.  Grilled cheese and an OK Soda at the CCC Cafeteria.  One day I remember reading the OK Soda ingredients.  I recall one stood out.  Ester of wood rosin.  "There's tree sap in my soda" I recall thinking, as I finished the can.  Don't care, loved that stuff.
Well, they are sold out now, and most of us weren't able to get any. :(
Question:Amazon is one super large mystery to me. I LOVE them but they seem to operate on fairy magic. How does one work at Amazon, do they have warehouses, and how is it that they sell EVERYTHING?
Strike that, reverse it?
I'm holding out for OK Soda.  That shit was good.
YES! Pepsi needs to bring Josta back. I loved that stuff!
This. Surge is pretty much mountain dew.  Josta was unique in it's flavor.  And as an energy drink, it tasted way better than Monster or Red Bull does now.  
Fuck off. -surge. 
I come from a somewhat taller than average family, and I'm pretty sure Josta is the reason my height never quite reached 6ft 
"It's a fully loaded citrus soda with carbos!"

Damn, there's a marketing tagline I haven't heard since middle school. Suddenly brought back a flood of memories!
Crystal Pepsi...I'd be ok with that. As long as they still use the Van Halen song as the theme song
You know, if they had made a Breaking Bad cross promo, they might have sold a lot.
Pepsi Blue, you heathen.
Damn right dude. Crystal Pepsi was awesome.
Try Not See Cola. It's basically the same formula as Crystal Pepsi, and is said to taste identical.

[You went back to September 10, 2001, and all you thought to do was bring back some Crystal Pepsi?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa53YQtdBm0)



edit: original version is something like like "Did you get to say goodbye to your dad?" but i cant find it.
But it tasted like crap. Red bull cola needs to return!

http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001IW05IQ?pc_redir=1410745809&robot_redir=1
Isn't that what plants crave?
Sorry you had to do your job.
Here here! I've been pestering Pepsi to bring back Crystal Clear Pepsi since I first got internet. I hope one day to have it again. 
I'm not sure if 90s internet was so blah, or my computer took a shit in that link.

Although I do remember waiting 30 minutes for a web page to load back in the AOL days.
Man someone gilded your for this, they must really love that shit.
Fuck yeah! 
Me, too!  Baton Rouge High School.  You?
*FREE* coupons for *FREE* Surge?!
That was the whole "Yellow no. 5 will diminish your man-berries" rumor. It was said about several sodas, but Surge was the one that caught it the worst as I recall. 
I got a Surge bucket hat, probably from the same promotion. Wore it everywhere for years. Hopefully I still have it around here somewhere.
I won the Surge walkie talkies! Still have them!
I never tried Josta, don't even remember it being around at the time, but a friend of mine raves about it. What did it taste like?
Can confirm.

http://www.savesurge.org/phoenix4.jpg this was posted in a different thread, but from that I wouldn't say exactly the same, but it's plausible the only difference is color.
Yet another reason why I wanna move to Norway.

With the help of Surge we'll get those pre-diabetes numbers down quite a bit!
I think my favorite would have to be:  
  
  
"Surge is everything about my childhood that was great. If i bowled a 100 or more with out bumpers my dad would treat me by buying me a 12 pack for the week. After Surge was discontinued he left me mom for a whore but now that its back Im going to bring him a surge and he'll love me again right? SURGE IS LOVE, SURGE IS LIFE!"
these reviews....love them. Especially the:

"My brother has been in a coma for 12 years. I whispered into his ear that they were bringing Surge back and he shot straight up, did a backflip out of bed and roundhouse kicked a nurse. 
  
The miracle is real. SUUUUUUURRRRRGGGGGEEEEE!"
"I am converting my 401k into Surge..."
Why do you not link [directly to the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/29l0c1/removing_juniper_bushes_at_work_and_found_this/cim909a?context=1) in question instead of linking to your repost of it (which is in no way in the correct subreddit by the way)?
hey, you whore. that's your comment.
Pepsi blue. 
The dream of the 90's is alive..
..*sips vanilla coke*
There are these new pop dispenser/vending machines at fast food places now that let you pick between a bunch and you can modify the drinks for more unpopular ones, vanilla Dr. Pepper, cherry Dr. Pepper etc. Well they have a vanilla coke one, boy was I excited. Tasted like pepsi with vanilla. Rarely have I been that disappointed. 

TLDR: On those custom machines go 2parts reg coke to 1part vanilla coke.
I didn't know it wasn't available everywhere.  My husband gets one every time he goes to CVS...
No no..vanilla *cherry* Coke.
Its got electrolytes, its what plants crave
YES. Dear god yes!!! Best thing I've ever had. I'm amazed at the amount of people who never had them!
Oh man I loved those so much. It was like a Dorito had a baby with a cheese puff and said offspring was more powerful than you could ever imagine...

I kinda just want the world to pretend it's the 90s/00s again. Minus the wars and Bush Jr
They're here in Thailand! 
[deleted]
They're not selling energy drinks... they're selling dreams...
heh. flat.
Zima's pretty damn refreshing, I brought as much as I could when I last went to Japan and have been saving them for special occasions.

Way better than the sticky overly sugary Smirnoff stuff.

There's one out there already! Stumbled across it online and signed it a few months ago. 
"Party on contest winners, party on" 
Well, it isn't soda, it was a Hi-C flavor. But Hi-C is owned by Coca-Cola, so.... yeah.

That Italian drink though... I will never forget it. 
They got some NASTY shit coming out of some of those fountain rotundas.
Did it have Vault or Vault Zero?  I miss the hell out of Vault Zero.  Better than Diet Mountain Dew anyday.
Ecto-Cooler wasn't a soda.
Did they have Mr. Pibb?  Not the horrible Pibb Xtra, but the honest-to-goodness-better-than-Dr.-Pepper Mr. Pibb?  If so, I might have to make a trip down to Atlanta.
I'm pretty sure we have had this available in Norway for years....only it's called [URGE...](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKuZ4xQS3wmqVvsZTJCceJXqPqEnjYRLlN1cTv4BtW2GUyYcLU) 
I would love to see a picture of that or a listing of them. I can't seem to find them.
Judging by this comment I don't believe you know the deliciousness of ecto-cooler. 
maybe try asking bill murray
I would die for some Ecto-Cooler Hi-C and some Squirt Citrus Power.
Did you try the Beverly? Oh god... the beverly.
Is that like a clown not knowing who Bozo is?

"You're hung up on some drink from the 80s man!!"
AND it has to have Slimer on it!
I don't know, my ecto cooler came in the tin cans you needed a church key for and it was still delicious.
http://www.nerdist.com/2011/09/relive-the-80s-by-making-your-own-ecto-cooler/
Your head is in the right place, sir. No lie, I have recipes for both ecto cooler and those pies in my Pocket account.
Never had one, but I will never forget begging my mom to get me one. It is truly my greatest food disappointment. 
I would pay so much money for those right now.  
Holy shit! I just started vaping a little over a month ago! I'm gonna nab some of that up right quick! Thank you so much! 
We have normal Mr. Pibb at some places here in PA (competes with Dr. Pepper) but it's pretty prevalent in VA
That's funny because they are the exact same soda.  Incredible what branding does for a product.  


Im drinking some right now. 
Pacific cooler capri sun was also a staple
Sadly, 10 years ago was 2004. Not the 90s.

Yes.

Were you in my scout troop?
Out of the box axis and allies with no house rules or a bid system. . . .Russia could crush Germany before Germany knew what happened. That is why eventually most people adopted a bid system, like I'll agree to play as the axis if I get 7 IPC's worth of units to place on the board before turn 1.

With all the new versions that have come out the balance has gotten better
If you want a PC game that simulates WWII on the same scale, but in even more detail, you should check out Hearts of Iron.  It's a series of games (the fourth of which is on the horizon) by the same people who made Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings.  HOI 3 is probably my favorite game at the moment.
The best games were when Moscow and Berlin fell within the same turn cycle and the game turned into massive tank maneuvers across Eastern Europe between Japan and the Allies.
Best Korn song for my money. 
Swallow (Surge)
[No, they didn't invent Santa Claus.](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/cocacola.asp)
First album when it was released was pretty rad at the time. After that, you're right, it slid down hill on a jet-powered toboggan.
Faith, Stuck, Counterfeit, Nookie, Break Stuff.... I'm not ashamed to say Limp Bizkit had a handful of really good songs.Ok, I'm a little ashamed. 
Filter was destined to be great, there's Nine Inch Nails in there. Orgy had what ... one or two good songs? And weren't they covers? And Limp Bizkit, well, they had a sound I'd never heard before. That first album was pretty good because they experimented with song structure. After that, they became the alpha numetal piece of shit that they continue to be today.
Surge was released in 1997, remained popular well in to 2000. $3 Bill was released in 1997 which was probably their only original (good) album.

I might be fuzzy months off, but Surge and the emergence of Limp Bizkit hover around 97-98 heydays of my youth. 

I'm surprised you didn't call me out on Korn's second album being released late '96.
> If I see Surge at the store, of course I'll pick up a bottle/can

Well you won't be buying any Surge then. It's all being sold through Amazon... as the title of this post states. 
I skipped most of my statistics classes, but I am pretty sure that this is a logical conclusion.
Surge debuted in 1996. Did they discontinue it before it launched?
Coca Cola has a lot to do with it, though.
On the other hand, we've had how many new mountain dew in the last 20 years?
It's been discontinued for like half that..... Hell, it wasn't even released originally until 18 years ago. 
No.

I hate people sometimes. I hope surge comes back in a big way and all the scalpers are left with is a lot of soda they can't sell. 
aaaand just like that it went from 1-2 days to available Sept 19 haha
At the time, most of us thought it was better. No idea if that opinion would still hold these days, though. 
mountain dew had always been around.


Surge was something different, it was sorta special to me as a child for some strange reason. The taste was great and the color was pretty awesome. We used to go bike down to the store and buy a 2L for 89c  or $1 or whatever and other snacks during the summer and play videogames or sit on the computer or whatever. It has a connection to a lot of great childhood memories
It was better.  I mean it was worse but better.

It was like drinking this super-sweet citrus-ish concoction that made your body a bit repulsed with you.  But then as soon as you swallowed, my god the after taste was like a hint of heaven.  In that shining moment you knew you needed more Surge.  
IMO, it was way better. I can't stand Mt. Dew green. (Red is okay.) But I couldn't get enough Surge back in the day.

They may have been marketed to the same crowd, but to me they taste nothing alike.

What gets me is that Coke keeps discontinuing this stuff (Surge and then Vault) in favor of pushing Mello Yello. Mello Yello also is not even remotely the same thing and tastes even _worse_ than Mt. Dew!
It wasn't a clone. It tasted different. In retrospect, I can't say if it was "better" or not, but I hope to get some and find out. I just remember drinking it a lot when I was in high school, so that's where the nostalgia comes in for me.
In all honesty, it was pretty terrible. It's nostalgia. The 90's were a strange decade full of neon extreme awesome rebellious dudes and Surge vs Jolt was a great debate in high school. For the record, I was a Surge guy, because as bad as Surge was, Jolt was completely wretched. Almost as bad as Pepsi.
I have memories of drinking it at the bowling alley with my friends. We would get slap happy hyper from it. I want that feeling back. 
Thanks Buzzfeed...

Norways economy is outperforming ours as well.  Coincidence?  Probably, but clearly Obama hasn't explored all options!
This was/is sold only in Norway? Holy crap, the rest of the world have missed out!
The BEST energy drink, holy shit so good.
It never went away. We have had it since 1996. The only thing that went away was the 0.33cl cans and the 1.5l bottles, but the 1.5l came back in 2008. The 0.5l bottles never went away though.
Its been on the market for many years as 0.5L bottles, but a couple of years ago they started selling the 1.5L bottles again.
Hence the s in parenthesis.
Hey! Do you wanna do a trade or something? I could send you some American-exclusive snacks and you could send me some (S)Urge and other treats from your country?

Or... Does any other Norwegian out there? 
I think this has the potential to be pretty cool. PM me if interested!
I know that there is a subreddit for this but I can't for the life of me think of what it's called! :(


YES! 

And then get Little Caesar's to bring back the Big Big Cheese and Domino's to bring back the Dominator, for a return to the early '90s battle of gigantic pizza superiority. 
My mom still talks about that Bigfoot pizza. 
Awesome. I thought I was the only one on earth who remembered that.
No worries. Amazon had a limit on how much they could sell in the first day. Should be available again tomorrow. 
There are warehouses in a lot of countries. In  the US it's mostly in the east side of the country. The FC (fulfillment center) is pretty much a huge storage building. 3 floors and and other areas full of random items. I'm a picker, so I'm constantly going around and picking your order(s). We walk around 15 miles or more a shift. I'm actually at work right now, so I have to go.  If you have any  questions, then ask! I'll answer some we I'm on lunch break.

Nah, let it ride... 

Let's see where this will take us.

Holy shit dude Josta was the shit!!! Also Crystal Pepsi.That shit was awesome too.

Hell. Yes.

NAZI!
Thank you! I found out about  crystal Pepsi after I moved to United States,  and they had stopped making it by then. I found out about it because a friend of my friend had an unopened bottle in collection and for some reason the clear cola concept made me want to try it real bad. Thanks to you now I will be able to. Off to Amazon! 

Edit: Thanks to spending time in reddit I saw the name Not see cola and read it as Nazi cola.  
There is absolutely no way I'm buying anything with that label. I don't care if it's the nectar of eternal life.

Whoever's behind their marketing is an idiot.
If you guys are starting a movement you should probably know that it was called Crystal Pepsi, not Crystal Clear Pepsi.
[Here's a link to the not crappy version of the page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M2OGS08). Currently sold out though. 
Ahhh yes... that's it!  I could vaguely recall it had something to do with one of the ingredients.  Doesn't make sense why Surge was singled out.  Maybe it was Mountain Dew smear campaign lol.
Nice! hhaha
Are the labels on most consumer goods printed in English or is it just because it's an American product?
The flavors are so realistic, too! The Triple Rush tasted exactly like a real triple rush!
Surge is good, and Serj. Wake up!
...I don't know what the hell I'm doing. 

That's why.
It's a piss-poor attempt to karma whore.
/u/polkaaudio hints that his leak is [part of the online marketing campaign itself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/29l0c1/removing_juniper_bushes_at_work_and_found_this/cimd142)
I just blended a can of vanilla coke zero and cherry coke zero and I must say it tastes like America.
Coke Vanilla Zero is the best god damn coca-cola there is. 
They also cross contaminate like a motherfucker. I can't stand going to places that have those now because every time I get a regular Coke it tastes like complete ass. In fact it all tastes like ass. Hints of orange, vanilla, cherry, and god knows what else, it's gross. 
If anything, having a surge made you even more tired, because you always had to scream, "SUUUUUUUUURRRRRRGE!" and then sprint across an alley with a bunch of couches and furniture on the way just to get one. 
We have (s)Urge energy drinks in Norway... I just bought one today! :) 
An energy drink version exists in norway, where it's called "Urge Intense" http://www.coca-cola.no/nordic-corp/cc/no_NO/pages/products/urgeintense.html
But the Surge worked

What exactly *is* Beverly anyways? 

It tasted like soap mixed with cloves and other herbs. 
Oh, but that sweet sweet [VegitaBeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VegitaBeta)
Yeah. I went there a few weekends ago and machine gunned every single tap. There were some I tasted where I had to stop, process them for a few seconds, and shake them off before I could continue.
Oh man how did I forget about Vault? I loved it so much.
You mean "Surge wannabe" ? 
Mr. Pibb is good but nothing beats Dr.pepper...
If it doesn't have Slimer on it, I'm not buying it :)

We did do scouts...
I read along amused until you said scout troop.  Playing axis and allies at lock ins must have been some unwritten merit badge.
There are new versions? What does it change?  I would be very interested to know because this was a favorite game of mine to play as a young lad. However, many of the games ended up the same so we definately instituted some house rules. 

One time we allowed the units to be placed where ever we wanted on our territories. 

We would typically allow an extra infantry unit or tank on a transport ship as well. 

I also remember us doing something with the submarine combat mechanics at dome point but i can't remember. I Def wanna see what they have done with the game since.  I yearn for a better computer version as well. 

Russia could crush Germany? Care to elaborate or give me some links, with the old version of Axis & Allies I saw the Russians always as the weakest force, doomed to produce soldiers and a tank here and there to hold back Germany as long as possible. We never let anyone new to the game get Russia, as usually they would loose quite fast to Germany and be out of the game.
I just watched a tutorial and this looks awesomely detailed. However, it also looks like something I would sink way too many hours into. 
My secret move was to have the USA spend heavily on secret weapons early in the game.  It was always fun to nuke the crap out of Germany every turn.
Even better! People are under the illusion that they invented the modern description of Santa. The company remains silent on the matter, and thus Coca-Cola further cements itself in the public consciousness in even the smallest of discussions.
I popped in an LB album about a month ago on a road trip with my wife. I'm sad to report that it indeed sucked ass.

No, it was around for a few years.

I was king of the office the next day passing out twinkies and devil dogs to the unwashed masses. 
>Coke said it may expand the drink to other retailers and add to the campaign, depending on how consumers react. 

I'd assume that selling out of stock will be taken as a good reaction.
Maybe apple was hired for product distribution?
I think half the reason was because it had so much caffeine in it, you'd get hopped up quick. 
Plus growing up, there was always an urban legend that a kid drank a whole case and died from a heart attack. So that made it more badass. 
It was *twenty-five cents*.  Even us poor kids could scrape together $0.25 a couple times a week.  That's what made it better than Dew.
So it's like Slurm from Futurama?

The marketing in an interesting way was kind of ahead of it's time. I guess we were in one of the test markets for it, but it seems like not many people had exposure. 

Tasted pretty good too.
What time did they go on sale today? I'm just going to get up and sit at my computer and wait.

Dammit why is it sold out
http://www.amazon.com/surge works too.
The [questions and answers](http://www.amazon.com/Surge-16-FL-OZ-Cans/forum/Fx21VK7WJDX8YAW/-/1/ref=cm_cd_dp_aar_ql?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B00M2OGS08&cdSort=best) on it's Amazon page are hilarious.  
I think it started as some kind of mom campaign against Surge (because it 
was/is pretty bad for you) and then it went kind of haywire. But I have no source to back that up in any way. 
The schnozberries taste like schnozberries!

Hey, at least you're honest.
Damn Canadians, always blending things.
How hard is it to do 0.5 seconds of water, then water+syrup, then follow each press with 0.5 seconds of water to keep the lines clear?  Sounds like it would be easy to design these to prevent cross contamination.
Just a bit of history with a happy ending: 'Ecto-cooler' was renamed 'Shoutin' Orange Tangergreen' in 2001, and renamed again in 2006 to 'Crazy Citrus Cooler'. In 2007, 'Crazy Citrus Cooler' was discontinued and is no longer being sold. 

Luckily, the boys down in Ghostbusters: Chicago Division, came up with a [homemade replica-formula](http://ghostbusterschicago.com/content/ecto-cooler-recipe). This recipe is said to "taste exactly like the original".

I have learned to take shots of Beverly without making a face to convince newcomers to try it and watch the reaction they have.  It brings me happiness.  
That shit almost ruined my trip to Epcot.
Anything like [Moxie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie)?
Is it like a Coke-branded chinotto? Man, that shit tastes just like a more bitter version of cough medicine.
I moved to ATL after I was done with college for close to 6 years. One of the clearest memories I have from that time was going to the World of Coke with my friends. They built up how wonderful Beverly is and how it was going to be life changing. They all watched with looks amusement as I took my first sip. Bastards.
I miss vault. I used to mix equal parts Vault, Sprite, and blue Powerade to create the best soda ever. It tasted like the mega evolution of Baja Blast Mountain Dew.
It was basically Surge without the OJ in it.

Surge had less caffeine than Mountain Dew. It was the marketing campaign that made everyone think that it got you hopped up, which is 1) why it was so popular, and 2) ironically what got it pulled from the shelves.
Urban legend around my area about Surge was that it made your balls smaller and lowered your sperm count.
Virtually the same amount of caffeine and sugar as Mountain Dew. I think the hype is mainly due to the nostalgia as it's been discontinued (until today) for like 13 years so in most people's minds, Surge is synonymous with childhood and the 1990s. Plus it was bright green! And the commercials were epic!
They put a $0.25 surge machine ing high school. Unlike the other coke machines, it didn't shut down during the lunch periods. 

I never did really like it but it was cheap.

Cmon guys, Ecto Cooler is still sold as Orange Tangerine Juicy Juice. Minus the green food coloring, of course.
The original name in the 80's was Citrus Cooler, then around the 2nd Ghostbusters movie they renamed it Ecto-cooler.

There are few things I want more in my life than the return of Oreo-O's
I've heard that you can get them if you have connections to South Korea. Apparently they are still produced and sold there.
Me too! I loved these things! They made the milk so good
More of a 4chan thing really.  They kept calling Gamestop and asking to preorder Battletoads.  More recently, they repeatedly called Pawnstars to ask for it.

Back when I worked at Disney World, we used to try to convince kids that drinking 40 Beverly shots in a row won that person a free t-shirt.  

It was the College Program.  We were poor.  Entertainment had to be found somewhere.
And now I have a new life mission. I must master this.
I do this too. It's a rite of passage. So much fun to do to my friends / family. 
The only drinks that take its taste out of your mouth are the Asian ones. The Chinese and Japanese drinks will remove that shit flavor that the Italian drink leaves. 
Going to Epcot in October, where can this drink be found?!
I've actually had the displeasure of drinking both Moxie and Beverly. Full disclosure that I abhor bitter tasting things so my opinion of both is entirely negative. Moxie was worse.
Are they gonna have a female slimer, too?
Whoa...troop 376?!  

Nope, not anywhere near there. Sorry to disappoint, reddit. Northwest Illinois for me.

We're just the same person.

Is that what I missed out on by never joining the scouts?
its been awhile, and I believe they have an even newer version out now... but I have the Original, and the 2005-06 version... 

They changed the map. They made a huge dead zone (no movement through it) in Africa for the Sahara. They Redistricted most of the boarder between the German and Russian fronts.

They also added in Sub Destroyer ships, and Forward Artillery that buffed your infantry when defending.

I just bought that Juicy Juice last week and it's nothing like Ecto Cooler!  It's pretty sweet but not saccharine sweet like the Hi C.  We need the original back.
But is there a fucking Slimer on the box? IS THERE?!?
I'm going to the grocery after my A&P test... If you are wrong I will find you...

Is this about that box in your closet with Cleveland on it?
As long as Reeses Puffs are on the shelf, I will survive.
Aren't they still sold in Worst Korea?
Those and French Toast Crunch. I haven't been able to find that for YEARS.
The return of Rice Krispie Treats cereal to all major grocery stores?
Yep. I'm currently living in SK. I feel like an international Oreo O's dealer, because I'm constantly sending packages of them back to the US to anyone who requests them.

Me and my best friend got a heads up that Pepsi Blue was being discontinued. So we pooled our money together and bought as much as we could. Luckily one of the grocery stores in town was having a big sale on it. 2 dollar twelve packs and 75 cent two litres. We had enough to last us another 6 monthes. I miss that blue sludge :-(

A much better thing to do would be to label what pesticides, hormones and antibiotics your food is grown with and fed with.
From the comments it seems people are very misinformed about GMO products. **Genetically modifying a crop doesn't carry any more risk to health than selectively breeding**. We've been selecting for desirable traits in plants for thousands of years, improving what we grow while narrowing the genetic diversity of the crop. The only difference is now instead of cross pollinating plants to combine traits we desire, now we can isolate genes that yield those traits and make exactly what we want without having to worry about cross-pollinating multiple generations of plants to isolate the traits we want.

People don't need to know, and I quote another post in this thread, "that a product contains GMO", any more than they need to know that what they're eating contains products that were selectively breed for traits that seem to be yielding a more desirable crop.

Do companies that create GMO's enforce convoluted and unfair policies regarding the proprietary nature of the products they create? Absolutely, and these companies are taking advantage of flawed laws to milk money from honest farmers. **But let's not scare people away from GMO crops because of the shitty practices of the companies that produce them.** 

The biggest risk in relying on GMO crops for food is the fact that all plants in any given crop are genetically identically and susceptible to being wiped out by any single external factor. It's happened before and it will happen again, but genetic modification is becoming more sophisticated all the time and modifying the genetic structure of a crop can prevent the next yield from dying. **The risk in growing GMO food is held by the grower, not the consumer.**

If you agree that GMO corporations are abusing our flawed intellectual property laws then **write your local representatives and tell them what is wrong and how it can be fixed**, but don't use that as an excuse to scare people away from an amazing product.

Final (hopefully) edit: I guess in the issue of fairness I should give some specifics about the downside of GMO companies regarding intellectual property laws. Intellectual property is an important concept because intangible thoughts and ideas are often the result of tangible investments in time and money. Theoretically copyrights exist on genetic information to allow companies that deal in the research and development of genetically modified organisms to benefit from the result of their risky R&D investments. This is similar to the way in which pharmaceutical companies are allowed to copyright drug formulas for a period of time to reap the benefit of their work. The problem is the amount of time a company may hold a copyright for an organism (20 years, per http://www.thehastingscenter.org/publications/briefingbook/detail.aspx?id=2174), which may become a major problem if any single patented crop becomes a large enough part of our food production. Giving a single entity propriety control over resource like food without necessary oversight may present a problem in the future, and could possible lead to companies driving up food prices similar to how pharmaceutical companies are able to drive up drug prices. It's hard to find any current issues regarding biological copyright law regarding GMO's, but if you know of any I encourage you to post them out of both personal interest and intellectual honesty.

TL;DR: Awesome video courtesy of /u/IGDetail that summarizes some of the important points http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIvNopv9Pa8&feature=youtu.be
I don't really care about GMO. I want caffeine amounts to be clearly listed. 
I'm ok with this, honestly. The entire idea of labeling food with GMO's is retarded. It does nothing to actually inform the consumer. All it does is create fear and paranoia over nothing, and all it will accomplish is spawn another overpriced fad diet scheme of "GMO FREE FOODS!" which are already starting to crop up.

There's nothing biologically wrong with eating GMO crops. Many, many studies have confirmed this. 

If you take issue with the ethical side of things based on the business practices of Monsanto or "big agri", that's fine, but you're in such a small minority that you should be willing to take on the responsibility of researching products that you want to avoid, not asking for a label that will do nothing but cause fear and confusion.
Maybe someone could lobby to have reasonable portion sizes on our food labels?  
A can of soup shouldn't have 33% of my daily intake of sodium but be 2 servings.  

It's *one can* of soup!
Brit here, I don't really understand the US political system.



Does "Lobby" mean "give senators money to vote in my company's favour"? If not, what are they 'spending heavily' on?
To food companies....just label the product does NOT have GMO and let people decide. This fight actually reminds me of the RSBT fight with Kroger grocery stores. Kroger would put on their milk RSBT free. The milk group sued them because they were not required to put that on the label. Kroger  indicated in court it was simple marketing and people wanted RSBT free milk. The warning was not required but Kroger did it anyway for sale. Once Walmart said they did not want RSBT milk.....the entire market changed.

The other side of the GMO issue is not whether it's safe, but is okay for several mega-corporations to control the seed market and world agriculture?
In other news, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Nestle are all heavily invested in genetically modified foods.
Oh so Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Nestle actually believe in modern science and understand that all the fear of GMO is completely unfounded ignorance?  
  
Good to know, thanks for the update.
As a Washingtonian who works with organic farmers quite a bit, I still oppose this bill.

I'm not necessarily for GMO, but the attacks against them are often driven by bad science instead of sound thought. 

More importantly, this bill is nothing but noise. If it labeled which ingredients were GMO on the ingredients instead of giving it a modified skull and cross bones that labels it as dangerous and something to avoid. Give information instead of a warning.

GMOs have very positive uses and we need to treat them with a nuanced attitude that accepts there are problems with monocultures, but also embraces their positives. This bill does not do it.

Just because big business doesn't support something doesn't mean we HAVE to support it. We need a more nuanced view than just black and white.
If this law passes, almost all cheeses (anything with rennet that is produced microbially, even many "organic" cheeses use this enzyme but use "organically farmed" milk for certification) and soy sauce would also be labeled. Not too mention whipped dairy products, ice creams, coffee creamer and salad dressings(most of which contain xanthan gum produced microbially). Geletan and agar are possible contenders. Chocolate undergoes a fermentation stage, so do some coffees. These fermenations are often time consuming and expensive using native organisms. With the advantages in genetics, why would a company pay more to use a less efficient organism that is filtered out of the final product anyway? Perhaps even bakers and brewers yeast and many vinegars come from bacteria/fungi engineered for high ethanol tolerance. Most vitamins added to your flour are certified to be produced microbially. That means your Lucky Charms with "12 essential vitamins" used products of a modified Streptomyces. And that beef you bought? Sure, it's probably just naturally breed, but what about the arginine supplements in its feed that bring it to market faster? Those were produced at a big Cargil fermentation refinery.  Oh, and lets not forget modern medicine too. How many reactions for pharmeceuticals are done in modified bacteria or with proteins from those bacteria.   
   
So before you get on your high-horse about how bad "artificial" tomatoes are, consider that your entire way of life is dominated by modified cultures, and almost none of you who shop at a supermarket can claim that you live only on "natural" foods.

http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/MicroorganismsMicrobialDerivedIngredients/default.htm
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Biotechnology/ucm096095.htm (IIRC FDA says that any product produced by "bioengineered" organisms used as a food ADDITIVE is permitted as long as it is indistinguishable from other ADDITIVES already regarded as safe or if it passes FDA approval for safety)
Wow. Is this really on the front page?
I don't have a problem myself with the idea of genetically modified foods, nor do I believe as of yet they present significantly more or less risk than any other food. However, I definitely support labeling them.

It's simply a matter of access to information. Even though I have no issue with GMOs, that doesn't mean there aren't other people who oppose them and would like to be able to avoid such products.

It's just a matter of providing that information so people can decide for themselves what they want to do. I support any labeling that would provide more information to consumers about what they are buying, not just limited to GMOs. Yes, some people will respond irrationally to things they don't understand, but it's their right to do so, and it shouldn't preclude providing as much information as possible to help make an informed purchase.
About the big evil Monsanto:  I am a farmer who buys GMO seed from Monsanto.  My experience with them has been nothing but good.  They have simple kick-back programs if you farm with newer technologies (GPS guidence, auto steer, etc.) and give massive discounts on seed price if you end up in a flood and need to replant (happened to me this year).  Most importanly my yeilds were great.  I grew up thinking they were the devil's right hand but so far I have seen nothing but good things for us farmers.  Sure, we sign a contract that states we cannot save seed to plant next year or else they will come after your crop but pretty much all seed companies do this.  

The ability to lobby, in my opinion, is not the fault of the companies that have the money to do so.  It is our fault.  We've allowed our government to have this system and if there's one thing I've noticed in my life its that once a part of government has begun it usually just grows and grows....like my crops :-) 
[deleted]
Lobbying can be bad, but I wonder if there's a legitimate need to educate lawmakers on technical details or specific business needs. How do you legitimately provide the 200+ lawmakers the information that they need to make an appropriate decision?
Judging by the content of the comments on thread, it would seem as some of that money is being spent defending GMO on Reddit. I see the impacts of Monsanto on farmers, its infiltration into federal government, its ability to write its own regulations, and its general corruption. I know local organic farmers and I know their positive impact on our community.
That's so strange, I just found a new list of companies to avoid. They're making kicking the sweet habit easy.
Food companies rule Washington. Just look at food stamps and how the government subsidizes these companies and the farms they run and screws the farms trying to provide healthy and cheap food alternatives. Wanna know what is crushing the healthcare system look to obesity and the poison these places sell. 
Well, it's money that's been well spent, obviously. This thread is jam-packed with astroturfers and sheep/idiots who are convinced that everything they do is beneficial and benign without the slightest question, so job well done to those companies. 

You're still going to lose at the polls, but it seems you've bought some fans at least.  I'm sure they'll enjoy choking down your gmo products for many years.
I'm glad people are increasingly in favor of labeling. It's important to know what you're eating, regardless if it's safe.
No shit sherlock. If people were taking measures to destroy your business, I would hope that all of you would have the brains to do everything within your power to stop it. 
First, a concerning number of studies sponsored by corporations with an interest in GMOs - the studies that are used to determine whether individual products make it to shelves - have been favorable to GMOs, while independent studies tend to have results more critical of GMOs. 

Second, it's circular logic to say GMOs are safe because nobody gets sick from them, if they aren't labeled. Currently, people don't have the option of saying to their doctor, "I ate this GM tomato and had a really bad reaction," or to look more broadly at their diet and compare a personal diet with GMOs to one without in order to compare the differences. Without labeling there is no traceability to illness caused by them. If they're as safe as agribusiness corporations tell us, they should have no fear about them being labeled because it will just prove their safety on a much larger scale than has been done through testing. 

Whether you think people who consciously choose to avoid GM products are ignorant or not (hint: not all of them do it because they think they'll get sick - some just don't want to support the shameful business practices of industrial agriculture, or they'd rather not take a chance in case GMOs do prove to be harmful), failure to label a major component of a food product forces something concerned citizens don't want for whatever reason down their throats. It's just not that easy to avoid GM food, especially for older generations who are less tech-savvy. And an overwhelming percentage of Americans (upwards of 90%) say they want labeling when asked, so if the democratic process in state legislatures hadn't been hijacked this wouldn't even be an issue.

Finally, on what Reddit seems to believe is the slim, slim chance that GMOs could ever be harmful to humans or the environment after all, why allow our entire food supply to be contaminated with these modified genes as it is without making a better effort to preserve heirloom varieties just in case? Labeling would help create a stronger divide between what is natural and time-tested and what is modified.

Edit: spelling.
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
its in just about everything and pretty much all corn grown in North America or Europe is genetically modified. Monsanto cornered this market years ago and if anyone in the developed world doesnt want to be eating and drinking genetically modified organisms they should have stopped going to the grocery store in the 90s
I'll be ok when the people who want GMOs labeled are ok with farmer's market food that must be labeled 'THIS FOOD HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR CONSUMPTION BY THE USDA.'
Given the unfounded irrational fear of GMO's, labelling requirements are like a subsidy to non-GMO companies. 
How the fuck did we let giant chemical companies take over our food industry? 
It makes total sense that these companies are blocking the labeling as it would no doubt add negativity to there branding, or additional costs in sourcing products.

In relation to consumer safety, Science tries its best to prove the point required by the person commissioning the research. This is one of the major downfall of non-pure science using the authority of pure science.
There is no evidence GMO's do anything, good or bad.  
Damn you Coke (takes a swig of Coca-Cola) Damn you to hell!

Joking aside, it will be absurd if they side with the companies showing that they care about them more than the American people. What is depressing is I won't be surprised at all if they do side with the companies.
I don't know about you guys but I enjoy reading all of the labels on my food. The more science the better. There should be a barcode that I can scan on all of my food that will provide me with a detailed documentary of the manufacturing process as well as a library of links to all of the relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature.

Label GMOs - definitely. I'd like the entire gene sequence of the organism provided and how it differs from ancestral lines.

Why? Because reading science is cool and why should the scientists involved in its creation have all the fun to themselves?
I would prefer there to be national labeling requirements.  
In realty the labeling won't effect costumer consumption of products like cola....   WE AREN'T STUPID WE KNOW COLA IS BAD AND WE DRINK IT ANYWAY!
Friend's brother has just been involved in releasing this app http://buycott.com/

You can scan a product and see the political affiliations of the company, including who and what they've donated.
As a dairy farmer, I would imagine most everything made with corn would use GMO seed. You really can't blame the farmers,  it's near impossible to grow decent corn without GMO seed, tons of fertilizer and herbicides.  Really, the main difference is the GMO seed is Round-Up Ready and the conventional seed is not.  In my opinion,  Round-up is less harmful to the environment than the alternatives (think Atrizene and the malformed frogs).  This year, I stopped growing corn and grew sorghum instead.  Non GMO, non-treated seed with no fertilizer or herbicide, much easier and WAY less expensive to grow.  My milk would still need to be labeled GMO though,  because I'm sure much of the grain I buy from the feed company contains GMO corn and soy.

That is fucked up when a company is against public disclosure of the ingredients in their food.  
Really fucked up.  
from seattle. voted for labeling food with gmo. is it going to keep me from buying foods with gmo. no. but i think it's good to at least know what i'm buying.
I have the right to know and choose what I'm putting into my body and chemical make up you corporate assholes. I don't care how much it "costs," you. 
GMOs are not the threat from those companies; it's sugar. Let's address the most obvious problem first, mmkay?
All that money corporations are pouring into this fight and reading through these comments makes me wonder if they are hiring trolls to comb the internet and make pro-GMO comments, etc.
Here's an idea: How about label food that is NOT GMO with a label that says "NOT GMO"

That way, people that care about GMO can buy products from makers that are similarly like minded. 

PS. the reason this is bad to do on a state level is because it means every state will have a different requirement and suddenly it will be illegal (yes, illegal) to bring Mac and Cheese labeled for sale in Oregon into the state of California, for example. 

we've all seen the stupid sticker on a ladder that says "the state of CA has determined this product contains materials known to the state of CA to cause cancer." It's odd when you see that in Denver. But such is life when states get crazy. Do you want 50 stickers on your ladder, each one specifying how each state feels about the product? I sure don't.

So, if we must, the let's do it nationally. But state by state is stupid. And the smartest solution is to let each product brag they are NOT GMO if so inclined. 
If GMO's are not only benign, but *beneficial*, as many of the comments in this thread suggest, why would labeling foods made with GMO's be a bad thing? 



If there are no peer-reviewed studies purporting the harmful effects of GMO use and consumption, wouldn't that be a positive thing for a company to use in their promotional materials? 



One point that has come up repeatedly is that the consumers should do their research, find out which foods use GMO's, and if they take issue with the practice simply not purchase said foods. On the flipside, isn't the burden of proof on the companies that use GMOs themselves? Shouldn't it be their job to tell me about their product and how it is perfectly safe for my own consumption, as opposed to spending millions of dollars preventing legislation that would inform me if the product contains GMO?



Sure, there may be a temporary drop in sales if the all products containing GMO's are labelled as such. If that trend continued forever [*and let's be honest, it most likely would not, while it's no longer fringe but considered trendy to be gluten free the majority of Americans are not on gluten free diets nor do they need to be (http://www.celiaccentral.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/)*] the companies themselves would simply stop using GMO's to meet their consumer's demands. 
Remember that word democracy? When 93% of Americans want GMO labelling you better give them fucking GMO labelling. Science has still to provide LONG-TERM results of GMO foods and some science DOES say it is bad. This is just a rational option for the people who want it. How dare anyone say that we dont get to choose what we eat or see. Its a transparency issue the most.
Harmful or not, we need to know how our food was produced. There is NO HARM in labeling. 
I noticed these same companies, along with Montesano(sp?) have put millions of $$ toward stopping this.  I dont get it. Recently they did same thing in California and blocked the bill.

1. i think we should label it, why not. Companies change their labels all the time.
2. why are they spending so much if not out of fear, seems fishy.
3. i would still eat GMO stuff.
There are a host of reasons not to consume these products, the least of which is that they contain GMOs. If people are too stupid to not recognize a shit ton of corn syrup and sugar are incredibly bad for them, they will not care about a stupid GMO label.
I work with GMOs and have would have no problem eating them. I do however think that people have a right to know and a right to chose so products should be labelled.

Genetically modified organisms has, like, 12 syllables and sounds like science!  It _must_ be bad!
They shouldn't be labelled, imo, it's crackpot science saying they are bad for us. And forcing the labeling GMOs etc is just going to hurt the small farmers who can't label their goods...and thus will be scrutinized by the FDA, it won't at all effect the huge corporate farms at all. I would love to know who is lobbying for this crackpot nonsense? Or how they get away with it but global warming deniers don't, or vaccine deniers get more sympathy. This new stream of crack pot science is vastly more damaging than those who think evolution isn't real, that has no effect on anyone other than who believes it...this line of crack pot science that, in the end, wants to ban GMOs essentially dooms the very poorest of countries by making them fear scientifically enhanced foods and virtually taking food from their mouths. It's disgusting.
There have been zero legitimate research studies claiming GMO foods are inherently dangerous.  Don't bother using logic with the hipster foodies though.
Ahh, another GMO thread where I can listen to 99% of people who have never grown a single plant talk about what we are doing wrong!

Okay okay, some people have an idea here. However, most people here  are just spewing whatever they heard someone repeat last that sounded good last time this thread came up and on and on and on.

Shit people arguing about how bad round-up and how bad round-up ready crops are because it is so deadly and they don't even realize its NOT EVEN A PESTICIDE!  
I'm not worried about GMOs it's just loony fear mongering. I'm more concerned about the amount of salt, sugar and additives added to food.
It *is* Washington, so are is the marijuana going to have to be labelled as a GMO with every little change in whatever strain?
Time to stop eating and drinking that crap.... Easier said than done tho 
I'm an ignorant consumer who would prefer to not eat foods which carry a health risk. Despite the overwhelming opinion here that I have nothing to fear, i suspect there are some uncertainties to have caused the controversy. Also, I am very suspicious of the lobbyists who represent the powerful companies who'll profit from GMO.

It seems to me that if there's nothing to fear there should be no reason not to label. Knowing it's not being sold but not labeled reduces trust. I wonder if the suppliers motives for avoiding labels are the same as those of redditors'. 

When it comes to BIG food/BIG Pharma/BIG anyone with inordinate amounts of money:

I picture these white wrinkled, old, spit-laden lips saying, "Let them eat cake," in some accent (I'll let you fill in which one).

In place of "Let them eat cake" you can fit all sorts of things like:

"Let them eat GMO" (as we eat "natural", fresh, nutrient rich foods and vegetables cut by hand, with golden shears, by our very own well payed, indentured servants, I mean, ehem, growers. 

or

"Let them use the old meds" (as we and our families and close croonies get the best, advanced medical intervention. You know, stuff that you have been hearing for years is on its way to your nearest doctor's office ....eventually)

"Let them drink water from rusty bacteria ridden pipes" (as we use bottled, soft-water even when washing our pets and/or clothes). 

It goes on and on and in my mind, in the end, there will be just be like a small village of these stinking rich people (won't need more as they can make more humans in the lab should they need to) who survive the environmental apocalypse-sitting there on their couches made of cashmere, while drinking 500 old alcohol (not sure what filthy rich people drink that lasts that long so) and reminiscing about how cute the savages were back then. 

  sorry I don't buy not labeling products . Round up in a gmo corn I'd kind of want to know.  How hard it is to label ?. A bar code for your cell to read or a website that has all the content IF YOU ARE TOO CONCERNED OVER THE Fraction of a penny it costs to print the ingredients......
People have the right to know what they're buying is GMO food or not.

Let people have the right to vote with their wallets what they buy. This is like making it illegal to have "Made in China" on on the product.
They can modify the shit out of organisms, as long as their approach doesn´t harm living test objects or the consumers.
[deleted]
Well, those three (and almost every other producer) use High Fructose Corn Syrup.  They would have to label everything that does.  And that pretty much means everything sweet.

My issue with GMO isn't the modification.  That is likely to be a safe as any other food product and, sometimes, it might even be safer.  My problem with GMO is that manufacturers like Monsanto have a strong fiscal incentive to have all corn or soybeans crops be their corn and their soybeans.

And bio diversity in our food sources be damned.


... spending heavily in Washington state and also apparently on Reddit shills ...
of course they are.  they've been feeding poison to us for generations and made billions in the process. why would they want to stop now?
This is inherently bad for farmers and industry alike.

Imagine you are a producer of organic foods.  You don't use GMO seeds, but the farmer who owns the fields next to you does.  A few bees land on his crops,  pick up some pollen,  then fly over to your field. 

To you're knowledge,  there is no GMO used in your products,  so you don't have to label them.  Then someone trays your product for GMO. Because your crops were cross pollinated from your neighbor's GMO crops,  you get dimmed with heavy penalties for not labeling your products that now contain GMO genetic material without any control or contributing action from you other than the fact that you farm beside sometime who does use GMO.

This is a real danger for this kind of legislation.  

Now imagine a food company pays a farmer to use 40% of his land to grow crops for them.  My company does this kind of thing.  One of the contractual obligations is that the farmer does not use GMO products or dangerous chemicals in that 40% of his land.  On the other 60%, he can grow what he likes add he likes.  So he users GMO with various pesticides to grow vegetables to sell at market. 

The same scenario plays out as above,  and now the food manufacturer is being punished under the law,  despite contractual adherence to no GMOs on that 40% of the land

Or maybe birds pick up seeds from the GMO fields and accidentally drop them in the organic fields. Organic fields are easily compromised without human control,  is basically the point.  Outside of laboratory testing of every piece of produce coming out of a field,  there is no way of knowing what is GMO vs non-GMO, even with organic crops.  

Life finds a way,  and everyone gets hurt by this law because biology will continue to do is birdy beezy plant sexy thing,  and there is virtually no way to know our predict whether crops intended to be organic are truly organic without laboratory genetic testing, which most food producers simply cannot afford to perform.

The end result will not be that consumers are better informed about organic vs GMO crops,  but instead less,  as it will ultimately become more practical for ALL farmed goods to be labeled as containing GMO material,  because it will be cheaper ultimately to change the packaging and marketing than it is to risk paying fines on crops from organically grown plasma that just happen to have been cross-pollinated from GMO plants.

I've studied the controversies around this bill in Washington and it's extremely complicated. A lot of people have already covered quite a bit of information about it, but I have a few things to add.

First, this bill is written largely by coalition of organic farmers and representatives of organic grocery stores here in Washington like Terra Organica. Imagine the economic benefit that they will experience if people are scared into purchasing products that are not genetically engineered? This includes a huge number of their products that already contain the ["Non-GMO Label"](http://www.nongmoproject.org/) which is a voluntary label that *already* labels GE products. Also, there is already a label that specifically includes non-GMO products, and that label is organic. In Washington, in order for foods to be able to be labeled organic they must not be produced with GE ingredients. So there are already *two* labels that can be used to signal a foods non-GMO status, the difference being that one is mandatory while the other two (that I just covered) are voluntary.

Second, imagine the effect this could have on the scientific study of genetic engineering in crop science. I understand some take issue with the economic backers of this bill, myself included, but they pay for quite a bit of the research surrounding the genetic engineering of our crops. Certainly if we force them into a corner they won't have as much interest in funding many of these scientific studies to better understand GE products. 

Last, the bill seems comprehensive, but it is not. Many products like cheese, alcohol and many others will be exempt from the law, meaning they won't have to be labeled GE, but they're made with GE ingredients. WTF is up with that? Isn't that misleading as fuck for consumers? And it's because these products are already exempt from our current labeling system. Wtf.
Why don't you start labeling food that is NOT made with genetically modified organisms? Why do you need a law for this? 
[deleted]
Good, they're preventing idiotic panic and future shady Naked Juice style branding tactics. Why isn't paying extra for something labeled "organic" or shopping at whole foods enough for you people?
If it wasn't for GMO there would be a huge amount of people starving to death this days... 

The modifications is what allows we to cultivate faster, bigger, and more. It allows people to harvest food in harsher environments. I remember watching Bullshit! about it, and how basically they talked that you couldn't feed the world if you used no-GMO.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIvNopv9Pa8
That's because it's a fucking retarded idea. Almost everything would be marked, and half the shit that claims not to be is! Back in college I majored in Biotechnology, in one of our labs we tested a bunch of these "organic" & "all natural" products. Only 2 of the ten didn't have GMO product.
I would eat GMO foods any day. It is just food. 

Now, soft drinks? that is NOT FOOD. 
Seriously, no one cares you eat genetically modified food daily and you are fine. Hundreds of studies support this as well.

http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/10/08/with-2000-global-studies-confirming-safety-gm-foods-among-most-analyzed-subject-in-science/#.UnEuf3m9LCQ



The biggest problem I'm seeing in this thread right now is no one seems to know the difference between GMO and transgenic foods, secondly everything you have ever eaten ever is a GMO yes even organic food, your cat or dog is a GMO, selective breeding is genetically modifying an organism. 
Anyone who is against labeling needs to be monkey stomped.  Who the hell are you tell me that its not relevant information?  It's my right to decide what information is relevant to me, not yours.
In most countries there are laws requiring the labeling of GMOs and the companies haven't gone broke.  The people fighting this so hard are very suspect. 
Good. GMOs are harmless and the last thing we need is another scare tactic to keep us from scientific progress.
Err on the side of too much information.
Or you know, factors that are proven by an independent body to be in any way dangerous in quantities considered.
*This product has not been genetically modified. But has been sprayed with x-amounts of pesticides to meet the quality standards of consumers.*
> A much better thing to do would be to label what pesticides, hormones and antibiotics your food is grown with and fed with.

This would be great if people were intelligent enough to know what to do with this information. Most people are pretty scared when it comes to ANY chemical sounding name, no matter how innocuous it is. "I sprayed the plants with an extract of Chrysanthemums to kill the bugs" vs "I sprayed the plants with the insecticide Pyrethrin." One would draw protest, the other would not, because in large numbers, people are generally dumb as rocks and will believe email chain mail.
Thats not the purpose of our new law we want into affect.  We want to know which products are modified and which one is not.  It is up to the people then to decide what to buy for whatever reason they choose.  But the products should be labled so we can make informed decisions.
While I generally feel that extra labeling for GMO foods is a good thing, I find it revealing that some of the biggest food processing corporations are trying to block this.
Absolutely.  I wouldn't mind buying non-organic food if I knew it was treated with a biologically inert (to humans) synthetic organic pesticide, as opposed to organophosphates or other poisons.
Breeders that only use 'traditional breeding' also file tons of patents, and try to protect their IP - this is mainly to *prevent* the big guys in the field (Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta) from marginalizing small breeders.
IP protection is quite important for smaller seed companies, since they can protect their methods and the traits they identify, without Monsanto coming along and selling the same stuff next year for cheaper, to force smaller players out of the market.

I can understand that IP purely on genes is still a grey area, but as someone who works indirectly for (small) seed companies, I can clearly see how it is good for those family-owned companies to hold that IP, so that they can maintain their position in the market. Without patents, a big, global player could much easier come and push smaller companies outside of the markets. Don't forget that for Monsanto, *more* regulation is better: they can afford a 80-million release process, but a smaller biotech-firm does not. This means that a small company with a good idea can not afford to even try and sell their seeds because of the heavy regulation, and will just try to sell their patent to Monsanto or Bayer. There are 2 sides of the coin...

GMOs are furthermore not more or less dangerous than 'introgressed' traits, I work with tomato, and there is are some nasty chemicals in wild tomato plants that could easily be bred into normal tomatoes, creating a product that is by most definitions unhealthy, yet completely GMO-free.
Regarding the proprietary nature of GMO-plants: all hybrids species are effectively the same, only that you don't need a lawsuit, but by nature the next generation will just be crap and useless.

It is furthermore not really true that only GMO plants promote the use of a single genotype, normal hybrids do exactly the same, and it takes the same amount of biotech to produce those seeds up to a good level (don't underestimate the biotech that goes into 'traditional' breeding!), making it expensive to do with 3000 local maize varieties.

Besides, yes all of the *current*  genotypes will eventually be susceptible to whatever pest comes along, but that doesn't prevent improvements. These seed companies monitor very well where insect and pathogen species occur, and if they should (prophylactically) breed resistance against it. It's not the 1800s anymore, and insects and pathogens take time to establish themselves, and don't take over a whole continent in a summer.
As a post-doc in plant science, I'm completely against this labeling - it doesn't bring anything, and it gives a bad name to biotech... (disclosure: I work for breeders, but none of them really sell GMOs )
Legitimate question: If selective breeding is the same as GMOs, is it possible to "selectively breed," the trait of glow-in-the-dark plants, for example? 

My point is that even within the confines of selective breeding, you are restricted to cross-breeding with other plants. Genetic manipulation takes this to a whole new scale, no?
I found the Washington State Academy of Sciences report to be brief and useful on this subject (and specifically on what's in scope for the Washington State initiative) with a ton of references.

http://www.washacad.org/initiatives/index.html - [link directly to PDF](http://www.washacad.org/initiatives/WSAS_i522_WHITEPAPER_100913.pdf)
To me it seems akin to spreading lies about chocolate being poisonous because you don't like Nestle's business practices.
To be fair the main concerns are caused by the idea of transgenically modified food. The concept of this is transferring genetic material from one organism to another which could not happen naturally (i.e. a sequence from a fish being inserted into a corn genome). This is probably what most people associate genetic modification with and has occasionally caused some minor problems in the produce, depending on how the gene is expressed (e.g. producing a harmful bi-product).

Cisgenic engineering is transferring the genetic material within the species. Essentially it is, as you said, selectively breeding and given enough time with some plants this could be bred naturally. In this way cisgenic engineering is just an accelerated breeding process. It also will be easier to predict as the associated sequences are generally conserved within the species. This is by far the more common method.

Regardless, a product that has been suitably tested should not be a problem. If anything they should list where it was grown so that genetically modified food can be judged by the companies that produce them instead.
My favorite GMO crop is the banana. Checkmate hippies.
I posted something like this on moveon.org about two years ago, and was accused of being an intern/shill/plant (pun intended) for Monsanto. 
Not to mention that passing something like this would be similar to the passing of California's Proposition 65 that requires a label warning that a food, etc. contains components that may cause cancer. Since damned near everything contains something that *may* cause cancer, almost every food has that label, and pretty much every restaurant, store, etc. has a label at the door that says the same thing. People just ignore them since they're not helpful in the least. The GMO labeling law will be more or less the same as the Prop 65 warning, I'd bet money on it.
There are some objections to GMO crops re: sustainability, with a lot of parallels to antibiotic use.

I recall a story about India and the widespread use of special GM cotton that was supposed to boll weevil resistant. It worked for a while, until the only boll weevils left weren't affected, effectively creating an evolutionary pressure for stronger boll weevils. Superbugs in a more literal sense than the medical one.

I think there is a reasonable fear that the same thing could happen with blight resistant GM crops.

That said, I don't really have a problem with GM crops. I think it ought to be labelled, because I think it would help people get over their irrational fear, rather than leaving the general public susceptible to scare tactics about people trying to sneak GMOs into their food.
Neat, now can they please label all the GMO foods so we can eat them? Don't want to be eating that natural crap. 
> Genetically modifying a crop doesn't carry any more risk to health than selectively breeding.

While I generally agree with what you're saying, this is an overly-broad statement. It also implies that genetic modification only consists of selecting genetic traits already present in some portion of the crop. But this is not true; and it is likely to become less and less true as our mastery of genetic modification grows.

The problem with the debate around genetically-modified crops is that it's actually a plethora of issues, but it gets treated as if it were a single issue because people are generally ignorant and/or confused about the issues involved.

First, you've got artificial selection of existing traits in the crop. This is (or at least should be) largely non-controversial from a health standpoint.

Second, however, you've got the issue of a loss of genetic variation in a crop. As you mention, this genetic homogeny makes crops more susceptible to mass failure. In addition, there are currently only limited or nonexistent efforts to maintain a record of the full breadth of a crop's current genome, leading to the risk that genetic information that could be very useful in the future may be getting lost to the monopolistic practices of today.

Third, speaking of monopolies, you have the deep economic issues of terminator genes. And these get bundled up with the related issues of IP law and the viability of family farms (both of which are complicated issues in their own right).

Fourth, you have the issue of essentially new foodstuffs being created from spliced genetic material that are not being sufficiently tested for safety. (An easy target here are the crops modified to secrete pesticides.)

And right now we're just dealing with crops. As genetic-modification begins spreading to other aspects of our lives (our pets; ourselves) things are only going to get more complicated. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to NOT treat this as some monolithic issue. It is a multitude of issues and each of them needs to be dealt with separately and independently.
>Genetically modifying a crop doesn't carry any more risk to health than selectively breeding.

That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it.  As a consumer I'm entitled to make my own judgements.  Those who suggest that science has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that genetically modified foods **cannot** be harmful are lying or ignorant.  Genetically modified foods have not been in existence long enough to have any conclusive studies about possible long term implications.  No doubt you disagree - again your opinion.  If you don't see the problem with the government telling people what information they are entitled to, then you are the problem.  People should always have all available information to make their own decisions, regardless of what you think is or isn't necessary.  The same arguments are made by the beef industry to block testing on meat for mad cow disease, because they say it isn't necessary.  It's not up to them, its up to us.
I've been thinking for awhile now of what people in the future are going to look back on and think those guys are idiots in the same way we look back at the witch burnings that held back scientific and medical research for years. 

I think I figured out what it will be, people shunning genetically modified crops, stem cell research, cloning, etc / the general way a lot of people look at these things as "playing god", or that they are unsafe when it is not true  is holding back advancements in a lot of things that can save / extend lives and help feed hungry people in third world countries.

These are the stupid things we are doing this day and age that are the equivalence of witch burnings back in the day, holding up scientific progress on stupid religious beliefs or untrue "facts".
Fucking THANK YOU.  People are FAR too misinformed about this.

+/u/bitcointip 1 beer verify
Ok but there's no drawback to knowing if I product contains GMO's. Why not be informed?
>The risk in growing GMO food is held by the grower, not the consumer.

I agree with most of what you're saying, but this is patently untrue. Considering that 10% of every calorie we eat is from soybeans, imagine the impact of a blight like the Irish Potato famine on soybeans? It would be a financial disaster.

Why caffeine?
Don't Pepsi and Coke already do that?  
I actually don't really get the fuss with GMO foods. To me, it just seems like a way of scientifically manipulating our food for the better. There's a huge potential in this. Why be scared of it?
>I'm ok with this, honestly. The entire idea of labeling food with GMO's is retarded.

I'm on the fence.  If this is enacted, non-GMO foods will be more expensive, which will basically boil down to a "stupid tax" on people who buy non-GMO foods because they think there is a difference. It will disproportionately affect the poor and uneducated because these people will be the most likely to fear the GMO label.  And unlike lottery ticket revenue (the other "stupid tax"), the proceeds from the non-GMO products won't go to schools. 
Can someone tell me what the difference in the end product is with GMO vs plants that were bred over 1000's of generations to be a certain way?  Isn't having more control over the outcome better to avoid undesirable side mutations?
I think regardless of any harms, real or imagined consumers should be able to have the knowledge of GMO ingredients in the products they make. Just like any other dietary concern. I.e contains animal products or peanuts.
I demand labeling that tells me the sexual orientation of the farmer who grew my food. I have a right to be informed as a consumer! 
I know the hivemind will downvote me to oblivion for this, but I have to address a couple of things here:

>There's nothing biologically wrong with eating GMO crops. Many, many studies have confirmed this.

To be clear, all of the studies that have been conducted vis a vis human consumption and possible effects of GMO have been short term, none have been done to address long term potential chronic incidences of allergies or diseases in humans, and quite frankly may never be conducted.  

In order to conduct a proper long range human study, firstly it would need to be multi-year, preferably multi-decade, and follow the same set of human subjects who consume GMO over that multi-year or multi-decade period, since some diseases and disorders, such as cancers or neurological diseases can take years to grow or develop before they are diagnosed.  In addition, and most importantly, it would also need to contain a control group of human subjects who consume **no** GMO over the same multi-year or multi-decade period, so that the rates of incidences of diseases or disorders can be compared between groups to see if there is any statistically significant difference between the group that consumed GMO foods and the one that didn't.  

But consider what that would entail.  The control group would need to ensure for a period of however many years that they do not consume any GMO, lest they taint the findings of the study.  Yet that is near impossible to do.  The only way currently to guarantee one is not consuming any GMO is to exclusively purchase and consume certified organic food products.  That means that for however many years, the members of the control group cannot eat out at restaurants, since the vast majority of restaurants do not label what ingredients are GMO (Chipotle being a recent exception).  They cannot eat at parties or gatherings unless they have inquired the exact provenance of the food being provided.  And finally, they cannot cheat on their eating choices.  Basic human tendencies say that over time, most of the members of such a control group will **not** go to such lengths, even if they say they did.  And of course that doesn't begin to address the issue of whether members of the control group consumed GMO for years prior to becoming a member of the study, and if they even know if they did or not.

In other words, finding and maintaining a valid non-GMO consuming control group over a period of years for a study is next to impossible, and no such studies have been done thus far.  Therefore, we can say that we simply do not know what the long range effects on human GMO consumption are, good, bad, or indifferent.

Now, the usual response to this is that if there were long range effects of GMO consumption, surely we would be seeing them in humans by now.  And yes, that is correct.  But the problem is, we may well be seeing them now, we just don't know what they're being caused by.  If someone gets cancer, in many cases we don't know for sure what caused it.  If someone gets Parkinson's, we don't know for sure what caused it.  If someone develops a food allergy, we don't know for sure what caused it.  For all we know, these are precisely the effects that are showing up from long range GMO consumption, but cannot be properly attributed vis a vis causation.  Note that I'm not saying any of those things are being caused by long range GMO consumption, just addressing a commonly raised objection.

>not asking for a label that will do nothing but cause fear and confusion.

This type of statement itself is misleading and fear mongering.  Here is what the labeling looks like for a food product sold in a country which requires mandatory GMO labeling:

http://imgur.com/kZgC3PB

Did you catch it?  Most people probably wouldn't if they weren't going line by line through that list of ingredients.  I know I didn't catch it myself on first glance, I had to scrutinize it carefully to find the GMO labeling.  Not too scary or confusing.

Note that the only way to see the GMO labeling is to turn the product over, pore over the list of ingredients, and find it contained therein.  In other words, this isn't about mandating skull and crossbones on the front of a product, or even anything saying GMO on the front of a product, but simply requiring, just like with requirements of nutritional values and ingredients listings that currently exist, somewhere in the list on the back to state which ingredients if any contain GMO.  

So the only consumers that will be affected by this are those who actively wish to avoid GMO, and the burden is placed entirely upon them to carefully read through the label on the back of a food product to find out if it contains GMO or not.  To someone who doesn't care, or doesn't know, there would be no functional difference in their purchasing, given that most consumers don't even look at the ingredients list on the stuff they buy anyway.  Hell, the average consumer sees a product which screams "Heart healthy" or "Fat free" on the front of the packaging, and that's good enough for them to think it's a good choice.

Long story short, mandatory labeling is not some bogeyman that will scare and confuse consumers, all it will do is provide greater information for those who already seek it out.
I never understand this argument - it can be honestly boiled down to: *consumers are so stupid that we need to protect them from themselves...by providing them less information*. Whoa! If there is nothing wrong with it, then there should be no concerns about putting it on the package. Most people won't change their habits anyway.
I think food should be labeled so consumers can make an informed purchasing decision. Even if that decision is made from ignorance, that's no reason to hide the information from consumers.


Edit: dear everyone, you have made a good point about the importance of relevancy. You can stop making it now.
I wonder if instead of spending all this money to stop the labeling, which looks as if there is something to hide, they spent it on consumer education about GMO foods.  Start and all out marketing blitz on why GMO foods are good for us and the world, invest in more studies that can be published to back their claims, etc.    
Great points. Honestly it'd be easier and less of a hassle to label all foods that AREN'T GMO's. Which is actually already done as common practice. That's what you get when you have organic foods for the most part. GMO's are a very promising facet of development and future study. Much like embryonic stem cell research, or somatic stem cell research. But with far less ethical implication. Did you know they are able to use Bananas to administer vaccines to children in Africa. The scientific leaps being made are INCREDIBLE. 
I think the media and public are misinformed between the definition of a GMO and transgenic crops, every food you have ever eaten and most pets are gmo's 
Seriously.  People think Nestlé is evil, but if we got rid of GMOs I'm fairly sure a large part of the world would starve.
I've noticed a gradual change in Reddit's opinion on this subject and the fact that your comment is the top post helps confirm that. It's good to see.
Yeah, really the news story should be "Washington state wants to require labels for foods made with genetically modified organisms."
>The entire idea of labeling food with GMO's is retarded. It does nothing to actually inform the consumer. 

Well, that's complete nonsense. Adding information is, *by definition*, informing. If you receive information that a product contains GMO, you have been informed.  Why are you in favor of keeping people in the dark?
Serving sizes are, for the most part, dictated by the [FDA's food labeling guidelines](http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006828.htm), which are a fun read I can assure you. The general idea is to allow the consumer to compare nutrition information across packages in a way that is as portion-neutral as possible.

So for soup, the RACC (reference amount customarily consumed - a wordy way of saying serving size) is 245g of prepared soup. If the container is between 100g and 150% of RACC (367g), it's supposed to be labeled as 1 serving. If it's between 150% and 200% of RACC (367-490g), it can be labeled as 1 or 2 servings at the manufacturer's discretion (which is a little weird), and over that it's subject to the FDA's rounding guidelines.

It's like this for pretty much every food. What I'd like to see changed is, for multi-serving foods that can conceivably be eaten by one person in one sitting, per-serving numbers should be presented alongside package totals.
This. The funny portion sizes ruin the whole point of the labels: to help people understand what they are eating. Who the hell eats 1/5 of a candy bar?
Except not explicitly—*that* would be bribery. In theory it's just people trying to convince the senators and congresspeople of their positions. But in reality those senators and congresspeople very coincidentally receive big campaign contributions or lucrative job offers from the companies behind the lobbyists.

The US actually has one of the lowest incidences of “bribery” in the whole world. Because that system doesn't count.
The problem is people are stupid and will see GMO and go "OMG that's terrible, I'm not buying it!".

It's like how people buy something labeled "organic" and think they are eating better.  It's bullshit and we shouldn't need to pander to people's irrational views.
The gmo scare is the lefts climate change denial
My favourite brand of chips specifically markets as "non-GMO", which kills me inside but they're too delicious to stop buying.
MRI is still called NMR in science (e.g. chemistry) because *we know what a fucking nucleus is*.
These aren't two sides of the same issue, these are two completely separate issues.  Regulation to control monopolies doesn't need to hurt the market for perfectly good GMO plants.
that issue is pretty much independent of GMO's and GMO labeling requirement would have no effect on it.
You mean like what they already do, without widespread GMO usage?
Yes, and they are a little nervous that the FoxNews watching part of the US will think that GMOs are somehow scary and will kill them, impacting their sales even though there is no evidence backing up this claim.
I'm sort of indifferent to the matter but lets be honest their support has nothing to do with science.  It has to do with money and their own self interest.
No, they believe in profits. They fear that the new labels will hurt their bottom line. 
Yes because those companies sure do care about the consumer and the environment!
Fellow Washingtonian here as well and agree.  If anything, if someone wants to advertise that their products are GMO free then they could similar to the USDA organic certification. I dot think we should force companies to label products as non-organic so this doesn't sit right with me. 
> GMOs have very positive uses and we need to treat them with a nuanced attitude

I'm on the fence about this bill, and this is exactly why. What I *want* is for GMO ingredients in the ingredients list to be labeled with an indication of what specific transgenes they contain. I-522 provides almost no useful info to the consumer, but  could be the framework for something useful. Maybe if it fails by a small margin it'll come back in better form. ( <---- crazy optimism )


Central Illinois?  I know a lot of farmers that were replanting in June.  I felt sorry for them, but I guess they didn't come out too bad in the end.  
This is exactly what I'm always talking about.  To remove the ability to lobby would create a pretty tyrannical system where the government can regulate industries that never get their voice heard or their interests represented.  What we want is transparency and limitations on what the government can actually do, so that rent seeking is less of a problem.
What were your yields compared to regular crops? Also could you point me to more information about other seed companies (traditional breeding?) that make you sign a contract?
> Pretty sure when giant multinational Agro-businesses with billions of dollars in profit claim that a new labeling system will "bankrupt" Washington farmers, they're full of shit.

This.  

These companies are not spending millions of dollars on anti labelling campaigns because they are trying to protect farmers/consumers.  
We should devise a system where experts from the industry are sent around to brief members of Congress on the effects of legislation, and to recommend further legislation in the public interest. Maybe the companies involved will even agree to pay for these experts. Since they'll be "briefing", perhaps we can call them "briefists."
>  How do you legitimately provide the 200+ lawmakers the information that they need to make an appropriate decision?

I'm pretty sure it is printed on the back of some pretty large donation checks. :-)
Do you have any links to these independent studies or a summary of their results and what aspects of GMOs they are critical of?
Or maybe it is just the free market at work? Retailers are already pushing the labeling requirement. They tried to fight labeling for growth hormones in milk and in the end, retailers are the ones who forced the issue because their customers wanted it.

SO what? I don't give a fuck about GMOs but if people want to avoid them (however they are defined), they should be able to.

Every argument against this is just fucking retarded. Is it that hard? People want to avoid GMOs, they should be able to. You think it is dumb? Well so what? The companies should educate them then.

You just don't get to decide that someone cannot avoid something they want to avoid.
Seeing as we already subsidize tobacco farmers in this country, which produce a product that in and of itself isn't harmful (a tobacco leaf) but is most widely used in a product that does cause harm (smoking tobacco), I don't see why subsidizing non-GMO companies is a bad thing.

We already subsidize GMO's. Why not subsidize the non-GMO's? 
Because they're biotech companies. And they deal with, you know, biotech. 
they should rather support education so people would be able to separate fact from fiction. Like not believing GMO is dangerous and knowing what basic breeding is 
In Europe it's pretty common to encounter products on shelves with a clear NO-GMO ingredients label.
Currently all, corn for instance, is shipped to a grainery where it is all mixed together from different source in a big bin. When a producer buys these ingredients, no one can tell them what farm it came from, and many times what strain it is. The infrastructure isn't designed to keep different kinds of foods separate, especially not separate enough to comply with any regulations. Could you imagine a grain bin needing vacuumed and cleaned before a new corn type could be stored there to avoid trace contamination from the previous bin's contents?

GMO labeling will force a produce to product history chain for ingredients. This will cost some infrastructure upgrade. It will be negligible to the consumer cost. The customer will benefit greatly from this added information. Food industry companies are just afraid people will know where they get their ingredients from. They don't care so much about the GMO issue.
Doing it nationally starts at the state level.
> "the state of CA has determined this product contains materials known to the state of CA to cause cancer."

I'm in Ontario, and just bought a cheap plastic license plate cover that had that sticker. I was pretty bewildered. Upon serious consideration, I decided not to eat the licence plate cover.
Where does the useless labeling stop then? 

This food was harvested by a white American. 

This company uses mechanized farming 

This ear of corn was harvested using a harvester 4500 by the ford company. 

The only reason for a label in this case is some hazard or health concern. This does not exist here, so labeling the food as gmo makes as much sense as labeling that it was picked by an immigrant. 
Because typically labeling "contains X" means that ingredient is somehow dangerous or caution is necessary in some way.

It shouldn't be the food company's job to tell you how the product is safe. That's up to the FDA or USDA.

Your argument probably makes sense to you, but it's full of biases.
Well, kinda. The issue of the anti-label group (Of which I am one) is that there is no proof that a given GMO causes any harm. Thus why FORCE companies to label them. If a company want's to claim it's free of GMO's, good for them.

It would be like forcing companies to label that their food was exposed to radio waves because some crazy faction insists that cell phone towers cause cancer.

Actually, now that I think of it, it's more like forcing your school to teach intelligent design because evolution insults someones religious beliefs. 

But I don't live in California, so, my vote doesn't count.
Some science? Care to cite. 
Because it lends credibility to the idea that there is an important difference between GMOs and non-GMOs.

Say I think corn from Iowa is packaged by a bunch of filthy rednecks. For that reason, I'm pretty sure it's unsafe and I want all corn to either be labeled "this corn is from Iowa" or "this corn is NOT from Iowa." Why can't I have that done? I think if soup was packaged in daytime it can give you cancer. Why can't I have that?

I want every single detail about my food, written in a novel. I want a book that comes with every single piece of food at the supermarket. Why can't I have that? Price? If price is a reason, that's fine--we should come up with a way to decide what is and what is not important to include on food.
Except that

1.)  It costs (in my opinion wastes) money

2.)  It can cause unnecessary fear in poorer and less educated people

3.)  It's step one on a slippery slope.  As I mentioned higher up, people could argue for further labeling that serves no purpose.  Maybe I want my food labeled as 'Human Harvested' instead of Machine Harvested.  Maybe I want my crops picked by a good person.  Maybe I genuinely believe in Astrology so I want my Corn 'Picked by an Aquarius' and not a Capricorn.  There's just as much scientific support for Astrology as there is for negative impacts of GMOs on human health.

*edit:  there vs their
Why?  Before GMOs did need to know if the wheat you ate in your bread was produced by traditional chemical genetic mutation before you could eat it?  Or which strains it was produced from?  None of this would mean anything to you as you probably don't have a biology degree, and it would just cost money, making your food cost more.

Edit:  and the harm of labeling is that it supports unjustified fears that GMOs are dangerous.  They are not cigarettes and do not need labels. 
Well, that's not true. If the GMO label scares away customers because they mistakenly believe it is bad for them, that does harm the company. Also, if they have to reconfigure their production/distribution chain in order to meet GMO labeling laws that exist in some states but not others, that will cost money and therefore harm the company.

For the record, I'm not completely convinced GMOs are just as dangerous/healthy as crops that are selectively bred. I have to vote on this issue (its on the ballot on WA) and I'm still undecided, so I'm playing devil's advocate here.
There is harm in the form of increased cost. Also requiring labeling makes people think it is harmful.
All this really is is a PR battle. If you want to get technical we've been genetically modifying crops for thousands of years with selective breeding. 
Lots of people would NOT eat GMO stuff, despite the fact something being GMO is mostly irrelevant 
Groucho for ya:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHash5takWU
I live in northern europe - and all store bought foods are labeled. Anything ranging from energy-value, ingredients and content. If any part of the product has been GMO'ed, it'll be on there aswell. Then ofcourse, why shouldn't America be able to have it? As good an idea as the bar-code scanner / cellphone seems, it will inhibit some peoples access to the knowledge. 
[deleted]
Reddit admins seem to not care about this blatant astroturfing on all the Monsanto related postings either.  I wonder if money changed hands.
You'd have to lab test every time you have a crop yield to make sure it's non-GMO product.  That shit gets expensive right quick.
You call yourself a student, yet every single point you raise in your post has been proven wrong and debunked many many many times here on Reddit. Suing farmers? India suicides?  Really?

Please, you are not a student of environmental politics, you are very clearly an activist posting propaganda to fill your quota.
If only there were such a body.
We don't even need to limit it to things proven dangerous - and with the gutting of the FDA's budget over the last few decades, no such body really exists.  Just make it a requirement that anything which alters the food in any way (pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, etc) has to be listed, without judgement.  Consumers can decide for themselves.
*For every fruit still in this basket 5 perfectly healthy specimens have been thrown away just because they had a small blemish.*
Exactly this. 

Organic food uses huge amounts of less effective pesticides
I think the idea is to use the California approach.  If you put up signs everywhere saying "Danger!  Danger!  BAD CHEMICALS!  Scary BAD chemicals!"  Then everyone just walks past the signs without blinking, because there's nothing anyone CAN do about them.  If you want to get on an airplane, there are BAD CHEMICAL signs.  If you want to put gas in the car for a road trip instead, there are BAD CHEMICALS signs.

And in this case, if you want to eat, everything will have BAD CHEMICALS signs, so everyone will ignore them.
That's one of the arguments the no on 522 folks are making;  that consumers are too naive and easily spooked to make intelligent decisions.  Bad for business,  less keep them blissfully unaware.  EVERYTHING is already being risk-assessed for us- usually by corporations.  

At some point the people need to push back against the anti-oversite crusade. This is already a heavily compromised bill,  but a step in the right direction of consumer education. 
>non-organic food

&#3232;_&#3232; 
The only problem is that organic foods are sprayed with pesticides, the difference is that the pesticides on organic food aren't synthetic, and usually more dangerous to humans (half of the allowed organic pesticides are carcinogenic)
  
(Don't get me wrong, I'm all for labeling of any type of controversial food items including what pesticides it has, if it's modified, of if a gay man touched it (don't get me wrong, I'm not not homophobic, I just like ridiculous examples(don't get me wrong, I don't think gay rights are ridiculous)). I just love shitting on peoples beliefs)
Do people not wash things they eat? What % of pesticides used are actually inside the fruit or vegetable you're eating? Does anyone even care to find out?
Genetically modified food is more likely to have **not** been treated. Part of the genetic modification often is to make the plants more resistant to parasites and don't require to as much treatment with pesticides as a result.  
I agree with your points, have to play devil's advocate or people will dismiss you as a "corporate shill" faster than usual. Your insight is good and seems to be the growing general consensus on GMO foods, people still seem to be hanging on to the mad scientist idea of genetic manipulation though. Genetic manipulation has to be up there with computer science and physics in fields mostly heavily misrepresented in popular culture.
[deleted]
well bioluminescence evolved so, given enough time you could probably make glow in the dark plants (I am talking a really fucking long time) 
That's true, if you were breeding you would need to find a plant with a bio-luminescent mutation or have it be the result of a mutation traditionally, or inject the gene that controls for it into your sequence. So there are traits you can get through genetic modification that you wouldn't get through breeding. The risk is still the same though, you have traits that you know you selected for and everything else is a grab-bag of unknown properties.

About the specific example you gave of injecting genes for bio-luminescence, in my high school biology class we took some bacteria on a petri dish and added a solution that was just water, ions, and the gene that controlled for bio-luminescence in bacteria. Bacteria will absorb stray genetic code into them, and because they dont have a nucleus protecting a master DNA strand any genes they absorb can be exhibited. The bacteria culture grew for a few days and then didn't glow because they died =(

But if they didn't die they totally would have been glowing just from squirting isolated fragments of DNA at them. Pretty cool stuff 
It is to dogs!  Do you want to eat something that has poisons for Man's Best Friend encoded in it's very genes? /s
Some genetic engineering is not transgenetic, and just adds or removes a copy of a gene already in the plant. ( I know of tomato and apples ) 

edit: it is kind of disingenuous to use the fish in corn example, since to day, no commercial plant has been made with animal genes.
I've heard that all sweet bananas are (nearly) identical genetically. Apparently they used another variation earlier, which was pretty much wiped out in a series of banana infection of some sort. 

[More on Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana)

>The cultivars Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, Gros Michel (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to Panama disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum which attacks the roots of the banana plant.[58] Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama Disease but in 2013 there were fears that the Black Sigatoka fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.[5]


Please, someone correct me if I am wrong here:

**Bananas are not a genetically modified food**, nor are bananas today the food being identified by 522 labeling. Selective or mutation breeding are different than [genetically modified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food) food creation. 

It is my understanding that the only way you would be able to try a GMO banana right now is to participate in the various banana GMO trials such as in [Kenya](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/785763.shtml#.UnFKinDktiM) and [Uganda](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101001/full/news.2010.509.html) trials.

Edit: I am concerned that so far noone here has been making the distinction between GMO and selective breeding. Examples of GMO are Herbicide resistant corn and insecticide-producing corn. In the case of [insecticide-producing corn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_maize#Insecticide-producing_corn), protein from **bacteria** was added to the genetic makeup of the corn that kills certain insects when they eat the corn. The environmental repercussions of that are vastly more complicated than simply breeding two species of bananas. 

Bananas for perfectly in a human hand, thus proving GMO crops are God. Checkmate atheists!
I prefer corn
I love those giant Honeycrisp apples. 
In the long term, you're probably absolutely right. People will learn that the term GMO isn't anything that should particularly concern them and the labels will go ignored. In the short-term though, there will probably be large chunks of a panicky, uneducated population having the typical knee-jerk reaction, and sales for these companies will likely suffer temporarily. The only way past that is to educate the public. The state government may shoulder a portion of that, or they may not. Either way, it will likely be up to these companies to push out massive education and awareness campaigns which will cost massive advertising dollars.

So basically you've got legislation that's going to cost the state money to implement and enforce, and cost private companies money in lost sales and education campaigns, all for a label that will ultimately go almost universally ignored.
That's why I avoid "no hormones used" meat.  I want roid meat to make some sweet gains. 
I think it would be harder to find a food that DOESN'T have GMO products in it.  I mean, we've been selectively breeding for decades/centuries.  

FFS even corn cant breed in the wild anymore.  Turkeys cant breed anymore, either.  
Wow thank you. I'll be eating lunch on you today!
I assume to better regulate intake.
Caffeine is one of the most widely used addictive stimulants on the planet and people can become addicted on as little as 200mg a day. 
I thought they did?  It isn't in the list of ingredients or the nutritional table, but it's on the cans for Pepsi I am 75% sure.

EDIT: Just checked a can of Mountain Dew (a Pepsi product I think?) and it lists the caffeine amount right under the list of ingredients.
Because ignorance.
Nobody sane thinks it's harmful to *eat* it.

Buying it, or blindly supporting companies that genetically modify food without any thoughts on consequences, however, is something entirely different.
BUT IT'S NOT NATURAL!!!!

And as we all know, everything natural > everything not natural.
If GMO strains aren't each individually tested then there is serious potential for danger to not only people but the environment. The problem is that some changes expressed with GM may be difficult to notice. It is hard to say when testing is enough. 20 years? 50 years? Most strains of food we eat have been around for thousands of years or are based on strains that have. Even if you genetically modify one change in a strain of seeds, thousands of expressions of that change may occur. You have created an entirely new organism and have to start from scratch with testing. Did the intended expression occur? Will it still be safe? Will it still be healthy? Will it be dangerous to insects, bacteria, and microorganisms needed for crop growth? Will it be dangerous to birds, deer, and other animals? When and what is enough testing? Can we trust the FDA to enforce reasonable testing regulations? As you can see there is plenty room for concern, as long as you stay realistic.
Because, scary words scare people.  Much like "nuclear" and "cloning"


You can manipulate things for the better or for the worse.  The full impact is not always well understood and known for a long time.  There are a lot of scaremongers who play on this uncertainty but are not always very objective due to other interest.  Hence you get a big fuss.

[deleted]
The difference is like.. Bananas are selectively bred to be enormous sweet yellow things with no seeds instead of tiny bitter tree-turds full of seeds.

Then with GMO foods you have.. wheat. Wheat is a type of grass, there are herbicides that can kill grass but not other plants. So they took the gene from some plants that are *not* killed by grass herbicide and stuck them into wheat.

Now you can plant a field of wheat, spray it with grass killer and nothing else will grow except the wheat.

There are other examples where a certain bug doesn't eat some type of plant, because the plant makes a sort of pesticide. Stick that pesticide gene into something that traditionally is hugely vulnerable to insects and now you have a crop that won't get eaten by bugs.

GMO doesn't mean they're making plants that have 3 eyes and cause cancer.
GMO allows you to give an organism traits that would otherwise be unobtainable by conventional breeding.

For example, no matter how many times you try to breed corn, you'll never get it to spontaneously develop the bioluminescence gene.
You realize people don't avoid peanuts out of moral qualms right?

There's no law preventing food makers from labeling their food as GMO-free, if it is.  Why do we need a law?

The purpose of the law is not to educate, it's to scare.  

It's like a law requiring vaccines to say if they contain "Dihydrogen Monoxide."  It's not inherently a harmful substance (though it's killed millions of people), but plenty of dullards would be scared into thinking it is, due to public misinformation.
>I think regardless of any harms, real or imagined consumers should be able to have the knowledge of GMO ingredients in the products they make.

But what do we consider GMO. Did you know that [carrots](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/) aren't naturally orange? That this is a mutation that we purposely breed because it is sweeter?

Technically this is a genetically modified Organism, do we label all carrots GMO? Are you going to stop eating them now that you know they don't grow like that naturally? 

We have been ['Genetically Modifying' food for over 8000 years](http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2012/11/18/tomorrows-table-what-does-gmo-really-mean/). 

>Just like any other dietary concern. I.e contains animal products or peanuts.

GMO is a way of producing food. Not a type of food. 
Should we force companies to label how their food was harvested, should pre-made food be forced to label their food letting you know it was steamed not baked in order to pre-cook it?
It's not a concern though, is the whole point.
Every food you consume has been genetically modified. Do we need to start labeling food with the word food?
I'm glad you are willing to pay the higher food prices that will result from the extra costs of compliance, but I'm not.
Nobody cares about GMO ingredients. If there were more than an insignificant number of people who did care, then food producers would serve that market by labeling their food as GMO free.

It's similar to how the organic food industry works. It wouldn't make any sense to label everything as non-organic. 


Frankly, I'd push more for registration of added simple sugars. That's where the demons lie. 
The gmo labeling in the law asks for a giant label similar to cancer warnings. The bill is poorly written as it allows several exceptions. It does little to educate the consumers 
If the labeling is like that, then I have absolutely no problem with it. People who don't want to eat GMOs will have to look at the ingredients and most people wont give a shit.
>Long story short, mandatory labeling is not some bogeyman that will scare and confuse consumers, all it will do is provide greater information for those who already seek it out.

No, it will provide **no usable information** to a consumer. 

The process of genetically modifying an organism can include anything from selective breeding to shooting genetic material directly into a plants nucleus, and hundreds of processes inbetween. Would you ban crops whose genes were implanted from other strains of the same species, even if those results could be replicated using simple selective breeding given enough time? What about those which cause plants to produce a protein which exists in nature? Do the means in which the genetic material is introduced into the genome matter?

Labeling something as a GMO is a wholly useless designation.
As a toxicologist, this type of post is frustrating for me to read because it is a symptom of how little the public understands how food and drug safety is tested and regulated. Not everything must be done in humans in a chronic study to demonstrate safety. Please read up on how toxicity testing is done, and how long term toxicity/carcinogenicity is accurately accounted for.
Thank you. In the month I  have found that two long held beliefs were false:  
1. junk DNA wasn't junk, it was used to create faces. 
2. Effects of DDT are found in animals two generations removed from the originally exposed  grand and great grand parents. 

The tells me that we can very easily make the mistake of overlooking long term effects of GMO (cross breed and pesticide resistance in particular) foods.  
This needs to be the top comment.
Thanks for writing such a great piece. I'd give you gold if I had the money. But here's something for your troubles:

Thank you!
Wonderful. If I had the money to spare I would give you gold.



Thank you for speaking up! For such a progressive community, Reddit is ready to suck the dicks of Monsanto, Pepsi, Keystone XL, and give overwhelming support to sciences they don't understand "because technology." The idea that GMOs are the same as selective breeding is easily proven false, yet it is a massive circlejerk in this thread and whenever GMOs are mentioned. A GMO label doesn't tell the consumer "nothing;" it tells you that you are supporting Monsanto and their corporate-oppressive bullshit. It would be like a label saying, "This chocolate was not made using West African slave labor" or "child labor." And they most certainly have *not* "proven" that GMOs are safe for human consumption - that would take decades and loads of funds that aren't there. Cigarettes were considered safe for many decades. In science, the burden of proof falls on the one making the claim. The claim that GMOs are safe is not backed up by any long-term studies.
Thank you for this.
My concern is that the measure, as written, provides just enough information to be scary but not enough information to be useful. A measure that was really about providing useful information would, at a minimum, require listing *which ingredients* were genetically modified. Just putting "Contains GMO modified ingredients" on the front provides no more info than labeling foods without GMO ingredients (which could be done without any changes in the law). The only reason to do it is to scare people.
So, let the companies and products that are GMO free label their food as such. Then, just assume anything not labeled GMO free is not GMO free.
I think the point is that labeling the food will increase its cost by some non-zero amount without providing any compensatory benefit. At this point I think everyone should assume that any food product which contains corn or corn derivatives, soy or soy derivatives, and canola oil, probably has some measurable amount of GMO in it. And that's perfectly fine.
> Whoa! If there is nothing wrong with it, then there should be no concerns about putting it on the package.

There aren't concerns with putting it on the package.  There are concerns with FORCING everyone to put it on the package.
so how far do you want to go with the labeling? hey, why not just list the entire genome of the plant? or how about the name of the guy who harvested it? or what coordinates it was grown in? the Ph levels of the soil? SURE, slap that on there. CONSUMERS NEED TO BE "INFORMED" GODDAMNIT! point is, knowing if a plant is GMO or not is as pointless as knowing any of the things i just mentioned
This is strait from the play book of the food industry trying to resist the trans fat nutrition panel addition.
>If there is nothing wrong with it, then there should be no concerns about putting it on the package.

There's nothing wrong with water, but by giving it a name with negative connotations, [Penn & Teller managed to get hundreds of people to ask to have it banned](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi3erdgVVTw).

The intent of this bill is not to educate, and it will not educate.  The intent is to scare people.
The problem is, who gets to decide what should and should not count?  There is an infinite possibility of things that could go on a label, but only so much room.  

The First Amendment jurisprudence on mandated commercial speech provides a better guide, in my opinion, that just whatever people want.  It requires that mandated speech serve a strong government interest, and that the speech be substantially related to serving that interest.  We should work on required "contains gluten" labeling before GMO labeling, at least gluten has a demonstrable harm it causes certain people.
We shouldn't label GMOs for the same reason we don't label "non-free range" eggs or "non-organic" produce. If people really want non-gmo foods, then they should buy from companies that don't use GMOs and advertise as such.
Nestle is kinda evil though. [Nestle CEO talking about the privatisation of water.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEFL8ElXHaU&feature=youtube_gdata_player)
There's a reason why NMR was renamed MRI in hospitals. Laypeople get frightened by terminology often without reasonable cause.

what if a company requried that all "organic" food MUST be labelled with "Grown In Filthy Germ ridden excrement" on all of it. The organic industry would claim that is not fair.

If a freeze dried food company lobbied that all other food must prominantly display a sticker "contains Dihydrogen monoxide" they could be aruging that so that theirs is the only food that seems "safe" so they can put a premium on their food for somthing that is no more safe.

This is not to argue that we shouldn't lable GMO I am just trying to point out that somtimes "informing" people can be doing the oposite.
>  Why are you in favor of keeping people in the dark?

What a stupid why-do-you-hate-freedom tier thing to say. Adding information doesn't magically inform people. What what if like, you could be really selective about the information you spoon feed so it's really like *misinformation*. Wild, huh? Fox News is only informing the public. What do you have against information? 

IRL, it requires effort to digest the information. So you have two similar products. One says "Gluten free!" and only costs three pennies more. Would you pay three pennies to not have to research what a gluten is? A lot of people would. 

Why not be fair and force stuff that doesn't contain GMO to stamp on the label some other harmless yet scary sounding ingredient? So this one says "Warning: Contains GMO". While this one over here says "Warning: Contains dihydrogen monoxide".
[deleted]
Because the information is meaningless and only panders to the anti-GMO propaganda.
> Adding information is, by definition, informing. 

Adding **CORRECT, MEANINGFUL** information is informing.  Saying something "contains GMO" is not informing.
So should consumers have to know the name of the guy who picked their vegetable? Why isnt that on a label? Its information too.
Because if you have a law that says they have to do it, it sends a signal that the information is important, when really it's not. 
Pretty much every standard size candy bar lists the whole bar as the serving size.
My friends bought a package of pre-made cinnamon rolls for a camping trip not too long ago. The serving size wasn't even a single roll! It was listed in grams! Who the hell would weigh out a serving of part of a roll?? Just ridiculous
Especially when you consider that organic food was originally promoted as good for the environment over good for health. Now people see organic as healthier than non-organic, even though there has not been enough time to actually measure the benefits or risks of an organic diet. Instead people are treating it as perceived hedge against potential future health risks, e.g. I don't know if organic is better, but I'm willing to pay more on the off chance that it is.
I'll see gmo,  note that is nice to know & probably buy it because it is cheaper.
That's actually a great way to put it.
What does being left leaning have to do with denying good science?
Tell that to reddit. EVERY post regarding Monsanto, whether it's related to GMO or not, will degrade within the first two or three comments about how ignorant people are towards GMO. EVERY comment regarding the way Monsanto does business will get downvoted out of sight. 

Reddit refuses to discuss the ethics of these corporations because you're afraid it might taint the reputation of GMO in general. I have no problem with GMO but I do if it's controlled by corporations who refuse to communicate what they're doing to my food. Labeling might be pointless but the fierce resistance against it just shows how hard the industry is trying to hide their shady way of doing business.
Dont forget MSNBC watching as well.  It isnt just republicans, you twit.
Their support may be influenced by money, but it's still based on science. It's like cell phone companies spending money to dispel myths and regulations regarding non-ionized radiation because it hurts their sales as a result of stupidity. 
Their motives are irrelevant in the determinations of truth in science. Unless you just want to ignore science to screw big business.
They way I see it, you're both right.
Oh wait... So business's also like not losing money?  Fuckin A this a big news day.
As they should. That's the reason they're in business, to make money. 
> believe in modern science 

>about the consumer and the environment!

Two different statements.
Ehh, sadly I see it the same as the alcohol distro law. Failed, came back worse, passed because of the concept of the bill, not the content.
I don't know about the yields but the contract is just a formality. All newly developed varieties, GM or traditionally bred are protected intellectual property and have been for almost 100 years.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Patent_Act
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act

A organic super-crunchy hippie seed grower could sue you just as easily as Monsanto if you steal their seed. It is about protecting plant breeders from theft. They spent decades developing new strains, they deserve compensation. 
That doesn't work.  You just end up getting lobbyists in even more powerful positions. See federal reserve and treasury dept.
A free market would be one where those who produce non-gmo product voluntarily label their packaging because they know consumers prefer non-gmo over gmo and this label will increase their business.

NOT having government come down and force everyone who sells gmo to label everything based on zero scientific reasoning in order to illegitimately scare consumers into purchasing non-gmo products.

The reality is people don't give a crap, they buy what is cheaper, non-gmo is more expensive and has lost the battle of voluntary labeling helping the bottom line.  So now the non-gmo fanatics want to prop up their business model by forcing non-science down our throats to help scare people irrationally into buying more expensive product that is no safer for them than the gmo variety.
>Retailers are already pushing the labeling requirement. 

Why don't they push the producers of non-GMO products to label in stead? It seems that that would be much easier, produce the saem benefit, and not require a law?
How is a government regulation the free market at work? That's the opposite of the free market. 
Nothing is stopping them for avoiding them now. They can already buy products that say "non-GMO" and avoid ones that don't give up that information. They can educate themselves as to what types of products contain GMO's or don't. The companies themselves have private property rights to choose what they want to label or don't label. Unless there is some type of consumer protection consideration that trumps those private property rights, then there is no basis for the labelling regulation. 
Why should we have to pander to people who want to avoid GMO food?

What if I want to avoid products that were made by people making minimum wage without healthcare.  Should we require companies to start labeling that on every product?

If the consumer cares that much they can research it THEMSELVES instead of making the company label every single little thing.
You know what's retarded? Pleasing people with irrational fears and feeding hordes of unethical lawyers - at a great cost to everybody else. 

Don't think it will be a problem? Let's see how CA Proposition 65 ("this product may contain carcinogens" labeling) played out:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_65_%281986%29

In other words, everything got more expensive (you need to test & label OR avoid even traces of ingredients that are commonplace). Also, abusive lawsuits are everywhere. 

And it's really hard to put the paranoia genie back into bottle, because any politician trying to tone it down will be torn apart as "OMG he is helping big business give people cancer".

>You just don't get to decide that someone cannot avoid something they want to avoid.

You also don't get to decide that everybody else must obey your fears. If the risk is imaginary, labeling must be *voluntary*. Example: kosher food is labeled as such, but there is no pressure to label ALL other food as "may contain non-kosher ingredients".
Organic vs. non-organic labeling. It would be equally stupid to force mandatory labeling of "non-organic" labeling with zero fucking science backed proof. Let the nutters buy overpriced food.
OK. Say I want to know if my food was packaged by a muslim. Explain why your logic doesn't apply to my right to know in this case. Muslim's aren't actually dangerous, and I'm racist? Educate me. I hate muslims, I should be able to avoid companies that employ them, no?
We should start labeling products that contain *chemicals* like water and *lactic acid bacteria* like yogurt! Irrational fears for everyone!
Maybe we shouldn't subsidize any of them?
>We already subsidize GMO's. Why not subsidize the non-GMO's?

... we do. 
I see where you're coming from. However, many products that humans have determined to have a negative impact on their health were not condemned because of original testing on the product before it hit the market. Rather, after the product was consumed people noticed the correlation between the product and certain illnesses over time. Without labeling there is no traceability. Hypothetically if a person goes to see their doctor because of a symptom that is directly caused by consuming a GM food, the doctor would not be able to diagnose or report this accurately because there is no way to know whether the person consumed a GMO. Currently it doesn't even occur to most people to consider this aspect of food as pertaining to their health. You might argue that's fine because there is no health concern, but I see that as circular logic: they're safe because no one gets sick, and no one gets sick because they're so safe that we don't have to put the infrastructure in place to determine whether the sickness is caused by them.
I like that costs are the main issue for most of the anti-labeling groups, yet these companies are dumping tons of money into fighting it... therefore wasting more money.  It's all relative.  I"m not saying I'm for the labeling, but the cost argument is pretty much BS.  It's one line of text.  Mo more expensive than putting "Fat free" or "light" on a label.
What extra costs?  A label does not cost any more if it has different words on it.
I think what they were saying was that people "should have the right to know whether what they are buying is from GMOs or not." 

Also, it's not that these genetically modified foods are 100% safe to eat, the GMO companies argument is really that there isn't enough proof to deem GMOs dangerous.  We'll know for sure once this generation gets older and we see whether or not they develop health problems due to GMO consumption. 

But I would think that if the GMO-using companies believe that consuming GMOs is safe, then why is it a problem for them to be labeled?
We could call it the Food and Drug...Bureau.
Probably not thrown away, just used in a product where the consumer doesn't see the unprocessed apple. I know this is true for eggs where A grade eggs are sold whole in grocery stores and B grade eggs are used for liquid egg products or used in other food items with eggs in them. 
The consumers are more to blame for this than the producers - I used to work as a produce manager in a supermarket and used to remove all the blemished fruit from display as not only will people not buy that piece of fruit, but they don't tend to buy any of the fruit near it either(!).

Organic farmer here: it totally depends on the crop being grown and what you're up against in your particular climate and locale. 

We grow a wide assortment of all of your common vegetables and we don't use any herbicides or pesticides--even organically approved sprays. The biggest thing we do is use a light fabric row cover that prevents any bugs from getting on the plant. Pretty simple. There are all sorts of organic methods that don't involve even using organically approved sprays. 
That's a bold jump.  It varies from farmer to farmer.
Everytime someone freaks out about those "This product is known to cause cancer in the state of California," I just remind them we don't live in California, so it isn't a big deal.
Those signs have actually lead to me finding out about a lot of carcinogens that I'd now avoid. That said the "Prop 65" warning by itself is confusing and you have to do research on your own to understand if there's a real risk. The Prop 65 labeling should be modernized to give you specific information instead.
> At some point the people need to push back against the anti-oversite crusade. This is already a heavily compromised bill, but a step in the right direction of consumer education.

Why not have the oversight happen higher up with people who study in the field, rather than knee-jerk labeling idea that has no context? Maybe a new organization to oversee food safety in the US. /s

Seriously, after seeing the sheer number of completely uneducated people protesting against the "Evils of GMO/Monsanto" on Facebook, I don't want them dictating our nation's food security. There's a huge difference between BT corn and the SunUp Papaya (One is a potential allergen, one has no human side effects).

Just reading through the Wikipedia "GMO foods" article is a complete waste, since they source almost nothing in the corn and soy section other than "human safe corn is used for this" (There is no human safe GMO corn)
Look, they don't like food containing carbon  GOT IT? Now leave us in peace so we can chow down on a nice bowl of silicon dioxide.

Synthetic like a cyanide salt or heavy metal? Nature is pretty scary without synthetics. 
Do you have a source on that?
This isn't really true.  Round-up ready soybeans are modified to be resistant to round-up herbicide.
That is in no way true.  A lot of the stuff Monsanto makes for example is resistant to the pesticide Round Up that they make.  It allows farmers to soak their fields in the stuff.  A lot of the genetic modification that is going on by the big companies is less about preventing bugs/disease so much as increasing the amount of their pesticide can be sprayed before the plant simply dies.
These kinds of comments are really not conducive to the discussion at hand. This is about knee-jerk reactionism, not science. If you want to talk about facts, there are better subreddits for that.
[deleted]
If GMO foods are that good, why is it such a problem for them to be labled as such?
Great point! Consumers deserve to know the truth about this, every chocolate bar should be required to write "contains poison" on the label.
> no commercial plant has been made with animal genes.

True, but many commercial plants have been made with bacterial genes, a similar inter-kingdom transfer of genes.   
I worked on bananas in Cameroon a few years ago, I'm not an expert but let me clarify things a little.

Like many fruits, cultivated bananas have lost the ability to reproduce sexually. This means that within a variety (like the Cavendish or Gros Michel you mentioned) they are all genetically identical, like twins from a single fertilised egg. 90% of people who read this have never eaten any other variety than the Cavendish, which essentially means you've been eating cloned bananas all your life. There are roughly 1100 or so different varieties, most of which taste terrible unless you cook them. There is a repository of all varieties in the faculty of bioscience engineering in Belgium. Since they don't form seeds they are stored by having a tiny germinating banana on slow growth medium in a test tube.

History lesson: In the old days (pre 1960s) every commercial plantation in the world grew Gros Michel (fat Mike), a small, very sweet banana. It is still possible to find them sometimes in specialised supermarkets, try them, they taste much better. Everyone used to eat this and only this banana. Then Panama disease reared its ugly head and spread through the world like wildfire. This is directly related to all bananas having the same genotype, they are literally all the same, the only genetic variation is between varieties, not within one variety. Within years most banana plantations had switched to the Cavendish variety (2 different subvarieties actually) and the plantations that hadn't went bankrupt. That is why we are not eating the tastiest banana, we are eating the banana that won't die from Panama disease.

However: bad news: 

1. Black Sigatoka: a more recent disease that has spread throughout the world and caused economic disasters (especially in east africa), new disease, same problem. It is not as utterly destructive as panama disease but it is still bad news.
2. Panama disease, variant 4: Started in the 90s, variant 4 is a new version of panama disease, one to which the Cavendish varieties are not resistant.

So where does that leave us?

We need to either develop new commercial varieties, or breed resistance in existing varieties. What are the criteria for a new variety?

1. It has to taste good without cooking (I'd estimate that less than 10% of existing varieties would pass this test)
2. It has to be resistant to both diseases I mentioned
3. Slow ripening: Bananas need to be transported from tropical countries to Europe/US/whatever. They are cut when they are not yet ripe and ripen during transport (and also is specifically designed gas chambers). If the variety ripens fast it is probably useless. Incidentally the first genetically modified food for commercial use was a slow ripening tomato (it was a commercial failure in the 90s)
4. The variety can't grow too tall. Tall banana 'trees' are more difficult to harvest and more prone to damage in storms.
5. It has to look and taste like what consumers think a banana looks and tastes like. Google Popoulou or Figue rose, the first is shaped more like a big potato and the second is dark purple.

AS you can see, it's not easy in the field of banana research these days, and the next years are going to be pretty exciting. 

Last note: my favourite variety is 'Yangambi 5 km', called that way because it was first described next to a roadsign in Kongo that said 'Yangambi 5 km'.
Bt is an organic, non-harmful pesticide. Organic farmers spray it on crops all the time, and it isn't even potentially harmful.

Transgenic Bt-producing crops kill far fewer insects than using spray-on Bt, as it is only in the plants rather than sprayed on a large area.
Practical concerns over environmental issues are a lot more legitimate than ridiculous knee jerk fear mongering that GMOs are poisonous or someone dangerous to consume, when there is absolutely zero evidence to support such claims. GMOs are where the segments of the left start looking like the anti science right wing. 
GMO can include breeding, as breeding modifies the genes of a plant or animal in a controlled manner. Same with crossbreeding.

However, 522 only labels GMOs that have undergone transgenic modifications, that is, genetic modification by transplanting specific genes of one organism into another. This is the type of modification that is most often implied when someone says "GMO".
>I am concerned that so far no one here has been making the distinction between GMO and selective breeding. 

Alright, I'll try to answer that as best I can. 

So in selective breeding you take two parents with traits you desire and crossbreed them to try to generate offspring with those desired traits. The issue is that because of dominant and recessive genes sometimes those traits will not show up in the offspring or will disappear in later generations. This means it can sometimes take a while to get exactly what you want, especially if you are trying to combine multiple beneficial traits. 

In GMO's you are using knowledge about which genes you want or don't want and recent scientific techniques to modify the genetic makeup of the organism. This makes it a targeted approach and you can get very specific in what's being done. (Where in selective breeding it's an entire mixing of half of the genetic code from each parent). There are several common approaches for genetically modifying an organism

* Removing an undesired gene or trait
* Overexpressing a desired gene or trait
* Adding a new gene

>from **bacteria** 

So this actually happens a lot. I'll explain why, how, and what for. It's a bit of information, but bear with me and pm if you have any questions. 

~Bio Review~

All life is made up of the same building blocks, with a little bit of variety but not much. The genetic code is stored in DNA/RNA made up of nucleic acids commonly denoted A, G, T, U, and C. Each three block segment of nucleic acids codes for something called an Amino Acid. Amino Acids in turn are the building blocks for larger structures called proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, they do everything: breaking down sugar molecules for energy, copying DNA, breaking down toxins/things that shouldn't be there, and building other macromolecules necessary for cells/organisms to grow and reproduce. 

~But why take genetic material from one organism and put it in another~

Even though all living things share the same building blocks, each has developed uniquely in terms of which genes it carries and also complex control over genetic expression. I'll use the production of insulin to explain. 

Insulin is a strictly eukaryotic (complex organisms, like mammals, yeast, etc) protein. The issue is eukaryotic cells grow very slowly, they are sensitive to environment, and require very specific nutrients to keep alive. (they have to be bathed in sugar, nitrogen source, essential amino acids, etc.) This is in contrast to common prokaryotes, a.k.a. bacteria (like E. Coli), which can grow on just sugar, and reproduce very quickly. 

What ended up happening (very simplified version) is the human gene for insulin was isolated, and converted to a form the bacteria could read. The necessary genes were then put into E. Coli and the result was that the E. Coli cells could now produce human insulin that was exactly identical to insulin made by humans. This meant more insulin could be produced faster, at less cost, and with less sensitivity to disturbances in the process. 

Fundamentally, because all living things share the same building blocks you can move any desired gene from one organism to another. This is a great advantage of the genetic tools available today, and another advantage of GMO's. The fundamental part to understand is it is the final product that matters more than which organism it was taken from.

Of course you don't want the bacteria ending up in your final product, (you wouldn't want any living cells actually, doesn't matter which classification they're from) So there's actually a large number of ways to make sure the cells used stay where they are supposed to and don't make it to the final product. 

This is getting kind of long, so I'll stop there. PM or comment if you have questions or concerns. I'm not an expert, but I've studied the methods for how GMO's are made pretty extensively and should be able to answer quite a bit of questions. 


> So basically you've got legislation that's going to cost the state money to implement and enforce, and cost private companies money in lost sales and education campaigns, all for a label that will ultimately go almost universally ignored.

My point exactly, but much better stated.
The turkey's roaming all over the country-side aren't breeding? Huh. TIL
The term GMO doesn't cover selective breeding.
Considering there are wild turkeys everywhere in North America, I would guess that isn't true.
You are now subscribed to Caffeine Facts.
There seems to be a general confusion over the difference between [hybridization and genetic modification](http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/hybrid-seeds-vs-gmos-zb0z1301zsor.aspx#axzz2jEeWhH87). Plums and apricots could get together naturally and make a delicious baby, we just have also found a way to control and exploit it. But corn and *Bacillus thuringiensis* is not something that can fuck and procreate. My concern is less about what's going to happen to me and more for the ecological impact. This has not been well studied. I'm only going to be here for a short period, but the potential devastation that could be caused by a shortsighted solution by these massive corporations should be a legitimate concern. These are not corporations with good track records in that regard. The goal of pushing for labeling is that it does have a negative impression and will either push these companies toward doing more research to prove that the impression is wrong, or just move away from it altogether.

*edit: extra words words
Same reason people are against stem cell research.
Would you hold other manipulations to the same standard?  If you say, cross two different strains of seeds together (as we've been doing for thousands and thousands of years), you're breeding an entirely new plant. Would you also have to start from scratch with testing?  Will it still be safe? Will it still be healthy? Will this new strain be dangerous to insects, bacteria, and microorganisms needed for crop growth? Will it be dangerous to other animals?

Would you hold traditional cross-breeding of plants to the same standard?  Why not?  After all, that's arguably a MUCH bigger change in an organisms genome than genetic modification that occurs in a lab.
All of those arguments apply equally to just breeding new strains of organisms.

But, regardless, the solution is not to label them in stores. That won't stop the practices of GMO. The solution is to enact better guidelines and regulations.
A ten year review of of genetically engineered crop safety research just recently showed that GMOs are safe. The review didn't find any significant negative impacts on humans, animals, or the environment.

Here's a link to a summary of the article: http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/10/massive-review-reveals-consensus-on-gmo-safety.html

Does the FDA require testing on GMOs right now?
This is the perfect justification for new legislation regulating agribusiness research practices, and very, very bad justification for food-labeling legislation.
If you can trust the FDA for pharmaceutical testing, then let me tell you it's exactly the same thing for GM foods.
> It is hard to say when testing is enough. 20 years? 50 years?

This same question can be asked about ANY food or drug released to the market, and every time it is asked, it only betrays the lack of understanding of the public on how predictive long-term toxicology and carcinogenicty models work in testing safety.

Some additional reading on the requirements from international (not just FDA) requirements, with references on how these ACCURATELY predict long term safety and carcinogenicity.

http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/safety/article/safety-guidelines.html

Food was more dangerous before GMOs. At least with genetic engineering you know what you are getting before you make it. With breeding you leave it to chance. Did you know the potato is related to the deadly nightshade? They make the same poison and can be deadly with just a minor mutation.
> If GMO strains aren't each individually tested then there is serious potential for danger to not only people but the environment.

Yes

> The problem is that some changes expressed with GM may be difficult to notice.

No.  There's no reason to think that there would somehow be some hidden danger in a GMO vs. e.g. a new hybrid.  Either can have unexpected changes that result in toxicity or allergic reaction, but we've been testing for that for decades.  Genetic technologies are not some magical 'black box'.  The modifications being performed can be evaluated for risks.  For instance, anything that might affect secondary metabolism in plants would be a greater concern, as it could produce unintended and potentially toxic metabolites.  Even in this case, however, we'd know what to look for and we have the tools to test this.

If you don't trust the FDA and/or USDA to responsibly approve these crops, why would you trust their work over the past decades testing new hybrids and breeds?
>Most strains of food we eat have been around for thousands of years or are based on strains that have.

GMOs are based on the same strains. The only thing that has changed is how the genetic differences that selective breeding works on are induced.
It's worse than that.  I had a greenpeace guy stop me in the street for a petition calling it 'frankenfood'.
>Never

I will take this to mean that we'd have to be extremely lucky for it to happen on its own and the corn still be some kind of edible, to the point that it's effectively impossible (It would take millions of years with humans constantly selecting, and it's still not guaranteed to happen)

I wasn't really thinking of it this way before and your answer helps clarify the difference in the end product.

[The scary truth about DHMO](http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html)
If you look into the process of genetic modification and compare it to selective breeding, I think you'll find that the two are vastly different. One accentuates traits already present in the DNA, while another artificially implants or modifies DNA that is new and foreign. You could never get salmon genes into a tomato through selective breeding. Tomatos have been altered over thousands of years from their ancient wild form perhaps more than any other fruit or vegetable, but there was never anything done to them that made them any less a tomato.
> Technically this is a genetically modified Organism

No, *technically* it's not.  Genetic engineering is a specific technological process that is distinctly different than selective breeding.  
Either way I think consumers should have the information. Companies can run ads supporting GMO just like they do with high fructose corn syrup. 
> most people wont give a shit.

Then why require it? For the select few who care?
> The process of genetically modifying an organism can include anything from selective breeding to shooting genetic material directly into a plants nucleus...

But it really isn't. "GMO" refers to plant varieties that are created through Genetic Gene Splicing and that is what most people want to be informed about. This isn't a debate on hybrids. 

Even if GMOs are totally 100% safe people have the right to know if what they are eating has been manipulated by gene splicing. The issue with the Washington law is that effectively it will establish GMO labeling across the entire country for nearly everything as creating a label just for products going to Washington would be costly for producers. I believe this is the heart of this particular fight. 

It took more than 10 years for "Country of Origin" labeling to finally get its act together; PTI and GTIN initiatives are already more than five years old and have almost zero market adoption. So even if passed, it will be a long while before we see actual enforcement.

selective breeding is not considered GM and is done for millenias.
These companies couldn't care less if it's meaningful info or not. They oppose providing this information because too many people still prefer non-GMO. In other words, they are against consumers exercising their right to an informed choice. This is up there with the worst kinds of fascism.
I'm sorry but did you read his comment at all? We do not have long term health effects properly measured yet. You are making a statement based on what we know now. Considering genetic engineering are vastly different depending on the food item, how could you possibly make such a claim?

It's not the same thing obviously, but the thinking was Shoe-fitting fluoroscopes were a good idea at some point in the last century. 

>The risk of radiation burns to extremities were known since Wilhelm Röntgen's 1895 experiment, but this was a short-term effect with early warning from erythema. The long-term risks from chronic exposure to radiation began to emerge with Hermann Joseph Muller's 1927 paper showing genetic effects,[4] and the incidence of bone cancer in radium dial painters of the same time period. However, there was not enough data to quantify the level of risk until atomic bomb survivors began to experience the long-term effects of radiation in the late 1940s. The first scientific evaluations of these machines in 1948 immediately sparked concern for radiation protection and electrical safety reasons, and found them ineffective at shoe fitting.[5]

So it took us 30+ years to document long term effects of radiation exposure and even then it was not enough data until survivors of atomic bomb in the late 1940s started to experience long term effects. Even after all this they kept using these shoe fitting machines considering the amount of radiation safe for customers...Imagine the kids and pregnant women around these machines which may or may not have had cracks.

Here is the wiki entry on it today:
>Years or decades may elapse between radiation exposure and a related occurrence of cancer, and no follow-up studies of customers can be performed for lack of records. Without such an epidemiological study, it is impossible to conclude whether this machine actually caused any harm to customers.[5] Three shoe salespersons have been identified with rare conditions that might be associated with their chronic occupational exposure: a severe radiation burn requiring amputation in 1950,[10] a case of dermatitis with ulceration in 1957,[11] and a case of basal cell carcinoma of the sole in 2004.[8]

Considering the significant unknows about innerworkings of humanbeings, we can not make blanket statements about what we put into our bodies...

I for one would like to see if it's GM- they do it in Europe since 2004... We'll be ok.



and now everything is full of saturated fat palm oil instead.
We have mountains of evidence that trans fats are bad for people and zero evidence that GMOs are bad for people.
For those whose don't know the terms

MRI = Magnetic Resonance Imaging

NMR = Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

It's amazing how not using the term "nuclear" makes people totally OK with sticking their heads in a machine.  Use the term, and people will freak out.
like with MSG, sweeteners. etc. 
I'm not anti-GMO but I fully believe that GMO foods need to be labeled.  The information to you MAY be meaningless but it may be very meaningful for certain groups.  For example, there are various portions of our population that hold that genetic engineering is wrong (from a religious view).  Why should they be forced to participate (buy food) that is GMO?


Hell, information on soil, water and air content of where the food was produced would be far more valuable. I want soil composition information on all food labels!
It was an example. The point of the matter is that absurd serving sizes are used. I bought a pizza the other day who's serving size was 1/9th.
That's what I used to think, until I got a call from Costco about the organic berries I purchased earlier this year.

http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2013/a1b-03-31/advice-consumers.html

I know it was a quality control issue, but still, scared me considerably because my pregnant wife was eating them.
I think he's saying that people who lean left tend to be more likely to be anti-GMO (not sure on those figures, personally) while the right-leaners have more or less cornered the market on climate change denial.
The funny thing is the same companies were claiming the same thing about ingredient lists on products decades ago.
Well, first check this out:
http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/p/450-published-safety-assessments.html

GMO's HAVE been researched. " Close to 30% of these publications are produced and funded by organisations that are completely independent of large commercial seed companies."

But, you bring up a good point. However you could say the same thing about just about everything. Every chemical, every TYPE of banana, every type of plastic... Where do you draw the line?
I see two issues with what you've said.  First, I'm not sure how you simply write 'GMO' on an ear of corn.  Moreover, it would require markets to segment their products as GMO organic, GMO, non-GMO, and non-GMO organic, which may or may not come as an inconvenience/cost to them.  Second, you are conflating the issue of simply 'it costs money' with 'it's literally a waste of money.'  If GMOs were dangerous, most people would not argue with a need for labeling.  Instead, labeling food as 'GMOs' is the same thing as labeling it with 'Some people have a negative opinion about this food, but this opinion is not backed by any data'.  As I mentioned earlier, it would be equally valid as labeling it with 'This food was picked by somebody with a water sign.  Beware Geminis!'
Not for the actual label. Anytime there is regulation, there will be increased costs. If I want to label my food as non-GM, then I have to check every ingredient in it.

Non-GM food also costs more to produce. Why do you think they're doing all the work to GM it in the first place?

I don't know what the cost would be, but it won't be zero.

The main thing though is that requiring labeling makes people scared of it. Companies are free to label their food as non-GM now, just like they're free to label it organic.
> But I would think that if the GMO-using companies believe that consuming GMOs is safe, then why is it a problem for them to be labeled?

I think they worry about the ignorance of the consumer and not the safety of the product. People have been working VERY hard to turn those 3 letters into an evil word and it has worked on a lot of people. Losing any business because your customer doesn't understand a label you are forced to add onto your product would be troubling for a business. Should they now have to spend millions to teach people what that actually means so they can learn to not fear the product?

[deleted]
The tricky part would be making sure that a revolving door didn't develop between this agency and the corporations that it was supposed to be regulating.  
We get larger, rounder tomatoes that taste bland because customers prefer to purchase them than smaller, tastier tomatoes.

That seems like a much cheaper alternative than pesticides. Is there any downsides to it?
How do you deal with mold and the bacteria present in the soil?
I think it's actually "known to cause cancer to the state of California", which is even funnier because it sounds like the state of California is some kind of conscious being.
That's why I oppose this bill; it doesn't give the consumer any useful information, it just promotes uninformed fearmongering.
He knows what they mean but what they mean is not even a real thing. The division between "Organic" and "non-Organic" food is arbitrary and made up by marketers. It's not based on reason, fact or science. 
(I just like using parenthesis) 
You're correct. However the synthetic/non-synthetic debate is completely irrelevant and arbitrary, as I'm sure you'll agree. Thinking that there is any *a priori* problem with synthetics is one of the most misguided, ignorant stances. 
You can look up the rules for being certified as organic in your state or country. It varies from area to area somewhat though.
[An episode of Bullshit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5amLAMRQk5I), a [report by the university of california](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html) and [a study on the enviromental inpact published the university of guelph](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/organic-pesticides-can-be-worse-than-synthetic-study/article4322612/)
That's not exactly true either. The real truth is somewhere between what you and /u/psb31 said. Yes monsanto is making crops round-up ready and farmers are using more round-up because of it, but they use fewer other herbicides. Besides that, it's the pesticides I'm more worried about, and gmo's are cutting down on pesticide use. Take the example of corn rootworm, a multi-billion dollar a year pest. Companies are working on ways to make corn resistant to the corn rootworm--doing so would mean less pesticide needed and potentially billions of dollars of lost corn crop saved every year.
Roundup is an herbicide, not a pesticide.  It kills weeds, not bugs.
This. The problem is Dr_JA and NotTheBatman's arguments are right theoretically but in practice......
I would argue that the big supermarket chains will only be byeing off the major biochip companies rather than supporting the small companies. So the regulation argument dosn't hold sway unless consumers and farmers could get modified seeds that reproduce with the plants.

With a western controlled food supply chain of around 1.5 billion people traits will be selected for increased quantity of calories (modified starch anyone?), and bulk weight of plant. This reduces the pressure on the food system but also I would argue leads to less nutritious food. 

We consumers will have no idea what we're buying. 


Let's put it this way; how do you think consumers would react to all peppermint being labeled "This plant altered through genetic damage caused by radiation"?  I think having verticillium wilt resistant peppermint is great, and a useful trait.  

I oppose GMO labeling, because it singles out one method of producing a trait, it labels a method, not a result.  Here's an example, if you had a mutation bred, a genetically engineered and a crossbred variety of verticillum resistant mint, under GMO labeling laws only the GM mint would be labeled, even if the resistance gene is the same for all plants.  
Because it doesn't provide any useful information to the consumer.  The same reason the government shouldn't mandate that all meat should include a graphic description of the slaughtering process on its packages.  That information, while true, will just serve to scare off the consumer while providing no additional information regarding its nutrition or safety in return.
Except bacteria transferring genes into other cells is likely what enabled our existence to begin with, since all Eukaryotas have a mitochondria, which was likely at some point a bacterium of it's own.  So, in a way, everything already has bacterial DNA in us.

Also, quite honestly it doesn't matter where the DNA comes from.  DNA is just instructions.  Nothing more, nothing less.

Domestic turkeys are incapable of mating because they're too big.
> corn and Bacillus thuringiensis is not something that can fuck and procreate. My concern is less about what's going to happen to me and more for the ecological impact. **This has not been well studied.**

it's been EXHAUSTIVELY studied (emphasis mine). bt corn won't hurt you. bt is considered GRAS by the EPA, which is a high-level requirement for edibility. there have been numerous metabolic studies on bt endotoxin (the monsanto people hate calling it that because it has the word 'toxin' in it), and both the chemical itself and its metabolites (secondary chemicals produced in your liver) are safe for human consumption. [[source]](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/crops/00707.html)

it might mess up migratory insects though. 

Genecially modifying foods kills human embryos?
Only partially - the belief/fear is that if stem cells are found to be as useful as believed, then an ethical quagmire would ensue regarding acquisition of stem cells - specifically their source.

Outspoken members of the pro-life movement think that stem cells would be farmed as a byproduct of abortions. Worse, they believe that it would increase the frequency and change the image of abortion, regarding it as some kind of human harvesting business. Yeah...it's a little over the top.
It's more of the taboo of the source of the stem cells 
People don't realize it, but:  
>If you say, cross two different strains of seeds together (as we've been doing for thousands and thousands of years), you're breeding an entirely new plant.  

is how we got bananas. They don't have seeds (anymore) and new trees are grown by cloning existing ones.
Thank you, we've been genetically modifying crops since the beginning of agriculture. But since the Evul Corpurashuns are making GMOs for PROpHETS they must be bad!!1!
The guidelines and regulations we have now are fine. Know how many medically documented cases there are of people getting sick from an allergic reaction to a GMO food? Zero. In more than forty *years* of commercial availability.

Why do you think we need to do better than that? *How* could we do better than that?
The FDA or the USDA, depending on the foodstuff in question, but yes.
Conventional breeding works by reinforcing existing traits. A lot of those traits come from mutations that would not naturally be beneficial for the plant, but are desirable from a breeding point of view, i.e. a mutation that makes the fruit larger or better tasting.

It's not impossible that a plant could spontaneously mutate a gene that, through some incredible coincidence, caused its cells to glow, but at the same time it's not impossible that the same plant could mutate the genes to sprout human arms. If it happened, then you could use conventional breeding techniques like cloning to reinforce the mutation.
If I read that right, the FDA is saying all food contains genetically modified ingredients, unless is was picked from wild plants. Interesting.
Interesting Boingboing article.
[The Case of the Poison Potato](http://boingboing.net/2013/03/25/the-case-of-the-poison-potato.html)
Humans share nearly 55% of our genetic code with banana trees.  That doesn't make us less human.

Furthermore.. we've been breeding hybrid plants and animals for a very, very long time.  Mules are donkey/horse hybrids.  Nectarines are peach-plum hybrids.  Wheat, grapefruit, and peppermint are all hybrids of different plant species.  Etc.
You should probably just assume it has GMO unless it goes out of its way to say it doesn't.
They certainly should have access to the information, but labeling it on the products themselves is unnecessary, as it hardly holds *any* information that is relevant to the consumer. The chance on misinterpretation of the label is so high it will **more likely misinform the consumer** than actually inform them, because of random claims that GMOs are dangerous in any way.
 
GMO doesn't deserve all the worry and caution it's surrounded with, it only causes a distorted image of what GMOs really are.
Should we say on every packaging, "This food was potentially packaged by a Muslim." No because it doesn't matter at all. It just scares the uneducated away from a valid product.
Yeah, but that isn't a valid dietary concern. 

Peanuts? Yes, people can be allergic. 

High fructose corn syrup? Not really, but it's an ingredient so it gets listed. 

Dairy? Both. 

GMO? No, it's no different than any other ingredient and it covers literally everything. There is no food that humans eat that hasn't been modified genetically one way or another.
People who are concerned about the effects of GMO can demand that foods be labeled, and the market will provide them with foods that are labeled as non-GMO. But to get the government to create a regulation that forces companies to label, anti-GMO people should be required to provide evidence of potential harm from GMO. 
But where do we draw the line?

People have been selectively harvesting crops for their genes for centuries. Hell, most of my favorite kinds of apple's weren't around until the 1950's.

GMOs are just the next stupid hype train for dumb, self-absorbed wannabe environmentalists who've watched far too much Food Inc. and haven't read a book in their damn life.
There are three reasons people use the labels on foods:

1. To see if the nutritional value fits their diet
1. To see if the ingredients fit their ethical framework (e.g. Jews avoiding non-kosher ingredients)
1. To see if the ingredients are harmful to their health (e.g. avoiding reactions to peanut allergies)

Most people don't worry about any of these, but we still should require that the information be given so people can make an informed decision based on any or all of those criteria.

That said, I don't see how GMO fits any of these. The current labelling already fits No.1, there's no evidence of No.3, and I don't see what ethical problems you could have with GMO that you wouldn't already be informed about when looking at the name of the manufacturer.
Ok, what if natural gene slicing occurs? Say, a retrovirus carry a beneficial gene naturally infects a strain of corn, and confers a resistance to a disease currently harming those crops like Goss's Wilt. Would that genetically modified? It's a completely *natural* process, but it splices genes and inserts genetic material from a different organism. If that's considered unsafe or unnatural, what does that mean for humans, whose genome is approximately 8% retroviral DNA and whose survival literally *depends* on that DNA? If it isn't considered a GMO, then why would guiding that process in order to insert positive traits onto crops be considered quantitatively different than simply allowing it to occur naturally? Like I said, saying something is genetically modified is a useless term without more information.

You need to get more educated on this subject matter.
Selective breeding genetically modifies the genome...
And the insertion of proviral material into a plants genome has been occurring naturally for billions of years. It's literally those inserted genes which *keep humans alive*. 
I just wanted to let you know that I agree with you in theory. More information for the consumer is always a good thing. Encourages informed decisions. Sure the chances of reactionary bollocks is always there, but we haven't even been Gene-modding foods for a generation yet. There are always unknowns. No matter how perfect the plan, we never know as much as we think we do. 
I should have included the full terms - thanks for the assist :D
Nobody forces them. They can buy organic if some of the ingredients are available in GMO form.

On the other hand, various portions of the population hold meat not slaughtered in certain ways to be unclean. Should we force every meat packet to be labelled "non-halal" and "non-kosher", or should we just accept that that segment can probably figure it out themselves, and that some manufacturers will see the market in producing halal and kosher meat?
That is an extremely small group.  If they are legitimately concerned, it should be up to them to know which foods they can and cannot eat.  By your logic, companies should also label their foods if they contain wheat produced in Illinois, because some people don't like the state and don't want to support it.

It's unnecessary to label GMOs, and causes far more harm than good.
Should government regulation be used to force manufacturers to label the way you want?

Why can't manufacturs respond to the needs and wants of their customers?  If the customer want the labeling they will ask for it.  Their purchases will trend towards products that meet their needs.
It creates a false dichotomy and enables the baseless anti-GMO fear-mongering.
Should it also label food that was handled by a black guy? Or food that was shipped by a Puerto Rican? Or food that was packaged by a woman? Consumers should be able to have that knowledge too. /s

fuck man, I WANT THE GENOME OF MY PLANTS LISTED! WHY IS BIG AGRI TRYING TO TAKE AWAY MY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION!?
I bought a bag of sweets (small gummy things) that listed the portion size as 7 sweets. Nobody in the history of anything considers that an actual portion.
1/9th is weird, but 1/10th or 1/8th would be fair serving sizes if the pizza was cut into 10 or 8 slices, respectively.
My comment was directed more at companies like Pepsi, Coke, and Nestle who are specifically mentioned in the article, since they don't sell vegetables, they sell processed foods.  Secondly, it is no harder to put any of those labels on a sticker, exactly as is done for organic or not organic produce right now, by choice.  I'm not confusing "it costs money" with "it wastes money" as a company's decision to put "light" or "fat free" on a product may or may not be informational at all based on what product it is.  All of this is very subjective as to what is valuable and what is a waste of money. 

More importantly, I don't disagree with the sentiment that labeling it as a GMO food is really not informative.  My point was about the argument from the companies that say "it will cost so much" is a faulted argument based on things they already spend money on that could be, or are, equally as wasteful.
Nuked. XD
Heirloom Tomatoes are often ugly and have uneven shapes and color, but are SO much better than the hothouse grown ones.
Probably only works for acre plots. Sounds like a fun place to be though. Vegetables, chickens, and a dog... pretty fun
That sounds delightful. Can I live with your friend?
Do the coyotes not pose a threat to the dog too? Because that is a HUGE problem in my neighborhood. Dogs disappear all the time. People still put up posters for them, but we all know what happened...

So I got a guard horse for my guard dogs. (Okay, none of them are guard animals, but the horse does scare off coyotes.) I guess if your friend has a big enough dog, that'll work too, but you should tell him he should consider a guard horse. They also make excellent lawnmowers (and more fertilizer than you'll ever know what to do with). The whole "insanely expensive to own" bit is just a minor detail, right?
Enormous sheets of fabric were impossible to produce (or absurdly expensive) without modern technology.

IIRC pesticide is actually a general term for herbicide and insecticide. Insecticide means it kills insects.
I understand that I was using pesticide as a general term for shit they spray to prevent weed/bugs/diseases.
Or it might inform people that their food is provided with humane/inhumane methods in sanitary/unsanitary conditions. As a consumer, I prefer to make my own decisions, not allow them to be made for me.

So is it just an issue of them being too large to properly maneuver for cloaca contact? Because I have a picture in my head, and it's hilarious. 
The thing is, we've no idea if traditional methods are worse or not. We've messing with the ecology forever. If GM crops need less pesticide, for instance, then isn't that likely to improve the local ecology?


There are some completely obvious things that have massive negative impact, such as that kudzu weed in Georgia, and then there are things like global warming that are killing the coral reefs. It's just so difficult to study in total, and there's so little real data available, that we could say that almost everything we do is having a negative impact on the ecology.


What we really need is more funding for environmental and earth science research. Better technology, and improving ability to deal with large data sets, is improving what can be done.

>My concern is *less about what's going to happen to me* and **more for the ecological impact.**

>it might mess up migratory insects though.

Dude. Remember the part about how I said I'm more concerned about the ecological impact? That's what I was referring to not being well studied. 
If you smack an embryo with a giant modified tuna, then yes

Stem cells are not embryos.
No, science illiteracy. 
So many would have you believe.
What really sucks is that embryonic stem cells don't come from abortions. They are derived from left over fertilized eggs from people who underwent in-vitro fertilization and are obtained with full consent by the donor. These cells are only really about a week old after conception. You don't even find out if you're pregnant until two weeks after conception! So by the time somebody gets an abortion, the fetus's cells are too differentiated/old to be considered embryonic stem cells. 
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell
Wait, we crossed two different strains of seeds to get bananas?  That's bananas.
Actually that's probably the most valid aspect of GMO criticism. Multinational corporations have shown countless times to partake in deeply unethical practices in the pursuit of profit with little regard for ecological impact and people's well-being and their rights. Considering how little control we have even over our own government there is a lot to be said for demanding very strict controls and transparency in the case of GMOs. 

This is not some kind of "ignorance", it springs from what we know about human nature and the highly valid fear of the possibility of *yet another* man-made ecological disaster. GMO opponents don't want to abolish GMO, rather they want way stricter control mechanisms and transparency given what we have seen so far how corporations work.
Its not impossible that rainbows will suddenly shoot out of my penis hole, but it is more probable that said rainbows will give everyone around me cancer than fill their pockets with skittles.
True. Obviously not every bit of DNA in each species is unique to that species. But if you spliced the code from bananas into my own that caused me to smell like a banana, that would make me less human because it's unlikely that any naturally occurring human gene would cause that particular trait. This is a major debate in the biotech world - whether technological augmentation of humans lessens their humanity. When it comes to prosthetic limbs I don't think so, but it gets dicey when you get into things that get perpetuated by reproduction.
Exactly. That is the fad anyway, if you want non GMO food just buy the expensive stuff labeled as such. There is no need to start labeling GMO foods.
> The chance on misinterpretation of the label is so high it will more likely misinform the consumer than actually inform them, because of random claims that GMOs are dangerous in any way.

Yup.  It's like a law that would require a doctor to give you a list of the ingredients of a vaccination before giving you the vaccination.  The average person is not qualified to determine whether those ingredients are beneficial, just as they are not qualified to determine whether GMO is harmful.

It's just a scare tactic being lobbied for by (ironically) organic food producers, who have managed to astroturf environmental organizations to their benefit.
"Gosh darnit, I don't want to have anything to do with them halal apples!"
Funny thing about that is, you'll never hear one of the anti-GMO people pushing for mandatory labels point to studies [like this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16779644) and talk about the consumer's 'right to know.'
I just don't understand why people who would like to be informed about what they put into their body is called anti-science, fearmongering etc...We are even lumped together with anti-vaccine group so we could be ridiculed. 
And there are religious groups that can't eat food that is not kosher or halal, so food that is, is labeled as such. Other products don't need a big " not kosher" or "not halal" sign. I am all for allowing non gmo foods to be able to state that they are non gmo but that is not what is being pushed
> it should be up to them to know which foods they can and cannot eat

Which would be kind of hard without proper labeling.

i'm glad i had not yet taken a drink of my coffee or else it'd be on the screen.
I'm pretty sure the controversy with stem cell research is with embryonic stem cells, not adult stem cells.
This this this. 

Also up until Obama took office no new cell lines were even being started meaning you had 8+ years of slowed down research that did not use any eggs. This whole "killing embryos" rhetoric was garbage and had no scientific backing. If a 2-4 day ball of cells that wouldn't be able to fully develop into a person is killing life then I might as well be committing mass murder every day when I watch porn. 
I'm much more concerned with concentrated international corporations gaining a stronghold in the food market than with eating GMOs. At least now there's a level of oversight and consumer protection, not to mention the farmers themselves. It wouldn't be too difficult for large Agro Corps to monopolize the food growing business. I can't imagine what would happen if some sort of future legislation gave Agro Corporations immunities in the future that allowed them to 'inspect' their own crops and control their pricing (because capitalism and conservative economic policies). We can't assume corporations will do the right thing when there's a monetary gain to be had. What could the price of an apple be? What about a strawberry-banana hybrid? Food prices in general could rise dramatically, or they could fall dramatically. It all depends whether or not the government retains control over private food growing corporations or not...and it wouldn't take much to ensure that they don't.
> shown countless times to partake in deeply unethical practices in the pursuit of profit

That should be the label on the food instead of GMO warnings
I don't see that as making you any less human at all. Imo: if anything, it's make you more banana, but that's addition, not subtraction.
Right, it should be treated the same as Kosher foods.

If your crazy religion dictates your food be a certain way, then you get to buy foods specifically identified as such, you don't get to force everyone else's food to accommodate your crazy religious beliefs.
I believe doctors are required to provide that information upon request.
I am legitimately pro-GMO. Without dwarf-wheat the world would be a much worse place. Regardless of any cancers it may or may not cause, people are alive for decades and get to have a life as opposed to rotting in stomach churning anguish before melting away into bones. I am however, not beyond thinking a corporation would cut a few corners in order to more efficiently make a buck. Anyone that denies the chance for consequences is deluding themselves into a security that is all to easily ruffled. Err on the side of caution while moving forward, as it is the one that will be the least likely to see us all dead.
No, its not. Assume GMO unless otherwise stated; its that widespread now.
It is trivial. Buy non-GMO or Organic, or products for which GM varieties do not exist.

Voluntary labels work for gluten free, kosher, halal, strict vegan, and other diets that require more information than is on the mandatory label. People get by just fine with this, without forcing everything else to be labeled "non-kosher."
No. If it's not organic and has a few major ingredients in it, it's GMO. If it's organic, it's not GMO. Done.
Couldn't the larger area be broken down into smaller plots with hedgerows between to provide even greater biodiversity?

While I agree with most of what you've said in this thread, I must point out that, by your own arguments on dwarf wheat, you are "pro-Selective-Breeding", not "pro-GMO". There's a big difference (or, at least, there should be). As of 2013, [GM-wheat has never been grown commercially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_wheat).
Then you can put a small house on each plot, and a farmer could live in it.

That's where a distinction should be made. Most people I know who are against embryonic stem cell research still donate cord blood and give to adult stem cell research, but if there are people who are ignorant of the difference, they should be informed.
Some do, some don't.  Take a look at this:

My favorite has to be the Liberal column for embryonic vs. non-embryonic.
As far as I'm aware, it's also different because, unlike the physician's vaccine, the grocer doesn't have to maintain documentation on all the GMO products available in their store, so that information wouldn't be available from the grocer, *even upon request*.
Ah, yeah.  Fair point. Should have caught that. It was meant to be an example,  I suppose Bt corn and cotton would have worked as well, but then you get into the miasma of corporate greed and the entire argument becomes wholly obscured by people hating on biotechnology companies rather than the applications of their work. Was playing it safe with dwarf wheat. I am properly ashamed. 
But really I'm not actually your friend

Interesting read. Especially to hear that those on the left are opposed to non-embryonic stem cell research. As I don't see that having any negative moral implication at all. The entire field of study from the material itself to reaction and reception is just really intriguing to me. 
Thats crap. Coca Cola isnt part of the Whipped group, the Congealed group, *or* the Choco-tastic group.

It's made out of vegetables, like corn.
Wait, how you anyone in a health or fitness field possibly say that coca-cola is healthy with a straight face? I'm not saying people shouldn't be allowed to drink it because do whatever the Hell you want but don't do so under the assumption that it's healthy, it is NOT healthy at all.
They should add electrolytes.  
> Flipse has worked with Coca-Cola and the American Beverage Association for years; her roles have included sending out messages on social media refuting the idea that sugary drinks are to blame for obesity and making herself available as an expert for news outlets. If a story says something negative about artificial sweeteners, Flipse said she might contact the PR agency and ask, "*Do you want me to do something about that?*"

Wow, anything for money.

Kellogg and General Mills can do this.  Put pictures of fresh fruits on the box and the word natural and suckers will buy it.  Soda will be much harder to trick people.
Is that when they aren't assassinating union workers in South America?

When consumed as a treat - something only consumed infrequently and in small quantities Coke is not necessarily unhealthy. It’s really only when one frequently consumes a big gulp that it becomes so.
I have a friend who runs ultra marathons and triathalons. He drinks one coke every day. It is his one indulgence but I think running 10 miles in the morning and 10 in the evening off sets it. 
Doctors are stupid.  I get my health information from celebs.

Well technically Coke does have less sugar than fruit drinks. 
I jog 60 minutes at the gym and use about 1.5 liters of water during that time (though I do chug most right after) meaning I burn about 400-500 calories. If I drank 1.5 liters of coke that's adding 600 calories, meaning I'd end up with more than I started, FUCK THAT. Think about that the next time you drink soda, or are bulking, you're welcome for all that heart burn while you run.
Virtually every single product company has paid brand ambassadors that spew messages they don't necessarily believe in.

Not sure why Coke would / should be any different.

Not excusing the behavior, but the surprise / sanctimony here is surprising.

Snorting coke can help you lose weight
Why does reddit continue to be flabbergasted by such obvious stuff? 
Coke *can* be used as a snack. Think 90 minutes into a 2.5 hr workout when your eyes can't focus anymore and you have tunnel vision... A coke works well to get you over that hump
Anyone dumb enough to think Coke is the healthy choice probably believes things even more likely to be bad for them haha
Headline: Company uses massive profits to manipulate consumers. 

...I'm shocked. 
Where can I find an advertisement toutin coca cola is a healthy treat in the U S?
Brush you teeth with Coca-Cola™! It's great for your teeth, trust me I'm dentist.
This is why you shouldn't believe things based on what experts say. Do your own research, use common sense.  
For profit media gonna profit.


If coke wants to weed out the stupid people by telling them that I'm all for it.
Almost every large food company does this, this isn't unique to Coca-Cola.
Like anyone will ever believe Coke is healthy.  Nothing is healthy anymore unless it comes from all natural ingredients grown on a sacred hippie mountaintop and was tested to be gluten free
Why bother? Soda is unhealthy, everyone knows it, just keep doing what your doing. You still make plenty of money.
Coke.. Healthy.. Hahahahahahaha any idiot should know All soda is terrible for you and you shouldn't even really drink it often. 
This is news?
In other news, rain is just water that falls from the sky. 
I used to compete in bicycle racing. After a one or two hour bike race (a very intense exertion) I'd drink a small can of Coke and I tell you what, it felt like drinking a god damn mana potion. Coke will never taste better in your life than when you've just finished some kind of intense workout that has depleted your muscle glycogen (going anaerobic for like half an hour total). 

I never knew it was so good until one of my team mates told me about it. Oh man, I fell in love with Coke. So, there really are some truly applicable uses of coke for healthy people. (If you ever watch professional bike races, or probably other endurance sports, you'll see the riders being given various types of drinks by their team support immediately after finishing. Coke is one of the most popular. I still think it's just because coke is the most popular/common soft drink. 
Of all the corporate lobbying that goes on in the world, this one makes me the least angry. If you're too stupid to understand the nutritional impact of Coke when it's printed on the fucking label then fuck you.
Its got electrolytes in it.
Why? Coca-cola could literally never do any PR, any adverts, or any marketing whatsoever anymore until the end of time and still turn profits every year.
That's not even a stretch. That's pants-on-head retarded.
Hahaha oh my goodness. Who would even believe that coke is a healthy snack?  There goes wasted ad money... they'd be better off spending it doing awesome promos like Bud Light.
I think "treat" should be the operative word, have it every once in a while. Not 3 cans a day.
Whomever they are paying must be doing a piss poor job because I've literally never heard anyone even remotely state that cola is a "healthy treat".
It is time we as consumers moved on from Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.
Nothing screams healthy like 140 calories, 45 mg of sodium, and 39 g of carbs and sugar per 12 ounce serving. 
Actually having a Coke after a workout along with an quick absorbing protein such as whey will aid in shuttling amino acids and glycogen to muscle tissue to begin the repair process. 

 It CAN be a healthy treat, but only if consumed after a weight lifting or intense cardio session.

EDIT: holy downvote.. talk about people not wanting to hear the truth. Suit yourselves..
Put a 40% tax on soda, including Coke. It's absolutely laughable how cigarettes have been demonized but Coca Cola is considered as American as apple pie and Chevrolet. 

It's one of the *main* reasons that Americans are fat as shit and obesity is such an epidemic, diabetes is at record levels and kids' teeth are falling out in a lot of regions in America. 

But cigarettes are evil and Coke is "Americana." Right? 

Obesity kills. Diabetes kills. Heart disease kills. Coke can cause all of these things and people treat it like it's some cute, harmless indulgence. It's not. Tax the fuck out of it. 
[Just look at the killer diet these Colombian union-organizers discovered with Coca-Cola.](http://colombiajournal.org/colombia73.htm)
Will coca cola ever entirely separate from its origins as a snake oil product?
I mean technically there is nothing wrong or too unhealthy with having like ONE coke every couple of days, or like a can a week. But that's not what Coca-Cola wants, now is it?
I recently gave up diet soda and feel better than ever.  
Who cares, I still celebrate a win with a bottle of coke. 

*#GlassBottlesYo*
Meh. the only time I drink Coke is with rum. I drink a nice tall glass of Cuba Libre every night. Still Healthy.
[deleted]
But why would someone who can read the ingredients for themselves believe coke is a healthy treat? Regardless of who endorses it?
How the fuck would anyone believe that?
I mean it has water, that is healthy, right?  Right?
> the American Pistachio Growers has quoted a dietitian for the New England Patriots in a piece on healthy snacks and recipes

Are pistachios not healthy snacks?
Comparatively speaking, cola is a healthy alternative to a diet of used motor oil 
I remember Jay Cutler's diet in a published work said that he drank like three cans a day. I had always been skeptical
Healthy? This isn't a comparison. 
But science is so pure. There is no way scientists would ever lie about anything. Science, unlike every other pursuit of mankind, IS NOT FOR SALE! 
Cool, who cares about being apart of the obesity epidemic... all that matters is $elling more $oda!
Serious fitness question. For the past couple months I've made an effort to do *some* kind of physical activity for for at least 30 min a day. 95% of the time this is in the form of taking a walk.

I limit my soda intake by only buying a 32 pack (from Costco, bulk non-perishables FTW) every other month, so on average I only have a soda every other day. Some days more frequently, some days less, but I only restock on sodas every other month, so when I'm out, I'm out.

What sort of impact does this have on my health? My assumption would be that it is almost entirely negligible.
LoL there's the part in Fed Up where they ask a so-called expert ... his reaction is priceless. 
Yea but does it have electrolytes?
Motion to have their entire corporate staff dragged into the street and shot? I'm particularly thinking of that incident where they sent death squads into columbia, but this is mildly shitty too. 
   As a kid, my dentist told me to do the experiment:  Place a tooth in coke and watch what happens.   That made me stop drinking soda.   Coke has now become some dentists best friend- as it drives drinkers of that stuff to them in droves.
It doesn't have to be ethical or truthful to be barely legal. Get educated and the truth shall set you free. Don't expect a giant corporation to do it for you.
Not entirely sure why Coca-Cola would want to do that or why they think anyone would take a fitness expert peddling coke seriously. Everyone knows its bad for you but like, McDonalds, but you keep going back because you are addicted to it like crack.
Today on reddit: a massive corporation pays off scientists to say that whatever they're selling is not harmful to your health/environment/privacy/mind/waistline/wallet. Otherwise known as every other day on reddit.
I wonder why they didn't cozy up with professional cyclers (who drink that stuff WHILE COMPETING IN A RACE). 
To be fair, anyone that actually believed this is a fucking moron.
Is anyone else disgusted by the "while your tongue is young" campaign? I feel like its a direct advertisement to children. It makes me sick every time I see it. 
They're a huge company right? They have tons of cash right? Why don't they design a version of coke marketed towards athletes, call it "Coke Charged" or something? Make it taste like coke but be all healthy and stuff with the electrolytes and whatnot, they could serve it in coolers at sports games... like gatorade. If anybody wants to know they could say they got a bunch of kick ass scientists to turn coke into a sports drink, who cares right? They're a big company and we'd all believe they could do it. All they'd need is to sign some popular athletes to drink it and a cool ass logo. I'd probably at least try some.
They have also participated in private expropriation of public water resources which is gonna be more and more painful to learn about in an ever-increasingly water-scarce world.
This actually doesn't even slightly surprise me. 
If they pay me, I will say that too.
The most healthy thing about Coca-Cola is the can. 
Coca-Cola has few ethics. Read [The Coke Machine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1583334351/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?qid=1426556745&sr=8-3&keywords=the+coke+machine&pi=AC_SY200_QL40) for more. 
Need to expose the health and fitness guys in order to deter any new expert suggestions.
I once heard on obs that this 'expert' suggests drinking soda is good for kids after exercise so that the kids get hydrated. Fucking bitch.
Who the hell would believe that shit? 

I mean, I know that Coca-Cola is about as unhealthy as it comes. Doesn't stop me from drinking two cans a day (as well as 4 bottles of water). 
It's part of a balanced breakfast!

I totally believe it w/o reading the article yet. Look at this picture I took as I was walking into a Walmart.

A 12oz can of Coke has 45mg of Sodium.  That is no where near enough salt for a proper rehydration mix.
You would have to be really dumb to think caffeinated sugar water is healthy 
So glad that this gets more coverage on this biased sub than the Senate Democrats trying to block a medicare bill. GD some people are ridiculous.

If you believe fizzy sugar water is healthy you are a moron.
There are few things finer than a cold Coca Cola in a glass bottle after a long summer bike ride.

How do 'sugar free' alternatives fit into this?

Diet coke, coke zero, coke life etc. are they any better for you/ better to drink?

Is weight control is a simple calories in/calories out equation then surely drinking diet coke is better than drinking say squash and cordial?
My five kidney stones would disagree. 
it's really??
ahhhhh, so that's how they were going about it.

I was driving north on I5 leaving portland last spring when a podcast story came out about coca cola trying to rebrand itself into a "sweet treat." 

They talked about new media, new bottle shapes, all engineered to paint a new image of coca cola as a reward type thing. they even interviewed the CEO, who only drinks 1 coke a day now! oh my! it's necessary though, apparently americans are drinking 50% less coke than we were in the 90's IIRC.

of course, just paying people to "most doctors smoke camel" works too.
Okay... so after my doc told me in late November that I had NAFLD (non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) - a common affliction among slightly overweight people with an excess of visceral lipids - I decided to give up drinking alcohol, you know, to take a bit of the stress off of my liver.  At the same time, I decided to also quit drinking any other kind of potable calories... milk, juice, lattes, hot chocolate, soda, etc., and instead drink water with a little bit of apple cider vinegar in it (the organic kind, with live acetobacter and vinegar mother).

I changed nothing else; I continue to eat as I always have, whatever I want with a side of anything I bloody well please; I exercise lightly to moderately, but no more regularly than ever... and... lo and behold, over the last few months I've dropped over 25 pounds - more than 10% of my body weight, **a LARGE Butterball Turkey.**

Now, I wasn't really much of a soda drinker to begin with, because let's face it, even back then I knew it wasn't *good for you.*  But what I've discovered is sugared drink is literally #1 on my weight gain list.  Whether that is because of its effects on my insulin response, my metabolism, or a simple overabundance of easy calories, I couldn't say, but the idea that soda is a *healthy treat* goes beyond stretching reality, well into the realm of the insidious, absurd, malignant.

Drink soda if you want, but don't kid yourself.
Did anyone else think their whole "Mixify" release was a huge load of crap? I was like "Okay, if you need an app to help you track calories in order to drink more soda, you already have a problem." If soda just diappeared off the face of the earth one day, we would all be perfectly fine. Mixify seems to suggest that soda is somehow essential to our diet. Wtf.
I drink coca-cola before i exercise because i can never get enough sleep to be motivated. After the first 3 sips, I'm ready to roll. Coca-Cola helped me get in shape, but will eventually get dropped once I find out m
For shame, at least real cocaine has no calories.
As a fitness expert, this is obviously silly.

As a shareholder in Coca Cola, this is obviously awesome.

Life just cain't be simple.
Coca Cola - It's got what cows crave.
Let's be real. WHo would believe them?
lol srsly? I clicked myself into these comments with the full expectation that the top comment would be something like: "title is inaccurate, just trying to ignite an anti-corporate circlejerk". like seriously?
>For Coca-Cola Co., the public relations strategy with health experts in February focused on the theme of "Heart Health & Black History Month." The effort yielded a radio segment and multiple online pieces.
>

I can't be the only person who sees how evil that is..especially with blacks having the highest rate of heart issues currently in America...
I always wonder whether reading articles like this will actually make people internalize the facts about the drink and drink them less, or provide a cue that ends up working just like an ad, and has them drink more of it.
Ya pretty sure any fitness or health professional that told me that I would get up and leave the room without question. 
It's funny because I made this point a month or two ago on reddit under the premise that Coca Cola are horrible misleading people and got the "nobody would think coke is healthy..."
Surprise surprise? Srsly that's nothing new.
There's nothing wrong with having a nice cold coke for yourself - *in moderation.* 

You wouldn't eat chocolate cake with every breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day of you life would you? Of course not, no one except people with eating disorders do that.

So Coca-Cola isn't necessarily wrong, it's just that sugar is crack to certain folks and they should be staying away from sugary, fat laden foods anyway.

I don't really see the issue.
A corrupt mega company?!?!?   I don't believe it.
one day....people like you and me, will get together as many did in crucial points in history, and absolutely destroy any and all aspects of unhealthy unsustainable. IM SO SICK OF THIS SHIT
Did you go to the Hollywood Upstairs Medical College too?

[Here](http://www.livepositively.com/content/dam/live-positively/files/hydration-tips.pdf) are some more hydration tips from Coke! Their *concern* is so over the top, it's creepy.

5 Min Edit: Added relevant [Coca Cola hydro info here.](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/101039/the-hydration-warswar-is-peace.html)

Quote: *Not so, counters the CSPI, claiming each bottle of Vitaminwater, whose various flavors and hues do bear a passing resemblance to Kool-Aid, possesses 33 grams of sugar. "I was attracted by the prospect of getting extra vitamins," says James Koh, a San Francisco resident and plaintiff in the suit. "But I had no idea that I was actually getting almost a Coke's worth of sugar and calories. There's no way I would have spent money on that, had I known."*

Edit: Wiki quote *Coca-Cola dismissed the allegations as "ridiculous," on the grounds that "no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking Vitaminwater was a healthy beverage" and an attempt by the group to increase its readership.*
I remember this.  It was part of their "Hey, at least it's a liquid" campaign.
That link now goes to [here](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/contact-us/faqs), and the total number of times that either "hydrate", "hydration", or "hydrating" shows up out of 8700 total words is.... one time.
This reminds me of the KFC commercial I saw once. ONCE. I think it may have been pulled due to outright bullshit.

From what I remember, it was a man and woman working out, then cut to them eating KFC while a voice over states how healthy KFC is, how much protein it has and what it doesn't have.

It was just bullshit. I thought I was watching MadTV or SNL. If I could find the video, I'd link it.
They're right. The primary ingredient is water. A little caffeine and food coloring does not eliminate that. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11022872
> It’s truly hard to control cravings because high fructose corn syrup slows down the secretion of leptin in the body. Leptin is a crucial hormone in the body that tells you that you’re full and to stop eating. That’s why it’s so closely associated with obesity in this country. It’s like an addictive drug.

I love it how even Coca Cola corporation assumes that people that drink it are dumbasses.
So? They aren't wrong. The myth that soda dehydrates you is pervasive amongst the ignorant.
Who were they kidding thinking people would type that whole thing out in their browser?

Also coke didn't have coke.com?

Also a hyphen??
Or you know.. you can use water..
Coke is hydrating. Probably not the best beverage, but the myth that only water is hydrating has been dispelled. On a side note, 8 glasses of water was also bullshit with no scientific basis. It's supposed to be a six pack of Coke a day. 
Yeah this it what I remember being bullshit. Idk what people are talking about with the caffeine in it being a diuretic, that just means your bladder absorbs the water faster and makes you need to pee instead of your body getting the good water.

I think that because coke has more dissolved solutes, the osmolarity is higher and the net flow of water into the body is greatly diminished. Idk for sure but this had always been my theory. 
It's sweetened with ~~HFCS~~ vegetable juice...
Corn is a grain.
"Coca Cola is healthier than drinking gasoline.".... Face didn't even flinch. Tongue, however, remains firmly planted in cheek.
Have you met a personal trainer?  They are the used car salesmen of the gym. 
An occasional  coke can be a *treat* that's part of a healthy diet. The problem is people who drink it all the time as a substitute for water. Orange Juice is okay to drink a small glass sometomes with breakfast, but drinking tons of it is horrible for you because it has even more sugar than coke. Moderation is  key. Drink water 95 percent of the time, but it's perfectly healthy to have a treat when you're eating an otherwise well balanced calorie concious diet..

If you're drinking too much soda try switching to naturally flavored unsweetened  sparkling water. It takes awhile to get your taste buds adapted to it, but I at least learned to love it. A nice glass of sparkling water with lime is where it's at.

Is there not a national licensing agency or organization for these people? 
if you're an endurance athlete and you burn through all your glycogen after, say a 3 hour high intensity bike race, sugary soda is perfectly fine. 
How can anyone in media call sponsored content and so-called native advertising anything but propaganda? 
Everyone has a price
*Wait, how you anyone in a health or fitness field possibly say that coca-cola is healthy with a straight face?*

Money. 


I'm guessing the ones who are getting paid by Coke to say that. for enough money I'd praise it as healthy too. 
I quit soda for two years before my current boyfriend found out i adore dr pepper and bought me some glass bottled dr pep. 

I quit drinking soda 2 weeks ago and im very sad :( 

But its for my health, so its worth it
Once or twice a week, I'll use a coke to pour into my protein in a shaker. The sugars and carbonation allow for insulin transport to muscles and help build. So in that sense, it's healthy. Everything in moderation, right?
There definitely needs to be some regulatory body for these "professionals" saying things like this, that reprimands their own for saying things like this. 
It's also not unhealthy as a once in a while treat.
Coca-Cola isnt unhealthy in moderation. Much like anything else.

A shot of coke per day probably doesnt have any adverse side effects over the long term.

It stands to reason that as an occassional treat, there is nothing wrong with it. Although a "Healthy Treat" it is not. It is an "Unhealthy Treat in Moderation that will have no adverse side effects"
It's healthy for my toilet! 

Gets those plaque-like poop strains right out for a sparkly clean look that other cleaning products just can't get! 
Malboro used to pay doctors large amounts of money so they would recommend smoking as a healthy habit back in the 40's.

Coca Cola did the same. Recommending mothers would start their kids on a heavy sugary drink diet so they don't suffer from shaming during their teens.

Companies lie to the people all the time. They don't care about us as persons, we're just  filthy money generating animals.

People repeatedly falling for shit like this really makes their point hard to argue.

At least our government is not as immoral as our lying doctors.

Wait...
Because they are getting paid money? Did you not read the title?
Well if you are in fitness you would know any thing calorie dense can help you out.  That is if you are working out. 
The same way a handful of licensed physicians claimed that there's no 'definitive link' between cigarette smoking and lung cancer a full 50 years after said evidence was incontrovertible.

The same way a handful of 'scientists' can claim that astrophysics can easily be rewritten to include a 6,500 year old universe with a straight face.

The same way a handful of 'scientists' can claim there's 'no evidence' for man made climate change with a straight face.

We could make a list for days on this stuff. Money. Attention. Political influence. Sometimes a weird petty personal vendetta.
Did you miss the part where they were getting paid to say it?
Then plants will crave it
Out of the toilet!?
That's why they have vitaminwater.
What, more?  It's already got almost 4mg/oz of sodium.  That's plenty of electrolytes.
The thing is, there are lots of folks in the health industry who do this.  Look at any diet program, cleanse, or MLM scheme (Energy drinks, wraps, advocare etc) they all have "experts" working with who claim that their specific product is THE BEST EVER and you will lose a TON if you follow their program!  There's always a nutritionist or doctor out there willing to back something for a bit of extra cash.

Hey, times are tough for biology majors. You'll take any job you can get.
All natural Coca-Cola: Made with REAL sugar.  No artificial flavors or Gluten, and Non-GMO certified!
The beverage industry seems to get beat up a little more than other food sectors when they make "healthful" claims involving fruit on the box.  In the '90s, Kool-Aid and Capri Sun both received fines from the FDA for making their products appear more healthful than sodas, even though they basically contained the same amount of sugar, or more, and negligible nutrition.  

Just a couple SCOTUS sessions ago, Coca-Cola (who own Minute Maid) lost an advertising suit against POM because their Blueberry Pomegranate fruit punch contained like 2% Blueberry and Pomegranate, and 98% grape and apple juice.  
Just like adding "Organic" to any packaging.
which means it is not a **healthy** treat. Healthy treat means something you can consume regularly. The kind of coca-cola is called **sinfully** treat which tasted good but bad for your health. 
Once per decade sounds safe.
I mean it's unhealthy no matter what, but unhealthy doesn't mean it's killing you. Your body can easily handle certain amounts of unhealthy things. Your body is designed to handle these sorts of thing.
If coke still came with coke, it might help the obese lose weight...among other things. 
The fact that something can be consumed in minute quantities without immediate adverse health effects does not make it 'unhealthy'.  Small amounts of poison and inert materials can be consumed, in moderation, with little to no effect, but these are unhealthy to ingest in quantity.

Even if coke is not necessarily unhealthy, the lack of causing immediate adverse health effects does not render something healthy.  
The problem is twofold:

You can go to 7-11 and get a GALLON of soda from the soda fountain there. A gallon. That's not in the realm of a "treat" anymore, that's full on tasty torture for your body.

Even if you go the can route, buying a 24 pack of "treats" and having a couple a day completely negates the "treat" label. At that point it's a staple of your diet. It's promoted to the same standing as servings of vegetables or starches. 
Yeah, I usually have full sugar soda with my cheat meal once a week. Nothin wrong with a small amount.  
  
Problem is that Coke wants people to have these "healthy treats" every day.
As long as your standard diet is healthy, and you exercise regularly, a can a day isn't bad. Although I personally keep it to a can every 3-4 days (I value my teeth too much) I don't really see moderate consumption as being an absolute crisis that most make it out to be. 

Soda is a nice commodity. It's just that people choose to consume 2 liters. Ever compare a big gulp to one? The big ones are the exact same size as a 2 liter. People will finish those in a matter of hours. That's why we're suffering an obesity and health crisis. 
Yeah, exactly. There's nothing wrong with drinking a soda once in a while.
By a long mile.............
Yeah.

I mean, a coke is like 120 calories. I'm sure it's fine. 
A lot of athletes drink coke to help restore carbs.
Sugar is an excellent quick source of energy, so in his case it's likely more beneficial than not. 
Yes, however, different sugars are processed differently by your body. If I remember correctly, a tablespoon of HFCS will spike your insulin more than a tablespoon of regular fructose, or even cane sugar. It has to do with a sugar's glycemic index.
Did you know that you actually burn less than that? Treadmills will almost always include calories burnt on standby (while not necessarily doing anything).
Calories are burnt more efficiently while exercising muscles as that increases baseline consumption of calories on standby.
Liter of cola! 
It's almost surprising how oblivious some of the people in this thread are, advertising is everywhere.
It's his new magic serum.
In the Hartford Marathon they handed out small cups of flat coke at the 20 or 22 mile mark.  They also handed out fun sized candy bars.  Best butterfinger ever.
It does have its benefits. As a cyclist, having a Coke halfway through a 6-hour ride is a decent way to restore carbs and get some sugar down. I do restrict my soda drinking to riding days and only have one though.
Bananas will do the trick as well, and don't have carbonic acid, HFCS, tons of sodium, etc..
Flat coke sometimes diluted with some water was used as a sports drink decades before sports drinks were the marketing dream they are now.
> This is why you shouldn't believe things based on what experts say. Do your own research, use common sense.

Yes, because distrusting experts and "doing your own research" has done wonders for parents deciding whether or not to vaccinate...
love your name hate your opinion.....archer would drink a coke, then some gin and still run 20 miles while drinking rum and coke to save lana........i mean woodhouse is a smackhead and look how well he does...maybe
I've done a few triathlons, both helping and participating, and this is pretty legit. I don't think anyone is arguing that it's some miracle drink, but it certainly has its place for replenishing energy in a pinch.
True, but at restaurants a shake or malt also laughs at this as nothing
Such little sodium, heart healthy!
> Nothing screams healthy like 140 calories, 45 mg of sodium, and 39 g of carbs and sugar per 12 ounce serving.

Right there with you, brother.  I agree: we should avoid orange juice.


...


Oh, you were talking about Coke... yeah, best not drink a couple glasses of that a day either.
Except the caffeine sugar rush is going to make me want another one an hour later. Badly. So I avoid soft drinks. 
No you are wrong.  Foods are either healthy or unhealthy.  There is no such thing as a diet tailored to individual needs.  And if there is it still wouldn't be Coke because Coke is just sugar which causes autism.

When people ate paleo diet there was no war.  Then they started eating bread and suddenly 5000 years of human warfare.

Coincedence?
You'd be better off with chocolate milk or a protein shake however.  You get carbs, fat and protein that way... Coke just gives you sugar.
I realize this probably isn't what you meant, but the thought of mixing my whey with coke made me cringe.
[deleted]
Or just show a little resistance and have some self responsibility?
TLDR: I'm butthurt because I like smoking and people say it's bad.
The difference is when you drink a coke your not hurting anyone else. When you smoke a cigarette your blowing smoke which is harmful to other people. 
I drink maybe 2 bottles a day. It really doesn't affect you if you are burning off what you ingest.
A cup of chocolate milk would be better.
If people were able (and willing) to read, understand, and care about nutrition labels we would probably not be among the fattest countries in the world. 
Not since they're associated with the Patriots. People love to hate. 
Why?  Dude probably eats 5000 calories a day or more when he bulks.  Nothing wrong with getting your carbs from soda.

Especially simple carbs right after a workout.  Get a natural release of insulin.  Though I'm sure Jay Cutler injects insulin anyhow.

Bottom line though is soda is perfectly fine as a treat or even a source of carbohydrates as long as you aren't obese.
I look like the most unhealthy person in the world when I'm trying to bulk. 4-7 thousand calories a day is child's play for regular guys bulking, and a drop in the bucket for pro athletes.
Each 30 minute walk is about half a soda worth of calories.  If you cut out all soda and juice you'd lose way more weight than walking for 30 minutes.
It has the impact of adding 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar every other day to your intake, plus whatever people like to say about evil chemicals.
It has the same impact on your health that 40g of carbohydrates from any source has.  Which is to say, not much at all.

Soda and any other sugars are a problem if you are fat or diabetic, etc.  If you are healthy there is nothing wrong with it... its food.  

If you are trying to lose weight and are still being successful keep drinking soda.  If you aren't losing weight you need to cut more calories whether its the soda or something else.
Anything that contains salt has electrolytes. Gatorade is just flavored salt water.
where did you get a tooth? 
It's true. My teeth are totally fucked up from years of guzzling Coke and other sodas, not to mention a close call with diabetes and other health issues. I only drink water and fresh-squeezed fruit juice now. And beer. And tequila. But no salt!
Yeah.. but who takes a mouthful of coke and just lets their teeth sit in it overnight? It shouldn't even hit your teeth, but tastebuds. 

Overall It's just sugar water. I bet same thing will happen if you put a tooth in a glass of water with that flavor powder shit mixed in.
You're kidding, right?  There are so many ignorant people in the US that would readily believe crap like this if they thought it came from a trustworthy source.
Oh my god! You need booze. 

Hello, everybody!

And remember! If you're ever in doubt, just rub it on a piece of paper. If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain!

I swear to God I didn't look that up, and I think I got it verbatim. I don't think that's a good thing.
The "B" is for "bargain"!
Rub it on a piece of paper. If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain!
Honestly, drinking calories is one of the biggest changes you need if you really struggle to put on weight. Coca Cola isn't a healthy option to do this, but it would work.
I mean, isn't eating a cookie also unhealthy? But that doesnt mean theres no place for them in a measured, balanced diet. Coke can serve the same role I suppose is what they're trying to say and advertise to us. 
High in protein and electrolytes (salt)!
I brush mine with a bottle of Jack. 
Now we just need them to add electrolytes!
Also, it helps you to exercise harder... the more you drink the harder the exercises get over months of repeated daily use and the better off you are as their loyal customer!
yup.....The trick is to never stop drinking coke. It's like the medicine you can't stop taking or it will kill you.
So DayZ and The Long Dark have it right.

Or maybe soda companies are paying these developers to put soft drinks in their games showing you can survive off it! /Tinfoilhat intensifies.
My liquid intake consists solely of soda, were it not true I'd be dead.
Caffeine actually doesn't act as a diuretic in virtually all cases. It acts as a *bladder irritant*.
Many pro athletes specifically drink cola or soft drinks during training or even competition. I know that flat Coke is a popular drink in the peloton of major cycling stage races.
there's salt in coca cola, does that not dehydrate you?
Man I wish they had a label mandated by the government to tell me how much sugar in going to consume at a single glance. Maybe in a table with nutritional information. 

Maybe I should take advice from paid celebrity endorsers. 
Is it just me or is it sketchy that they don't "have data available" for almost the past decade?

A Mexican coke in a glass bottle and a joint is the world's  best hangover remedy.
So many personal trainers are lying scumbags who purposely lie to you to get you to sign a contract. I stood right next to my wife while this one scum bag told her to her face that she could cancel the contract  at anytime with no penalties if she ever changed her mind. Turned out he was completely lying. Had to make a dozen calls and threaten to do charge backs for fraud and threaten to file fraud complaints to get them to cancel the contract and refund our money.

My father had a similar experience  several  years ago, and the Better Business Bureau  website is absolutely littered with consumer complaints  over lying personal trainers and gyms. Never trust them to be honest. If you absolutely must have a personal trainer find someone who will let you pay for each session individually. Do not sign a contract with them.

I'm sure there are honest personal trainers out there, but the industry  needs way more oversight and gyms and personal trainers need to actually face stiff penalties for fraudulent business practices.

Yes, it's "part of a healthy diet." The unhealthy part of a healthy diet. 
> Orange Juice ... has even more sugar than coke

No it doesn't. I have two brands of OJ in my fridge, and they both list 22g of sugar in an 8oz serving. [Coke has 26g of sugar in 8oz](http://productnutrition.thecoca-colacompany.com).

That said, they do both have 26g of total carbs, because the OJ has 4g of non-sugar carbs. But even that still isn't more than Coke.

But your point that it's not exactly a health drink is entirely true!
On a cheat day maybe. Someone on a real diet can't fit the 100 empty calories from a can of soda into their diet. 
Do you mean fresh squeezed orange juice or the shit that comes in bottles and cartons?
All the names I wouldn't trust with my nutrition on that list.
I only drink unfiltered because...health?
>Some confuse the terms "dietitian" and "nutritionist," and this tends to be erroneous.[1] However in many countries and jurisdictions, the title "nutritionist" is not subject to professional regulation; any person may call themselves a nutrition expert even if they are wholly self-taught.[2] In most US states, parts of Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, the term nutritionist is not legally protected, whereas the title of dietitian can be used only by those who have met specified professional requirements.

Can you explain this joke?
I've found that if any diet or program highly recommends a product or food it is almost always biased or bullshit
It's because Dr. Bill Smith and Dr. Bill Smith on shift at Advocate Hospital talking to a patient are two different people. Most people just hear Dr. Bill and think he's obligated to speak 100% truth.

Dr. Bill doesn't mean shit unless he's being paid and under laws and regulation on shift. Dr. Bill could recommend you cleanse your sinuses with ammonia and bleach in a bar one night and it wouldn't mean shit.
The biggest hole with that "obesity it purely a self-control issue" argument is that the obesity problem is only a couple of decades old. So what the hell happened 20-30 years ago that 1 in 4 adults suddenly lost their self-control?
> Sugary drinks don't make people obese. People who have poor self control make themselves obese.

These products are designed to make people overeat, you don't see people becoming obese from overeating apples and brown rice. Eating too much of these types of food is the reason why people become obese.

And some researchers think that there might be more to it than just sudden collective failure in willpower:

> Available evidence in humans shows that sugar and sweetness can induce reward and craving that are comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs. Although this evidence is limited by the inherent difficulty of comparing different types of rewards and psychological experiences in humans, it is nevertheless supported by recent experimental research on sugar and sweet reward in laboratory rats. Overall, this research has revealed that sugar and sweet reward can not only substitute to addictive drugs, like cocaine, but can even be more rewarding and attractive. At the neurobiological level, the neural substrates of sugar and sweet reward appear to be more robust than those of cocaine (i.e., more resistant to functional failures), possibly reflecting past selective evolutionary pressures for seeking and taking foods high in sugar and calories.

There's more to it than people just being stupid, just as the obesity epidemic isn't just abut people not realizing that eating too much makes them fat.

Stephan Guyenet has an interesting talk on this, ["Why Do We Overeat? A Neurobiological Perspective"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp2p4TdLn_8&feature=player_detailpage#t=24m31s) (the food processing part starts at around 25 minutes in).

Here's a long but interesting read on food processing:

Yoni Freedhof's ["What's a Food Industry to Do?"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BdFkK-HufU&feature=player_embedded) also highlights some issues with advertising, especially towards children.

And, while more of a story, Adam Curtis' [The Century of the Self](https://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-TheCenturyOfTheSelf) has some interesting points on the birth and impact of advertising in general.
I agree with your tone, but not on most of the content.  In a country where so many children and under-educated people are obese, sugary drinks are the most important thing for us to eliminate.  

Also aspartame is one of the most heavily researched things in health, and is found to be safe.
Do you buy it when they advertise tobacco does not cause cancer? And it is purely the user’s fault since smoking 1-2 times a weeks isn’t bad? 	
Or you can drink lots of sugary drinks and exercise a shit ton.

Its not good for me, but my one remaining vice is red bull. Half a dozen cans a day.

I don't smoke, I barely drink, I eat a healthy diet.... And ride 200 miles a week.
That's the point. She might have even said that...before the editors got to the messages. I think it's called cherry picking.
Some of every group has their price. The rest of us aren't fucking savages.
>If you haven't sold out by your 30's, it's because no one is buying.

Can't remember where I heard it (more like which movie, but still...).
God how I wish they made Coke in the US with real sugar.
The worst part is you're right. People already go nuts about soda with "real" sugar like it's some kind of health elixir.   
  
Evidence: half the replies to your comment.
You know what's sad? That could actually work.

How do I know this?

I once saw an apple with a "Fat-Free!" sticker on it. That right there tells you exactly how stupid people are.
Coke contains as much sugar and carbohydrates as 2 medium sized apples.

Thing is, most people don't eat 24 apples in one day. Though I used to know a larger guy who drank a 12 pack of coke a day.
There's no such thing as "unhealthy" food, outside of literal poisons.

On the other hand, there are foods which should be taken in moderation compared with other groups.
I wouldn't say it's unhealthy when taken as an occasional treat. Things aren't either "healthy or unhealthy," they can be neutral as well.
It is entirely possible for someone to be able to improve their health by adding coke to what they consume.

Maybe their eating habits where shit to start with, or maybe it's a very small amount of people but it's possible. There are no unhealthy foods, only unhealthy lifestyles.
[deleted]
Fructose is the killer. And high fructose corn syrup happens to be high in fructose.
I guess that depends on where you live, in the UK we don't use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar. 
Yeah I couldn't find a consistent number online and the calorie counter on the treadmill is a joke, it reads up to 1k during the hour lol
There's a difference between advertising and paying off nutritionists to lie and say your product is something that it isn't 
For me, this advertising is unnerving because it reminds me of tobacco ads that proclaimed tobacco's health benefits. It's the fact that there is well-established scientific evidence that directly contradicts Coca-Cola's messages (one of which is "soda isn't linked to diabetes"). That's the problem, not just the advertising thing.

A cyclist who rides for 6 hours is one of the least likely people to need to worry about any diet related health concerns.  They are also likely represent less than 1% of coke drinkers worldwide.

It has benefits for a very small minority, for the vast majority who are already in a unhealthy state it's somewhere between "not that bad" and "you're poisoning your body".
Carbonic acid is the weak acid formed when CO2 is dissolved in water.  Its just about the most harmless component of the drink.

Im not saying that coke is healthy, but its not unhealthy because it has carbonic acid in it.  You can just as easily make bananas sound like theyre full of scary chemicals if you just called the aromatic components that give bananas their smell/flavor by their IUPAC names.
Coke has very little sodium... not to mention sodium isn't bad when you're exercising. 
I've never drank a soda unless it was a mixed drink. I usually drink straight.
The problem is though, people are more likely to look at a shake as a dessert/treat, but not Coke. There are too many people who will get half of their daily caloric intake from Coca-Cola and not realize it.
Yeah, you can't drink a shit-load of orange juice either. Or apple juice, or beer/alcohol, etc.
a 12oz coke only has 39mg of caffeine. If you get a rush from drinking that, then you must have never consumed a caffeinated drink before. For comparison, an 8oz coffee has 100mg.
For the second time, your knowledge illuminates my once dark world. The first time this happened was after I watched Zeitgeist.
> having a Coke after a workout along with an quick absorbing protein

He said to add a protein.  Not everyone wants to drink bro-tein shakes after every workout.  Sometimes I'd rather have soda and beef jerky.  The macros are almost identical.


No, government must fix it, we must force our views on everyone.

The cookie is still not optimal. "healthy" means beneficial, "not too harmfull" is not the same.
Can confirm. Whiskey contains alcohol, which kills bacteria. 
You mean like phosphoric acid?  Not only is phos acid an electrolyte, it creates *more* electrolytes by pulling the calcium out of your bones!  Kind of like a "buy one get one" with every can of Coke!
Water the grass with that shit. Cause. Electrolytes. 
You also get some water from food you eat. Anyway, are your lips in a constant state of being chapped? 
Have you considered... not that?
For a long while that was me too(sometimes 2 42oz a day). I added about  100oz of water a day, started cutting back to one can every few days or so, and I feel amazing...not sure how I survived off of diet coke and redbull for 7 years..im also surprised I'm not grotesquely overweight.
Why? Why don't you drink anything else?I used to drink soda a lot, but now that I'm active I can't stand it outside of a meal.
Drinking piss keeps you hydrated, doesn't mean you should drink piss to stay hydrated when you have other options available.

But it's called water!  I just assumed it was magic sweet water.  Why would I think to look at a label?!
Almost. In the one I saw, it was a ripped couple. Six-pack abs and everything. All sweaty from working out.

Or sucralose, or aspartame. None of which will dehydrate you (although they have some other obvious negatives).

We call it "vitamina C" 
One time I signed up for a gym membership and I told the sales rep that it MUST be a short term contract - I was in the area only for a summer internship as a student - and she told me it was cancelable at any time.  Fortunately, I was a law student, so I asked to see the contract before signing it, read the entire thing, and found the line that stated the contract was only cancelable if I moved more than 25 miles from the nearest gym location.  There was one gym within 25 miles after the internship ended, but being on an internship means I would be paid only 10 weeks out of a year - no way can I afford to keep up a 12 month contract.  I crossed that section out, had both of us sign it before I accepted the rest of the terms.

It is possible to negotiate almost any contract.  If you can't negotiate, or the person you're dealing with has no authority to bind the company, then you have to decide for yourself whether you can accept all the terms, otherwise you have no one to blame but yourself.  
It's a really shitty industry. I was interested in becoming a trainer when I got out of the Army, but the main way to get started is to get hired on at a gym like that, and it's a fucking bum deal. You get paid minimum wage (which in NYC, literally won't pay the rent), and the gym that offered me a gig wanted me to work 6 days a week with hours split so I still wouldn't get 40 hrs. The whole pay structure was based on commission and up-selling clients. It was about your sales ability, not your training ability. There are great, passionate trainers out there, but if they're working for a name-brand gym, there's no way for them to do what they actually care about and survive. If you're looking for a trainer, find an independent one, or a local, small gym with a good reputation. I bailed on the whole thing and have a desk job now. 
As with all salesman:

If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist.
They were just "negotiating" 
The best thing is that after people get fat and have diabeetus from drinking "healthy treats", Coke will turn around and say that no reasonable person can assume that coca cola is healthy, just like they did with vitamin water. 

Really though if you drink just a can a day and aren't a couch potato you should have no issues.
Meh, what really matters is how many calories they have.
You're dieting wrong if you can't.  Look into IIFYM.  Also see the twinkie diet.
Both.  Fruit is loaded with sugar.  Juice is basically the sweet part separated from the fiberous body.  While its good for you because it has a lot of vitamins, you're still drinking (albeit naturally occurring) sugar.  Moderation is key.  

If you don't believe me, look up the calories in a glass of fresh squeezed. 
Both are sugary drinks, so neither is good for you.  There is some vitamin C in there, but you can get that elsewhere without giving your body sugar shock.  Some of the stuff in bottles and cartons however has extra sugar, so it can be even worse than coke.   
Either. Go look on the nutritional info some time. Juice has more sugar than coke, and about the same amount of nutrients.

An orange is healthy. The juice of a dozen oranges is not.
Dr Pepper is unfiltered unicorn blood, obviously. 
The article used the term dietician though 
I mean for dieticians /nutritionists 
disagree

while sweet and enjoyable, saying soda is great is like saying Mc donalds/buger king other shit fast food etc.... is a quality burger.

I read somewhere that aspartame can negatively effect your glucose metabolism, potentially leading to diabetes later in life. Do you know if there is there any truth to this?
Are you Bloomberg's Reddit account?
Why can't they make aspartame not taste like dirty asshole? I can't stand diet unless I drink it for a solid month and am used to the taste.
If I asked you, for example, whether or not you'd say Coke is a "healthy, nutritious beverage", and offered you six billion dollars to do it, can you honestly say you wouldn't?

You have a price too.  It's just high enough that nobody's going to offer it.  

That's OK  You're human.  Just don't pretend you're above that.
As rewarding as it is to assume that nobody else is willing to stick to their principles either, it happens to be false.
Well you can get Pepsi with real sugar but I assume you did mean Coke and not just cola.  Regardless LOTS of sugar :-/
There's always Mexican Coke. Made with real sugar. I think I heard the formula is slightly different, but still much better than HFCS American Coke.
Throwback Mtn Dew has been out for a few months were I live, it is so satisfying.
Coca Cola Life. It comes with a green label  rather than red. 
People make such a big fuss about that shit but I swear it rates identical
I think they do now. There was a new "natural" Coke in the fridge at the gas station. Green label, claimed "real sugar" I think.
Get Kosher Coke while its available! It comes in two-liter varieties and has the yellow top. Available during Lent/Passover annually (because Kosher for Passover is so strict it doesn't allow HFCS).
They tried that "throwback" stuff awhile ago. I can't handle regular coke, candy, cake etc, and this shit made me gag. It was like drinking a flat out syrup.

Judging by that, everyone else is going to fucking love it. My affliction is in saturated fats (meat and cheese, I even only eat with milk.) My arteries are basically 90% plaque at this point. At least.
That's what really rankles me sometimes about marketing (and I'm a marketing major).  There's no factual error there, but it is completely irrelevant, and it just seems so sleazy to put a sticker like that on your apple, when you can guess people will look at that and think, "Well that brand says they're fat free and the other brands don't.  I wonder what they're hiding."
What is it I see on Reddit all the time? It's not the substance that makes the poison, it's the dosage. Kind of interesting to think about.
>neutral 

I agree, it's not healthy, but it's not unhealthy, it's just wasted empty calories, meaning there is no nutritional value. 

Everything in moderation, it's like a tipping scale. At certain servings, almost anything can become detrimental to your health. 
Fruit juice is pretty bad for you in excess, but it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. That syrup has unbound sugar molecules which are more quickly absorbed by the body than the unprocessed sugars in fruit. so you could argue (and there was a Princeton study that supports this) that drinking high quantities of HFCS is actually worse than drinking the sucrose + fructose found in fruit juices.
After my marathon I couldn't eat much or drink anything heavy.  It was water and a grilled cheese sandwich for at least 3 or 4 hours.

Then I had a beer and ALL THE FOOD
Unlikely from the team cars these days. Cola and similar drinks are heavily frowned upon by the team dieticians.

On the other hand these guys can need 9000 calorie a day intakes riding a grand tour so the odd one won't hurt.
Oh I agree. A couple of guys I work with drink at least 2 big gulps of Dr. Pepper a day and it makes me cringe every time I see them drinking it and I can't help but wonder how many kidney stones are in their future. I didn't say it was a great thing or good for everybody. There's a reason I usually limit my soda consumption to one a day, usually on training days.

That's all fine and dandy, but did you know that the main ingredient in Coke is dihydrogen monoxide? 


Nearly 100% of people who ingest it eventually die. 
This is the problem here. People drink 2-3 cans of coke a day.

depends what else you're eating.  

sugar alone isn't fattening really...... i mean you'll survive just fine, you won't be healthy, but your body will manage to function off the massive amounts of sugar, just not well.
I don't know if he is correct but this is what wiki says

This isn't anywhere near 'outright bullshit.'  Take the double down for instance.  Less calories than a Big Mac with double the protein.  Sure, KFC isn't the healthiest way to get your protein load but if you just finished a workout and were planning on getting fast food on the way home, KFC would be the absolute best choice.   The idea that you cannot have a six-pack of abs and eat KFC is in and of itself outright bullshit. 
My friend's grandfather was a bodybuilder and told me this was a common belief when he was young - that after a workout, you needed to "protein load" or you wouldn't build any muscle. So after a session they'd all go to KFC and eat a bucket of fried chicken each.
Oral rehydration salts comes with glucose because it enhances the absorption of water and electrolytes.

Oh yeah, tons of stuff is. The problem is there are kilotons of bullshit competing for space in peoples' heads.

A California burrito. All those greasy fries. Mmmh.
How does Pedialyte hydrate you more than, you know, water?

The perfect example is the Keep America Beautiful campaign, which could have gone two ways. 1) Blame the soft drink companies and keep a culture of littering, or 2) blame the "litterbugs" (newly invented word for that campaign) and make the behavior unacceptable. Which is going to have the lasting change? Number 2. Also, the soft drink companies (and many large consumer businesses) were responsible for the K.A.B.


So really we need to start excessive consumption shaming just like we shamed litterbugs.
It's my understanding that anything your body interprets as sugar can do this. So the danger with artificial sweeteners is when people don't understand how much their body still reacts as though it's sugar and treat it like it has 0 consequences of use.

Oh I know, it's only available in glass bottles though and is more expensive. I get it occasionally.
I've only seen this at 7-elevens and at $1.79 for a bottle! I wouldn't mind if it became a bit more main-stream. It does taste alright 
Rates identical isn't the same thing as tastes identical.  Some people just really prefer sugar to corn syrup, so they want that option.
Unless it's ricin. A pinpoint amount of that shit will kill you.
Have you actually read the Princeton study that you're basing this on?  You might want to (assuming you have journal access)...

Because it did some rather interesting things.  For starters, it was a tiny rat trial, not a large human one).  More importantly though, it lacked controls for certain tests and worst of all, at least one of the conclusions that it stated in its discussion section literally had no basis in the results -- as in they stated something that they did not observe.

The "HFCS is worse" thing has been talked about quite a bit, but sadly there isn't really any well-conducted research that supports this.

> Fruit juice is pretty bad for you in excess, but it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup

No, it contains equally-massive amounts of fructose.

Unless you're going to claim that fructose from corn is somehow worse than fructose from fruit, that complaint doesn't make a lot of sense.
As a non-runner the 12.something mile tough mudder with obstacles that test you mentally more than physically and a team was fantastic. I really enjoyed being taken to the mental and physical limit (had to carry a teammate for about 1/2 of it) but in a way that wasn't for myself... It was test yourself for others. It was a good feeling at the end when I couldn't get up Everest (a 10 or 12 foot halfpipe), someone had to pull me up because I had NOTHING at that point, I turn around on the top just to look back and I see someone looking up at me with the "if you don't help me I can't finish" look. Reached down, pulled him up. A look of thanks. Best feeling ever.

Is RC cola okay?
Damn, where I live it's 1.25 same price as a regular coke. 
This guy is correct!  The fuzzy feeling you get on your teeth and tongue is the excretion of bacteria!  The bacteria consume the 'leftovers' in your mouth and poop the acid that erodes your teeth!  

Good brushing eliminates their food source and keeps them from weakening your teeth!  Fight them bacterial bastards!
JARRITOS is healthier than Coca Cola. It's colored like fruits. 
When you cross out a section you have them sign the crossed out section.  Then you sign the contract.  Then you both keep a copy of the contract with the section that was crossed out.
I don't know why you'd add sugar to OJ. In the same way that apple juice with added sugar baffles me. They use apple juice to sweeten other drinks; you don't think it's sweet enough on its own?
Yes it does, thankfully I don't have to resort to drinking diet drinks. Coke Zero is....okay, better flavor than diet.

The problem is that people think they can drink 3x the amount of a diet soda and be okay. This is incorrect, as calories and sugars below a certain amount can be rounded down to zero per FDA regulations. 

"Since US federal regulations state that if a single serving contains less than 0.5 g of sugars it is allowable to express the amount of sugar in a serving as zero." So don't kid yourself thinking diet is the way to go. It is better than regular if you need to avoid it, but don't think you are sugar and calorie free by doing so.
^^^^I ^^^^prefer ^^^^RC.

I can't handle coke or pepsi. It's like 4/5ths sugar. I mine as well pound a spoon of sugar and chase it with water. With RC at least I can taste cola, and feel the carbon fizz more.
No restaurant would carry RC Cola over Pepsi or Coke.
Good brushing does that, but a fluoride toothpaste or rinse rebuilds the leached hydroxyapatite into fluorapatite, a more resilent mineral due to the strength of the fluorine bond. 

Also, water and saliva will do this by rebuilding into normal hydroxyapatite (via free hydroxide ions in water), assuming bacteria and acids don't leach too much of the structure away.
Not as fun as my plans of cloak and dagger, but that makes sense. Thanks!
.5g of sugar is still a tiny amount of sugar though. A regular Coke has 39g.

I also agree that Coke Zero is way better. It actually tastes like Coke, unlike Diet Coke.

Since Mt. Dew Throwback was so successful it seems that Coca-Cola is aping the format.

CIA: "Goddamnit you guys, you said that if we let you terrorize Central America you'd stop putting that shit in there!"
The guys in columbia just got the product confused. CC is still the worlds largest legal importer of Coca leaves.
Never go full-classic. 
Coke is literally balls deep in coke. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Company

>Coca-Cola includes as an ingredient a coca leaf extract prepared by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey.[2] The facility, which had been known as the Maywood Chemical Works, was purchased by Stepan in 1959.[3] The plant is the only commercial entity in the United States authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. Approximately 100 metric tons of dried coca leaf are imported each year. The cocaine-free leaves are sold to The Coca Cola Company, while the cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt, a pharmaceutical firm, for medicinal purposes.[4]

George Herbert Walker Bush, as head of the CIA, also became acting director of Eli Lilly Company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company), Eli Lilly Company, who gets its coke from Stepan - were all tied into the narc Contras and crack epidemics of the 80's. 

They smuggled in and sold coke as a means to promote the current war on drugs, the police state and to fund black ops terrorism operations around the world. 

A decent but short read if you have the time. Talks about the Bushes connections to the pharmaceutical and drug trade industries. Google some of the shit. It will absolutely blow your mind the amount of corruption the Bush family has been involved in.

	The Great National Temperance Beverage
Returning to their roots.  Kudos.
Are they putting the coke back in coke?
This is nothing new.  The new recipe still uses coca leaves.  The byproduct (cocain)  is then sent off to the Cia for redistribution into inner cities where it is mixed with baking soda and sold as crack cocaine. 
“Now I know what y'all are thinkin, you're thinkin, Barry and Levon, where did you get €50M? Don’t worry your pretty little head about it. It ain’t your concern. Now we could of bought €25M worth of cocaine, and that would have been a lot of cocaine, but we had to go all the way baby. All the way home. And get €50M, worth of cocaine. Aw yeah.”
this is surprising?
Wow that is one big cocaine!
I had the opportunity to drink coca tea from South America (like the Pope drank), and I liked it better than coffee. 
What year is it?
I'd like to take this opportunity to say how stupid the entire process of makng coca cola is. Coca leaves are a major flavoring agent in coca cola, but the naturally occuring alkaloids are illegal. So in order to make the soda, coca cola has the leaves shipped from South America **after** a "de-cocainifying" process which separates the cocaine from the leaves.

The now morally innocent leaves get shipped to the USA and other coca cola producing countries while the purified cocaine gets...well, let's all guess what *really* happens to all that purified cocaine.

There was an [article published in 1988 by the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html) how Coca Cola is still up to this day working with the DEA to important Cocaine Leaves, but they extract all the psychoactive chemicals from the leaves, and only use the "flavor" portion, so they can keep their unique flavor. 

I wouldn't doubt this article is related to that.  The secret recipe of the modern day coca cola flavor, depends on cocaine leaves to make it, they just extract all the psychoactive stuff from the leaves so people aren't actually ingesting the drug form.

Here is another [article](http://www.naturalnews.com/032658_Coca-Cola_cocaine.html).

Stepan Company extracts the cocaine in New Jersey. The purified cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt, a pharmaceutical company to be used in the medical field.
Charlie Sheen happens.
>> how stupid the entire process

Why is that stupid? - it gets them a unique flavor without ever having to handle a controlled substance.


It gets used for research purposes in the medical field primarily, but it also is used as a local anesthetic for patients that have bad reactions with other more common local anesthetics.

*Coke habits die hard.
Black Label?That stuff is the shit!Nice taste.
Thought it was that they sold spent coca leaves to Coca-Cola.
They used to use it in sunscreens, though I'm not sure if they still do.
nah.  They are related, though, as [alkaloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid#Naming).  I'm no expert but I try to figure out some of those name origins because it helps in identifying at least some similarities in drugs.

I think of -ine drugs as stimulants or vasodilators/constricters.  Like, Visine, for example, isn't really that great for your eyes.  They may take the redness out but it's because it's shrinking those veins in your eyes.  That's why potheads feel addicted to their eyedrops as much as the pot- because their eyedrops constantly dry out their eyes. Blowing smoke around their eyeballs doesn't help either.  Much better eye drops are just mineral oil or something that ends in -ose or maybe -ol.

Your -illin's are usually antibiotics.

Stuff like that.

I wish I could find an etymology reference for Greek/Latin etymology specifically for medicines because that would be handy to at least have a little idea in questioning if I have sensitivities to some things.
Actually, novocaine (procain) is the synthetic replacement for cocaine which works great as a local anesthetic *and* makes you feel good. So why don't dentists just use cocaine? Well, we can't have a medicinal drug that we can grow cheaply and freely in our own backyards, can we? No, we have to get all our medicine from Big Pharma labs. That way everything stays nice and expensive!
It helps the gamecocks go. Go cocks
Oh, he did. 
Pfft facts.  Who needs 'em.
[deleted]
It's stupid because it requires an involves a highly technical process to remove a substance that probably tastes good (like caffeine tastes good) and makes you feel good too. The amount in the leaves and resulting soda has practically no detrimental effects.
Isn't that funny that cocaine would be "safer" for sensitive patients when the synthetics cause problems?

I also know they cite excessive vasoconstriction as one reason why they don't use cocaine as a local - but at the same time, they'll add epinephrine to novacaine in order to reduce bleeding at the surgery site.
[deleted]
*Coke addicts die hard.
I didn't know about sunscreens, but those aloe gels and stuff have Lidocaine in them, I believe.
The -ine suffix isn't for stimulants, just alkaloids in general (morphine, cocaine, caffeine). -am and -pam is used for benzodiazepines  (diazepam, alprazolam). -mycin and -cillin are used for antibiotics. I think these are just general rules, there's probably exceptions. I'm not an expert.
[deleted]
> Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procaine)
>Well, we can't have a medicinal drug that we can grow cheaply and freely in our own backyards, can we?

Er... cocaine isn't like marijuana. Processing the coca leaves (and you have to have *a lot* of leaves) into cocaine is an actual process. It's not like growing a weed and drying its buds. You have to know how to do an a/b extraction, which I don't think most people know how to do. And even then, the coca plant is also extremely temperamental. You may be able to grow it in the south, if you can get enough altitude to mimic the Andes slopes. But you can't grow that shit in most people's backyards in this country.  Aside from that, you can chew the coca leaves, as they do in Bolivia, but that's not cocaine.
> *Actually, novocaine (procain) ... and makes you feel good.*

>...to be used in the medical field.

Absolutely, and besides, this excerpt clarifies any and all remaining questions anyone might have.
It's pretty amusing to consider that cocaine is Schedule II, while THC is Schedule I.

*Can we get a state to try a "legalization experiment" with Cocaine?  I think Florida would be much more fun if they did it.*
I don't know if it was in anything but if I remember correctly it was developed by Bayer and was supposed to be used in hospitals as a pain reliever similiar to how morphine is used today but you know, even more addictive.

*edit apparently Bayer brand Heroin was over the counter as I have had a couple of people correct my original statement.
heroin was originally used as cough syrup 
Heroin was actually the brand name given by Bayer. They lost the rights to the name after a lawsuit or something.
Heroin and morphine (also known back then as laudanum) were common cough suppressants. I bet they worked great. 
Cough medicines back in the day had lots of morphine. 
Technically it was a brand name version of morphene
They used to put heroin in cough medicine and baby medicine. To sooth pains, they also used heroin for morphine addicts, to cure them of their addiction. Sounds ridiculous, well they initially used morphine to alleviate the symptoms of opium withdrawal. 
Was Hermione in on it too?
*You got some coke?

Thanks guys. Never took chemistry.
Thanks!  I knew someone else out there thought about these things.  It reminds me of Lost 1st season when Jack went around gathering up their prescriptions to see what they could use to treat everyone.

Yeah.  I feel like us non-experts could come up with a cheatsheet that gives us a little idea.
I just learned stuff
That's a very narrow view of addiction. 

There is strong evidence that chemical and environmental factors play on addition. It is true that THC is not chemically addictive but the act of smoking/rolling/escapism essentially can be very addictive. 


The article is written in a way to vilify cocaine. That's expected because everyone has been told to assume cocaine is evil.

It's ridiculous because they imply that vasoconstriction is bad but then add epinephrine to many local anesthetics in order to promote vasoconstriction...it helps prevent bleeding at the incision site.
If it can be done is some mud hut country, a garage would do just fine. 
> *You may be able to grow it in the south, if you can get enough altitude to mimic the Andes slopes.*

You DO realize that 'South' - if you're speaking of the American South - and 'altitude' are mutually exclusive terms.

Note: "There's this one place in South Carolina where..." does not qualify as 'the South', unless one is trying to be pedantic.
Extracting *pure* cocaine might be difficult, but just getting the mass of alkaloids out, isn't. It's not any harder than extracting opium from poppies.

And you wouldn't need medical grade cocaine for the benefits. A bunch of coca tea is just about perfect as a general stimulant and analgesic. You'd never have to buy cold medicine ever again.
Ah, the dental hygienist tit press. One of the greater adolescent male moments for men everywhere.
Haha...wasn't Coca Cola in the news for funding rebel groups in South America? The same groups that grow coca? I haven't thought of this connection before, but it seems like a pretty deep rabbit hole.
That's too much Floridaman even for Florida.
It was actually supposed to be a non addictive substitute for morphine. Oops.
Heroin is still used as a painkiller called diamorphine.
Common in the US, less commonly elsewhere.
>In 1898, the Bayer pharmaceutical company began an aggressive marketing campaign to sell its commercial preparation of Heroin. That was the name they gave to their formulation of diacetylmorphine, or the product of boiling morphine for several hours. Heroin was heavily promoted as being non-addicting, and therefore an excellent treatment for morphine addiction. Bronchitis, tuberculosis and other cough-inducing illnesses were also treated with Heroin. In 1906, the American Medical Association approved Heroin for general use, and recommended that it be used in place of morphine.

http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/heroin-history-1900s.html

Heroin the everyday use non addictive formula. oh wait...
I thought it was sold over the counter for "tooth pains" or something like that, too.
> developed by Bayer and was supposed to be used in hospitals

that shit was sold over the counter
Laudanum was opium tincture. Opium dissolved in alcohol. Opium contains several opioids including morphine but not heroin (diacetylmorphine).
considering that the common cold actualy could kill you back then, they probably needed heroin to combat it.
And homemade silencers work by deafening those in the immediate vicinity!

I didn't say it couldn't be done, but the people in those "mud hut countries" who make the drugs actually know what they're doing. If you give the average idiot some gas and lye and tell them to do a chemical extraction and, oh, by the way, you gotta know how to not burn the product, they'd probably end up dead within half an hour of attempting to make the stuff. And, again, that's not getting to the point where coca itself is temperamental and simply won't grow here.

With pot, if you want to get really premium product, it helps to be a greenthumb. But for the most part, it's waiting for the plant to grow, making sure it doesn't die and then drying out the buds. If you got patience and can make a cup of coffee, you can likely grow weed.
>You DO realize that 'South' - if you're speaking of the American South - and 'altitude' are mutually exclusive terms.

No, because there are parts in the upper extremities of the south that have substantial attitude. We're not talking Colorado type altitude, but it's not flat, just at or below sea level around here.

>Note: "There's this one place in South Carolina where..." does not qualify as 'the South', unless one is trying to be pedantic.

If you aren't craving the drug, then why smoke it? Because you want to get high? It's almost like you're psychologically craving a high. and most people would call craving something an addiction once it reaches a certain level. There are more types of addiction than just physical addiction.
I was on it for 2 weeks after a broke my spine, pelvis, and both legs in an accident. I'd never done opiates before that. I can tell you, heroin is fucking amazing. I absolutely understand how people's entire lives get sucked into it. I was lucky enough to get off of opiates with relative ease. Never doing opiates again (unless i go into the ICU again, i guess).
Well, it's technically the synthetic form of heroine. It's not black tar. 
No it doesn't ya silly goose. It's pseudoephedrine which is sometimes used as a precursor for manufacturing methamphetamine. Didn't you watch Malcom in the Middle?

Broken bones and surgery got me fucking advil and they tried to do the same when I had kidney stones but I wouldn't stop screaming in pain 
In all honesty, all those things happen when you shoot dope. Nausea and puking are normal. 
Yes. They put me on oxycodone when i got out. Then codiene. Then just advil. So i had a good weening off.
Unfortunately nobody ever describes it right. You're warm. You don't want to be anywhere else or do anything else. Everything feels perfect. I got super nauseous and didn't mind one bit.

Finally look at the nutrition label and there's freaking 24g of sugar in there, calling it an alternative to anything is ridiculous.

who the hell still thinks coke is healthy?
Someone actually thinks soda is healthy?  WTF?  How?
Human nutrition is extremely debatable. If it was clear cut, there'd be a diet that was proven to make us healthy and live longer. I find cases like this absurd. 

After playing a sport it's beneficial to spike your insulin (through drinking soda) to promote recovery. 
Brown sugar water. Totally totally misleading 
whats next that smoking and working in a coalmine is unhealthy too ? :O
I have never once not believed that soft drinks are desserts disguised as beverages.
>Filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the lawsuit alleges that Big Soda used industry-funded reports and advertisements to shift blame for health troubles off its products and onto consumers’ exercise habits.

Coca Cola wasn't claiming their soda is healthy. They were claiming that various health problems linked to sugar-sweetened beverages weren't caused by their product but by not exercising enough. A lot of people do think that you can eat whatever you want is as high of quantity as you'd like as long as you burn it off. And that isn't necessarily true.
Wow. I guess people really just have no critical thinking skills and just HAVE to have their soda. EVERYTHING in a soda is bad for you, except the carbonated water. Even then, I still get gastric distress from that. Refined sugar, bad. Caramel coloring, bad. Phosphoric acid, yellow 5, high fructose corn syrup... And of course, if you have FIVE colas a day...there's that whole "in excess" thing.
Is healthfulness a word? My spell checker says no.  

Edited to add:

Apparently it is. It's a very ugly one at that.  

Edit 2: corrected spelling of healthfulness. Spell Checker still says no... 
everyone knows that, my problem with it is the addiction that you get 
Why would anyone believe what a marketing company says?
Why would anyone believe industry funded studies?
What is wrong with people?

Anyone dumb enough to actually believe that soda isn't unhealthy deserves whatever problems it causes them. This is natural selection at its finest.
I am fully aware of how unhealthy Coke is especially in excess. But goddammit, it's so addicting. 
A cunty researcher: (I'm paraphrasing) coca cola keeps kids hydrated after sports activities. Coke is mostly water.

Cunt go drown in coca cola.
"digestion of one calorie from almonds is not identical to the digestion of one calorie from sugar"

Of course not- they are different substances. But they both provide one (kilo)calorie of energy.
You lost me at "the healthfulness of its soda." 
People think soda is healthy?
But its ok for sugary fruit juices to do this.
I bought coke life because I love cane sugar coke and don't mind stevia.  I really enjoyed it and has less sugar than my gingerale.  I don't care if I have a little sugar anyway I'm having a fucking coke.
Get out there and exercise you fatties
I've never fallen prey to the Coca-Cola claims, but I have been taking Dr Pepper religiously at 10:00, 2:00, and 4:00 o'clock every day for years. At least I know *they're* not lying.   
i never feel bad for these people.

"COCA COLA MISLEAD ME. I THOUGHT THEIR SYRUP SUGAR WATER WAS HEALTHY"
I guess we'll be suing Hershey's soon too since their products are unhealthy, right?
If you are misled that soda is healthy for you...you are the one who should be sued.
Because YAHOO! blows.

Who the hell drinks *pop* because they thought it was healthy?
Was about to defend soda and then my hand fell off ...
So far as I've seen, everything is unhealthy for me. 

Except Kale and water.

And you know what, fuck Kale too.

I'm looking to wean myself off of so many.

In middle school to early high school I drank so much soda. I'm talking maybe a 6 pack of Pepsi or Mountain Dew a day.  By the time I stopped I weighed close to 250lb. I switched to water, diet soda and working out and lost close to 70lb within a few months.

Now years later, regular soda tastes like syrup to me. I drink water on occasion but I can't quit diet drinks. Outside of diet mt dew and Sprite Zero, I don't even like the taste anymore. I just drink them because my body craves it. If I don't, I get a bad headache. If I drink a lukewarm diet soda, my body feels jittery. I need to quit them.

Thinking about switching to black coffee in the mornings or at least something with a little bit of skim milk/tablespoon of creamer added to help wean me off of them while still giving me that caffeine and getting some water and those flavored crystal light packs for meals and trying to get used to Unsweet tea.

Either way I'm determined to do better this year. If anyone has any tips feel free to send them.
Don't forget that you age a lot faster.
Do you want a medal or something?
Coca-Cola also owns Vitamin Water, which was a blatant attempt to market a soft drink as a health drink.
Somewhat misleading. 

An hour of jogging burns one can of coke but the impact on your body lasts long after the exercise has finished.

The increase in muscle mass and the continued metabolic stimulus leads to a greater caloric burn over time than if you hadn't exercised at all.

So even after you're done exercising, your body is still burning more calories. 

The calories from healing the micro-damage to muscle tissue, the calories needed to refuel muscles after they've been drained, the calories needed to fuel that new muscle mass which has a higher energy demand than the fatty tissue you traded it in for.
A coke is 150 calories. Covering 1 mile on foot burns roughly around 100 calories, depending on weight. 

Is it even possible to jog 1.5 miles an hour? I can comfortably walk 3 miles in an hour. Do you think the average person is jogging at half walking speed? 

On the slowest end jogging for an hour is realistically about 400 calories, that's multiple sodas. If you're well trained and knocking out sub 8 minute miles you're probably looking at an hour run being worth 5 or so cokes 
Very misleading.

An hour of jogging does little to address the inflamatory cascade that follows the sugar entering the bloodstream.
A one hour jog burns way more than one coke unless you're going at a snail's pace. Even just a 5k run burns almost 300 if you do it at a decent pace. Still, not drinking the coke in the first place is easier. 
A can of Coke has 150 calories.  Generally you burn ~400 calories per hour jogging. 


After some coke you can jog for many hours.
How much is in A coke? Jesus I drink a can of Mountain Dew Game Fuel and that thing is 170 calories, but I'm usually burning like 300 calories in 20-30 minutes. 
Uh, no. An hour of jogging should at least burn 3-4 (or more depending on weight). At a moderate pace, I burn about 900-1000 calories per hour. A 20 oz coke has 240 calories.
> calling it an alternative to anything is ridiculous

Only if you operate exclusively in extremes.  Something with less sugar and fewer calories is a better alternative than full sugar.  Lots of people will refuse to drink 0-calorie soda but would be OK with one that has 90 calories instead of 150 or whatever.  Compromise.
[deleted]
Yeah I mean it's "vitamin" + "water" combined into one word; why would anyone think those two things would describe something good for you?
[deleted]
I'm a drinker of cola and I know it isn't healthy, but nothing hits that 'spot' like cola does.
[deleted]
Check out "uprooting the leading causes of death" on YouTube. Pretty interesting. 
> whats next that smoking and working in a coalmine is unhealthy too ?

It took a long time to convince the public that smoking was unhealthy and the industry spent billions convincing you that it wasn't.

So no, that's not next, that's last.

Presently there is a huge health problem caused by obesity that kills people and soft drinks play a major role.

So basically, yes it's true, you're a fucking moron.
We really need a tax on soft drinks so that people are healthier. Meanwhile in australia "look at these new bags of 330g chips! "Share" pack. Like that's going to happen. ;)
Come on...Be serious.  Those things are harmless and everyone knows it!  It's just common sense.
Well shit, maybe if I worked in a coal mine I wouldn't need Obamacare either, makes sense why coal country voted for Donald...
[deleted]
"Soft drinks" covers a large variety of calorie-free drinks.  I really wish people would specify instead of lumping them in with sugary drinks.
It's like when you are full of Heath bars I guess. 
Sounds as legitimate as misunderestimate.

Unhealthy food is food that is going bad, like a rotting pear. Unhealthful food is food that makes you fat and clogs your arteries like candy or deep fried Oreos.
Your spell-checker says no because you wrote "*heath*fulness."
Yup. Sugar addiction is real and Coca-Cola and other similar companies make billions off of it. If you have a sugar addicition, fight the cravings for one week and you will find it much easier to not be tempted. Worked for quite a few people I know, including myself.
Probably the same people who believe what the dairy and meat industry tell them that animal products are healthy
Even if you exercise and burn the extra calories, it's still contributing to your risk of getting diabetes.  It still triggers an insulin response from the body.  
because you are a Pepper too!
But you have to draw the line somewhere. I don't feel bad for them either.

Before you know it people will be doing all of their farming with gatorade if we don't regulate ads. 
If they also start a massive media campaign and pushed out shitty studies designed to confuse and mislead people about the nature of their product I'd like to think we would. 
And this is why our legal system is shit, because of the sheer low bar, and litigiousness of society. Everyone thinks everyone else has legal standing to sue over the most asinine things. 
What false claim is in their ad?
They don't. The say stuff the CEO said. Stuff that is true, but this group doesn't like. 

The group sues people for BS all the time.
> And you know what, fuck Kale too.

Lol, I like Kale. It goes so good in mushroom sauce and chicken thighs
nice straw man.

I haven't read a reasonable study claiming *everything* is unhealthy, and by pretending these studies exist you are shifting the blame away from yourself for bad your eating habits. It *is* possible to eat healthily. Just stay away from processed foods/drinks and meats unless you have to and you'll be fine.
How healthy is club soda compared to cola? I'm quitting fizzy drinks. Is tonic water okay?
Yet, to win the court case specific to vitamin water--if I recall correctly-- they pretty much argued no reasonable person wold mistake that for a health drink..
No, no its not. They do not try to market it as  soft drink
An hour of jogging burns multiple cokes unless you're jogging considerably slower than average walking speed.
You're going to need more Coca-Cola!
Does the exercise help the irreparable damage sugar does to teeth? 
If you're well trained and knocking out sub 8 min miles you sure as shit aren't drinking 5 cokes a day.
The problem is that the people who are jogging aren't likely to drink ~3-4 regular cokes a day. 

The person that does drinks a couple cokes a day had a McMuffin for breakfast, sat at a desk for 8 hours with a burger and fries for lunch, goes home has a prepared dinner and sits on the couch for 3-4 more hours.
Interesting fact: If you are walking at 1.5 MPH you burn more calories then walking at 3.5.  


Calling it a "cascade" makes it sound so refreshing.  
are there lots of scientists that accept this theory now? last time i checked there was one guy at UCSF med school who was championing this theory. but history has shown that we call one thing bad (fat, cholesterol, carbs, etc) and try to eliminated it only to find that in moderation it's actually okay. 
[deleted]
You should burn at least double that in an hour of jogging.
Its like 150 in a coke.

The issue happens to be the buckets of sugar they fill our food with
900-1000 calories per hour? So you're running a 6-7 min mile? Id say that's relatively in decent shape.

My max score in the army was 13:00 min for 2 miles.
They have a green can, call it "Coca Cola Life", and market it as a healthy alternative. I'm not blaming anyone for anything, I mean, no shit I could have looked. My point was that what's actually in there is counter to how they have health-washed the product.
[deleted]
I better start suing Redbull because I still don't have my wings.
They don't. Their labels are really clear on what is in them.
It doesn't seem like they were blatantly lying to consumers by trying to blame obesity on lack of exercise as opposed to consumption of soft drinks. 
> Congress said pizza is a vegetable. 

That's not really what happened. The actual bill which that claim was based on mentions pizza only once (on [page 33](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-01-13/pdf/2011-485.pdf)) and it's not regarding declaring it a vegetable. 

What congress DID do was state that for the purposes of nutrition law, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste can count as a single serving of "fruit or vegetables" (which are a single category under the law).  This would mean that a piece of pizza with 2 tablespoons of sauce would count as, among other things, a serving of fruit or vegetable. 

[Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/22/democratic-national-committee/republicans-pizza-vegetable-school-lunch/) goes into it in more detail, if you are interested. 
Now let's ask the Supreme Court.
Watched the first 10min and it became apparent that the guy is a total idiot. 

When he says "Eating one egg is worse than smoking 5 cigarettes", you know the guy is a fuckin moron that doesn't understand life. 


He rants on and on about high cholesterol, then he says 75% of heart attack victims had optimal levels of cholesterol. Soooooo... obviously that means that cholesterol levels are irrelevant to heart attacks. Therefore, your whole argument that cholesterol is "bad" is meaningless.

Also, talks about high-fat diets and animal products being bad... when there's tonnes of evidence that French diets (high fat butter and animal) have long life expectancies.
Just wait til they come for your weeds!
not from your continent but I'm under the impression that when you dear leader trump, repel your Obamacare system you will just get back to your insurances trying to avoid covering claims to make a buck, which I'm under the impression was the goal of the first Romney and later Obamacare to fix
Nothing in any of their marketing material does that. They claim that the CEO out of context comments count as marketing.

cspinet started going to shit after 1990. The often push for changes in foods without actual scientific data. Such as there trans fat issue.

They  are completly in the 'chemicals are bad for you' camp. They spread false information. 

They are slowly sliding into food babe territory and it's a damn shame.




Well of course they would, they don't give 2 fucks about anything but profit.  Why is everyone under the assumptions that mega corporations are going to be ethical?  
Wasn't there a big report recently about how the sugar industry has spent years reframing fat as the demon in our diet? It's resulted in soaring obesity rates in the US since the 80s during the fat-free revolution. Turns out a balanced diet including dietary fat (and not sugary fat-free replacements) is important to avoid unnecessary weight gain. 
Or forensicate. 
Well, fuck. Thanks. 
How'd you do it?
lol no doubt but steak and cheese are so delicious.
So get exercising and don't get fat
when did coca cola do that?
The [info is in here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-being-sued-misleading-211350342.html).
Kale is what my food eats
Club soda is way healthier.It's just carbonated water.  I don't drink soda, but I have unlimited access to seltzer and I love it.  Tonic water was also great, but then it also has a bunch of sugar. I don't drink it anymore.
[deleted]
They did indeed. It just shows how little they care.
Yes. I know. Re-read my post. The tried to market it as HEALTH drink.

Hence the lawsuit.
Wouldn't it also depend on many other factors such as age, gender, weight, height, skill level etc?
Depends on the size, it's a 20oz like 350 calories?
Or some Slurm! 
Sorry this is rubbish. I know people that drink sodas from morning till bedtime AND smoke and run 10-11 min 2 miles.
When I ran competitively('78-'79), I was drinking a least a six pack of coke a day. 

This is just a part of the myth that there are "unhealthy" and "healthy" foods.  Coke is just sugar water, like juice or almost anything else canned basically.

Athletes burn a shitload of calories and energy so they can eat a lot of foods that would be considered "unhealthy" to the average person with a sedentary lifestyle.  That's why you'll sometimes read articles like [this one](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/08/14/michael-phelps-12000-calorie-day-diet-not-for-everyone.html) about athletes who eat a ton of "unhealthy" foods everyday.  The only way athletes can build up their bodies is by eating an excess of calories which can come in many forms including pancakes, pizza, and even sodas.  If you are running a lot, you have to be eating a lot or you are not going to have energy or you're going to lose a ton of mass (great for people on a diet, bad for people who value their muscle mass).
So you've never met any soldiers 
I've seen marathoners do crazy things with their diets lol. There's all kinds of running products out there, gels, stingers, bars, that basically exists as super dense delivery methods for sugar. I wouldn't put it past some of them to just be casually pounding soda from time to time just because they can justify the sugar 
Exercise isn't that hard! Lots of people do it and still eat like shit lol 
Then posts on reddit about how what you eat doesn't matter and it's strictly calories in, calories out.
Thank you America, for our cascade of profits. Enjoy your cascade of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and trash.
google 'sugar the bitter truth'. the problem is this guy seems to have views outside the norm. i think calories in/calories out is still the prevailing wisdom. i'm not saying he's wrong, but he doesn't have a lot of company just yet.
No you won't. You would need to be running 13kph.


I run a mile in 9 minutes (or less) and I honestly don't think I'm running that fast.
My comfort zone is 4:45 to 5:00 per km, whatever that translates into for minutes per mile, and an hour run is around 900 calories for me. I think it would take considerable effort to only burn 150 per hour. 
I'm 210 lbs, 6'3" and aged 44 years and do triathlons casually - mid pack age grouper. I put out 900-1000 calories an hour for a workout run. ~6-8 mph or so depending on the workout schedule.  (5-6 min/km)

Don't forget that only ~10% of people in the army are infantry. Just about everybody else has a desk job or is in logistics or maintenance - so basically a factory job. It's the difference between a casual "just don't get fat" athlete and a college level competitive sport player.
Running 8.5 minute mile average at my weight (175 lbs, 6'5") is 960 calories in an hour
So you make wild assumption on color and marketing phrases that make no actual claims. Well done.
The info is on the can. At some point you need to take responsibility. The fact you were in a hurry doesn't matter.

It fucking says, right on the front of the label, REDUCED CALORIES.

Which it is.




It's not called Stevia Coke, it's called Coca-Cola Life and says "Sweetened with Natural Cane Sugar and Stevia" right on the front next to the mandatory Calorie Bubble that says 90 calories for a can.  While better than the Fructose sweetened regular stuff, it should still be used in moderation.
>  If something is called "stevia coke" it's reasonable to assume...

There is no such product.  

I have never heard of stevia coke, so I looked it up.  It looks like they tried an all stevia vitamin water, and the public hated it.
Labels are simply advertisements. Advertisements are never to be trusted at any time, anywhere, ever.

What you experienced is what's almost guaranteed to happen the instant you relax and don't think critically about statements made by companies trying to get you to spend money. That's capitalism. It's impossible to regulate it away.
On the front, is says reduced calories, not no calories.

Defending anything against lies perpetuated it the moral and ethical thing to do.

Why do you think lying is ok if it's against a large company?

Have you even seen a Coke a cola life label?


>You should be able to look at a label and have a pretty good idea of what's in it.

That's just silly. Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean it's the brand's fault. You expect the name ofa product to tell you all the ingredients? I know stevia coke has sugar in it, because I looked at the label at the grocery store.


I'm just a fan of common sense e.g read the nutrition label before drinking something.
There actually was [a lawsuit on this!](http://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2014/10/11/red_bull_wings_lawsuit/)
You never know...you could have a reasonable chance on collecting.  I can't recall their ads disclaiming consumers don't get actual wings after consumption or not....
TIL I eat a shit ton of vegetables!  go Congress!
Well they claim tomatoes are a vegetable because salsa isn't a fruit salad...or, something like that. Thanks, Port of NY. 
Do you have a link to that study?
He gathered that info from a study
Which weeds?
It will, and all of the families in 'coal country' who voted for Donald will lose their health insurance and go from poor to poor with giant medical debts.  (I should note that I'm not a Donald fan in case the sarcasm of my first post was lost)
No one is, OTOH, the clearly label what is in their sodas.
Will power and coffee. 
You can still get diabetes WITHOUT being fat because your body develops insulin resistance from taking in too much sugar.  If you exercise and burn that sugar off, you're still fucking up your body and how it deals with excess sugar in the bloodstream.
That's what the entire lawsuit is about. Did you even read the article?

>  the complaint contends that between 2010 and 2015 alone, Coca-Cola spent $120 million on research and other projects aimed at confusing consumers about, or denying, the science linking health risks to soda and other sugar drinks.
You go to yahoo to find a false claim in an ad?  You dont know what you wrote?
That stuff tastes terrible though.
Its not healthy nor taste good. People buy it cuz its cheap. It has to be refilled everyday, along with motherfucking powerade
I really don't think anyone could jog for an hour and burn less then 300 calories. Walk, maybe, but jog no.
I've seen coke served at drink stations at Triathlons.  
Ultramarathons are pretty much just an eating contest. Pb and J sandwiches, chips, m&ms, candy bars,  soda, you name it. 

Soda in particular is great at the late stages of a race since it's loaded with simple sugars and caffeine, a particularly good stimulant. 

Hell, I've had a slice of pizza and a beer halfway through a 50k trail race and fried chicken halfway through a 24 hr race. Many guys do worse than that. Gotta get calories from somewhere, might as well be tasty. 
Yes, however these running suppliments are made of complex sugars like starch and the likes found in pasta.   You can, in essence, make these from simple sugars like those found in coke, but the body is far more likely to burn the simple sugars for their energy rather than make energy stores as starches
Yeah - personally, I exercise a lot so that I can have a few less healthy things along the way. I bet I could drop 10 lbs by taking out **all** sweets, but that would be a boring life. 

There is some truth to the stereotype though. People who are serious about exercise are also serious about eating mostly healthy. If a person is going to track calories on workouts, you think they would know enough not to pound a few full fat sodas in a day.
I burn 300 calories in 25 minutes of jogging and I don't think I'm jogging that fast. How slow are you jogging?
That's not super fast. It's only just over 8 mph. Further, I weigh more than average (175 lbs, 6'5") so at a pace of 7 mph I burn 960 calories per hour.
so thats about  8.4-9 minute mile about 800 calories.
5 min km is like an 8 min mile 
Sir, we're going to need these numbers in Freedom Units. 
Should people read labels? Yes.  

Do they, in reality? No. Marketing teams make decisions which hinge on this assumption. And deceptive advertising lawsuits are regularly filed based on "minor" details such as this.
Man, you must have a ton of time to read labels up in your ivory tower.
[deleted]
The OP is referring to the nutrition label and or ingredient list, which are both required by the FDA to be on all food and drink products sold. They aren't talking about advertisement taglines.
this is why we can't have nice things.
Wait, was this just a canadian thing?:

https://youtu.be/8x9iYweART4?t=35
So get exercising
[removed]
Not with gin
[deleted]
Ha, here you go thinking that jogging can be sustained for a hour by normal people. 

Go jogging for an hour, most of which will be walking in recovery. 
Nope. They are snake oil sugar. Source - PhD in Toxicology.
No they aren't, things like Gu and Stingers are packed with sugar. They'll try to hype malodextrin as a complex carb to seem sciencey but in reality it's about as short they come with weak bonds and is functionally metabolized about the same as your basic sugars.

But the thing is it doesn't matter, because when you're an endurance athlete and you're ripping through energy the marginal difference between the two types ends up being moot. Sure, you want fiber and whatnot so your digestive system works, but as far as running fuel goes being picky isn't a big deal
They are in Freedom units, I think up you want  imperium Units*


*that's satire.
Not called stevia coke though. 
Well it's a good thing I replied to Ruumpa who is talking about the label then isn't it? The labels are simply ads. Designed entirely to appeal to you in some fashion and encourage you to purchase the product.

Also, the OP is not talking about the ingredients labels or lists. This is about ads. You apparently can't read.

> Filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the lawsuit alleges that Big Soda **used industry-funded reports and advertisements** to shift blame for health troubles off its products and onto consumers’ exercise habits. Basically, the industry posited, if people atoned for their sugar consumption by exercising more, they’d be healthier.


Can't see what you've got linked there while at work, but the American commercials usually had a spoken line of "Redbull.  It give you wings" at the end of their commercials.
Okay, this one is actually funny. Well done.
So you dont know the ad or what the false claim is?
Well that's a horse of a different color.
That's probably true
Then you aren't jogging for an hour.
If they are walking then that isn't "jogging for an hour" 

Jogging means jogging, people doing other activities wouldn't be included.  

>Go jogging for an hour, most of which will be walking in recovery

I can jog for an hour, I average about 35 to 40 miles a week running    
It then adds "Don't expect actual wings.  Redbull helps to temporarily restore mental alertness or wakefulness while experiencing fatigue or drowsiness".
What exactly is "the ad" you refer to?  I could explain what the article is about, but I have to believe that you can read it yourself, and you could read the headline.

As for the false claims, well, we are again getting into what the article is actually about, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist that you read it yourself.
god damn but reddit loves to argue.

suggest that jogging for an hour burns more calories than in a can of coke, and some jackass wants to argue that most people can't jog for an hour.

I swear there is no statement too obvious or factually rooted that someone won't say "well, actually..."
Holy crap, you're a freak of nature. I sit about 35 to 40 miles a week driving my car. 
Thats what I was asking, let me know the ad, and then let me know the false claim
Well actually 


Nah I'm kidding 
No, I'm really not, pretty below average runner, barely made varsity in high school.
There is no ad.  You're the only one that thinks there is.

Where did you get that idea?
This is reddit. You're a superstar athlete around here.
Isn’t Coca Cola life already this?

Derp 

> The beverage giant already uses the natural sweetener in its Coca-Cola Life drink. Unlike that product, which is made with stevia and sugar, the new one will rely solely on the sweetener derived from the stevia leaf.
It's going to be disgusting. Stevia tastes disgusting.
sugar god dammit. give us the mexican coke with real sugar for christ's sake.
Very yes. I fuckin' love stevia.
God, I love Breaking Bad. Thanks for the flashback, OP
Maybe a single cola can compete with Zevia. It’s the only stuff I buy. 
Since Breaking Bad, I never touch the stuff.....
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Life

2013
Hell yeah! I've been waiting for this for years.
Coke already tastes different from what it used to, what could go wrong.
Didn't they fucking learn the first time? 
Coca Cola life has had stevia for more than a year.
Why don't they try a sweetener that turns into cyanide... You know, like Pepsi uses. 
They already did this. The product is slowly petering out in Australia. No one likes it. It was coke life. They also have coke no sugar which is artificially sweetened. This is old news. 
I thought they did this already (the green cans?).
Ugh stevia is bitter as shit. I only use coke to clean grease stains on my driveway.
Stevia is fucking gross 
[deleted]
be interesting to see if it's any good, I already drink coke life over regular coke to try and cut the amount of sugar I have down and it's pretty close to regular coke.
Coke already does it. Pepsi already does it.

Neither are as good as regular sugar
Came for same!
My exact reason for opening the post.
It's not really a "cola" though. It's... something else. And it's icky.
So, yes. It's just a pretty bad headline.
There is a very good chance the carrier is what you are tasting. Inulin, Dextrose, or erythritol. Erythritol has a gross aftertaste for many, dextrose (glucose) doesn't taste that great either. Inulin fiber has no taste and is by far the best carrier, shown in quality tests of the sweetener. 
Actually, no it does not. At least not if you use it properly. As a Diabetic, Stevia has allowed me to satisfy my sweet tooth without risking life and limb.
I can immediately tell that something has Stevia. It's repulsive.
Agreed. It's just gross. 
It really does, especially when used to sweeten something to the level of Coke.  Just tossed some Stevia Cola yesterday.  I tried.  I really did.  It’s just awful.
Disgusting compared to high fructose corn syrup maybe. But compared to sugar it's okay. 
that's the only legit coca-cola
Some people actually want to live a long life.
Maybe you should read the article? 
  
They answer this in like the second paragraph. 
Read the article, coke life is stevia & sugar. This drink will only be stevia. 
They mentioned Life in literally the second sentence of the article and explained that actually also used real sugar, unlike this formulation. Do you have a reading disability?
Stevia is a plant. And they don’t put real sugar in anyway. HFCS.
Stevia is natural and much healthier than sugar.
Stevia is a plant.
I use tons of stevia and haven't noticed any side effects yet.
It has a bit of an after taste, imo, but it's not bad. I'm curious though why they usually only offer it in tiny cans or expensive glass bottles. 
you can say that about basically any diet soda. They're all taste different enough that people can dislike them.
Yeah, I use dried stevia leaves to sweeten my tea and I love it, but when I use the little sugar packets they have that bad after taste. 

Edit: But I also love broccoli and other things that people more receptive to bitterness hate. I forgot that was a thing.
Inulin fucks my stomach up. My wife too. It's an Express train to fart town next cramp city.
Sweet Leaf uses inulin I believe. I always buy sweet leaf.
Some stevia products I can't stand. I love raw stevia leaves, and the stuff they sell at stores in the green 1lb bag. There are 2 others they sell there which taste like absolute garbage, before and after. Trader Joe's has one which almost made me puke. The only thing I could chalk it up to was what you were indicating.
Thanks, 

I definitely find the aftertaste to be the worst. Will try find the insulin fibre ones. 
I bought a box of erythritol/stevia blend and it was disgusting. I know it's the stevia because it's known to taste disgusting to people who are receptive to its bitterness and aftertaste (I am). I now buy/love erythritol by itself; it tastes great to me even with its cooling effect. Plus it doesn't give me the runs like xylitol, so win-win. They'll never use 100% erythritol because it's too expensive and most people don't care anyway.
I bet this is a genetic thing, like coriander tasting like soap to some people.

I learned about stevia the day Vitamin Water started tasting like crap; I can taste the difference between orange juice with and without it. I've never tried the coke with it, but I imagine I wouldn't like it.
Well lets put it this way - any store bought drink with Stevia in it is horrendous. Maybe the drink companies use it wrong.
sugar better than corn syrup.
so even more disgusting?
If no one likes the focus on Stevia and it didn't work out when they tried to promote it that way, why make a drink that's totally sweetened with it?  You don't need to put disability comments in and be a dick about it. 
Fructose is a real sugar. 
not in the same quantity, can still cause cancer but the fatness from eating sugar also causes cancer... 
It most likely doesn't sell a lot so they put it in those for more profit.
I think this depends on region. I've yet to see a glass Life bottle and I've only seen cans a couple of times, plastic bottles are the norm here and it is usually prices the same (or cheaper in some shops).
Diet Dr Pepper laughs at your silliness!
Q: Does the same happen with other soluble fiber types?
>They'll never use 100% erythritol because it's too expensive and most people don't care anyway.

erythritol is the cheaper ingredient. There are several commercially available 100% erythritol sweeteners, *wholesome* is one, available at target, whole foods, amazon. 



Try the inulin fiber / stevia blend, it lacks the bitter aftertaste. This isn't my perception saying this, rather the data. 
Erythritol is extremely toxic to dogs.  Throwing that out there just in case.  I wish the packets had warnings on them, as it seems to not be a well known fact.

Edit: Meant xylitol.
Why would you drink orange juice that isn't pure? Or any fruit/berry/vegetable juice that has additives at all?
Yes, like using it with sugar/corn syrup.

Funnily enough, candy sweetened with stevia is actually really, really good.
No idea, never had life.
Captain pedantic ready for service.
Breathing oxygen causes cancer. You're talking about factor increases that are effectively nothing.
Mind listing some? I'm fine with metamuciln but that's insoluble.
Traditional table sugar is about 50% fructose and 50% glucose chemically speaking. HFCS is 55% fructose and 45% glucose. 

It's really not semantics, there really isn't a world of difference between these things, in practicality they're metabolized the same way. Economies like Mexico that are based on traditional sugar have much of the same problems, the issue isn't sucrose vs HFCS, the issue is just overeating either/or.
obesity causes cancer (the reference), per oxygen that is why you have superoxide dismutase

*to complete the reference* Stevia is a carcinogen. It was approved for consumption because the level consumed is so low as to not make a difference and this was demonstrated with numerous animal studies
Found a good list [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/whats-the-best-fiber-supplement)

* psyllium (might make you gassy... metamucil)

* Methylcellulose (citrucel)

* dextrin (benefiber) 



Fair enough, but would you agree with OP that real sugar, either hfcs or table sugar, is healthier than stevia?
Stevia is not a carcinogen by any widely accepted scientific research. In fact some trials suggested the forms used as additives had marginally anti-carcinogenic effects. You're bullshitting.
This is why the reference was removed from wikipedia, the general population doesn't understand it. I stated as clearly as I could that the amount consumed as a sweetener was so low as to not make a difference. Higher quantities do cause cancer. But you don't consume the higher quantity like I mentioned. 

Your take, a very incorrect one was 

> Stevia is not a carcinogen by any widely accepted scientific research.

Read the FDA statement on its approval. You can find it on the fda.gov page. 
>The plant commonly known as Stevia contains steviol glycosides, which are used as sweeteners. If food ingredients, such as sweeteners, are generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”), they do not require FDA approval as a food additive. Based on its review of information and data submitted by industry in GRAS notices submitted to FDA, FDA has not questioned the GRAS status of certain high-purity steviol glycosides for use in food. These high-purity steviol glycosides may be lawfully marketed and added to food products sold in the United States. 

That's the FDA position. No mention of carcinogenic properties, none of the additive versions used in food are considered a carcinogen by any competent body.

Your argument is akin to putting an asterisk on drinking water because one could drown, it's retarded.
So why did the FDA pull stevia in 1991? The exact reason I stated. Why was it re-approved? The exact reason I stated. What is their current position? Exactly what I stated. 
Because of poorly done early studies that were overwhelmingly refuted in deeper follow up studies. 

It's always bizarre to me when people cite decades outdated research to try to refute current research. They're basically screaming that they don't understand how science works. Pretty hilariously retarded, wouldn't you say?

What exactly is so surprising ? People don't want corporations to be democratically run. 

People admire billionaires. Just watch the Elon Musk/Warren Buffet reddit circlejerk.  People think billionaires are some kind of incredibly good men. Most billionaires are highly manipulative psychopaths. 

Well, here is the result.
Wasn't one of their slogans in the 80s "Have a Coke and an RPG"?
wow Coca Cola can't catch a break, their execs had 50 million euros worth of cocaine delivered to them in France yesterday
Corporate imperialism. Fun stuff.
2017 is the year we find out Coca Cola never stopped putting cocaine in their drinks, and has been funding Colombian drug lords so they could get a steady supply.
Corporations are already richer than entire nations. 

Mussolini... Hitler... Coca Cola... how long until corporations start showing up on other lists?
Remember this the next time you see a gay couple drinking Coke on your TV screen. The people who run these companies don't give a damn about you, what they're feeding you, or what the trend of the day is, be it gay marriage or putting black people in a noose. All they care about is making sure their production costs are low, their sales are high, and that anyone who stands in their way gets bulldozed whether it be by funding AUC or ISIS. Enjoy your Coca Cola.
Pepsi has done no such terrible thing however.

BUY NEW CRYSTAL PEPSI TODAY.

...Okay so when do I get the check?
Christ, more than 50 companies were funding this group? And Coca Cola among them.... My head is spinning. I didn't know that Corporations were that out of control. I knew they didn't pay taxes, and they bribe our politicians, and they write our laws, but now... they also get to peddle drugs and fund extremist groups that are um... killing people.

I expect a SEVERE penalty!!! - Like, you know, one day worth or profits. Kind of like when big oil pays penalties and the cost of the penalty is so low that they will commit the same crimes again because it's actually more profitable to commit the crime than conduct business according to environmental law, etc.
If I were a Pepsi marketing executive I would be all over this. 

The fucking headlines write themselves "Coke sells Coke" 
so does this mean they will be shut down? because anything less would be unacceptable. 
Wait, they're actually going after complicit geopolitical corruption now?

Am I in bizarro world?
If we are starting to charge the backers of brutal juntas and terrorist in south America, then why is Kissinger still walking around free?
>Multinational beverage producer Coca Cola is one of more than 50 companies that will be charged with financing the now-defunct Colombian paramilitary AUC group, a designated terrorist organization.

But why?  Coca-Cola makes billions annually.  What motive do they have?
terrible that a copr gets in trouble when the US government has done the same thing.  Wonder if they can use that in their defense

"The United States of America has at various times in recent history provided support to terrorist and paramilitary organizations across the world. It has also provided assistance to numerous authoritarian regimes that have used state terrorism as a tool of repression.[1][2]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism
I'd like them to do that with PLO next.
Yeah, that site looks reputable.
This was 10-20 years ago. Is there not a statute of limitations?
I'm sure they have lots of evidence
Still better than Pepsi.
Typical, people always want to go after deep-pocketed American corporations rather than seeking justice from those who actually committed the wrongful acts in their country.  These acts were committed by Colombians against Colombians, and if a price is to be paid, it should be paid by Colombians.
yeah, i've always been really curious how the people who actually DID these things totally manage to hide behind the curtain and get away cleaner than clean.
We need to innovate "corporate person prison." Maybe the board can take turns spending a month in a non-white collar crime cell block.
Oh but you fail to see that corporations are people too... Except when accountability comes in the play then they're actually untouchable.
[deleted]
And yet we lose our shit if someone doesn't stand up for the anthem...
Just waiting for the day the courts rule that people are corporations, too. I'll finally stopped getting sodomized by the system and instead receive blowjobs.
Instead of fines the government should just seize an equivalent worth of assets and liquidate them. Some may call that extortion, but hey it's Coca-Cola and they helped fund a terrorist organization so fuck'em.
"corporations are people too, my friends"

so that the people running them will never ever be charged.  The rich dont go to jail for supporting terrorists silly!  They just pay fines then go to sleep on a slightly smaller pile of money that night.

Meanwhile you have the NSA spying on all of us looking for any sort of terrorist connection, destroying our civil liberties.

Rules for thee but not for me!
It's not funny. It's globalism. With TPP all but said and done, this is our future. I used to think the premise of Frank Miller's Martha Washington stories were outrageous satire. It's now reality. 

Nike will arm North Korea with swoop logo'ed AKs. The Red Cross will be swapped for the Starbucks mermaid on war zone ambulances. Baltimore riot police will have the WB logo on their shields. 

10 years max and this will be the norm. 
The government wants money, not people it has to pay to imprison.
don't forget all the merc private armies for global companies running around Africa all because they want to control some land with precious natural resources.  
Which has lead to the demise of the Gorillas in the Congo.
Don't forget BP's "we're sorry".
I had an intro to econ professor say something along the lines of: 

"I don't teach ethics. I teach business. 'Business ethics' isn't a thing." 

The more time goes on, the more I notice how true that statement is. Money is the moral in capitalism. That's it. While I do believe that many high class people actually are honest, no one is questioning those who are lying.
I wonder if it would be legal for the government to fine them, but opt to seize an equivalent amount of assets from the company. Money can be made up again at the expense of everyone except those at the top. Literally taking away physical property or something owned by the company might be a little more harmful which is what they deserve.
And the opinions of half the citizens of western countries? *More* privatisation!!!
Ever heard of a pinto? For anyone who's never heard, google 'ford pinto gas tank'
It is almost like capitalism is a scourge on modern societies, despite bringing them into a healthy existence. Time to push for more socialism fear mongering, by highlighting tiny dictatorships who couldn't afford to run a successful socialism.
You forgot this one...
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster
And yet all of those problems pale in comparison to the destruction caused by centralized democratic governments. 
No, that was the Reagan administration.
Well they meant for it to reach their head office rooms where it would have been safely hidden in their noses
Whatever.  Pepsi is better anyway.
AKA imperialism.  Remember that the original imperial powers were corporations (i.e. East India Company in India in the 18th century)
Coca cola through a sister company called the stepan group is the only company in the US that has a lisense to import coca leaves from peru. They use chemicals from the leaves in the drink but its not really cocaine.
[deleted]
No. Probably no one even goes to jail. Maybe one guy.
The 10 year statute of limitations can be extended if there are circumstances that prevented them from filing earlier. 

>The judge said the plaintiffs had alleged enough facts to possibly support tolling of the TVPA, particularly that volatile political and social conditions in Colombia prevented them from filing suit until at least 2007. http://www.law360.com/articles/802779/chiquita-can-t-ditch-colombia-paramilitary-torture-claims
Corporate sponsorship probably helped the terrorists quite a bit.
You must be high or had a lobotomy to spew that bullshit.
That, my friend, is why corporations were created in the first place, to take the fall. 
Are the people who funded the group still at the company?
The reality is the personal assets these board members accumulated while committing crimes should be forfeited. 
I suggest glass dildos be standard issue. 
I like it.
You want to investigate and try every single Coca Cola employee?
We don't.
Some vets took offense.
The media blew it up.
I think it was a poorly executed statement, but am all for the right to do so.
Our ability to be heard means a lot of people speak on issues that maybe should leave that to those more capable, and intelligent.
Oh gorillas you say?
Or Transocean the US-American company that actually caused the oil spill.
Or GM ignition switch?
>Time to push for more socialism fear mongering, by highlighting tiny dictatorships who couldn't afford to run a successful socialism.

What's your complaint about Stalin or Chairman Mao? They weren't hindered by being tiny, and managed to kill tens of millions. 
[Obligatory](https://youtu.be/lFV1uT-ihDo)
this is what you support when you stand for the national anthem.
50 million worth??  kickbacks
Any love for RC? ...hello? ....anyone?
Try serving Pepsi as a mixer at a bar.
Only to people with no taste buds though. ;)
Good point, the American colonies were given to companies as well. Big land grants to... companies.
that is absolutely mind blowing to me. a fine for what i a borderline war crime. wow
Specifically a fine that amounts to something like .000002% of their annual profits, and is so minuscule that it has zero deterrence effect.
But that says clearly they were able to file suit in 2007. So the statute of limitations does exist, is 10 years, they were given a 2007 start date? 
Nope, sober.  And no lobotomy, I'm actually pretty clever.  I just don't blame my country for all the world's ills.
Noam Chomsky has some great lectures about this. 

In an allegorical way it would be like having a nickname and doing blatantly illegal acts and making massive amounts of cash, while using your nickname, up until you finally get caught. 

But you also have your whole crew operating using that exact same nickname. So when you finally get caught you're like "hey, I had no personal knowledge of what went on.. I have 189 people using my nickname while conducting business. It's impossible to find who's responsible."

Then you simply pay a fine of about 2% of your profits. Then you and your 189 person crew change your nickname and carry on with illegal business as usual. Get caught.. and repeat. 
That's exactly what the "corporate veil" is there to prevent, personal liability for the corporation.

In extreme cases it breaks down, but by and large it's a good thing.  Would you risk starting a business if, when some employee was dumb enough to mix bleach and alkaline cleaners and a customer gets hurt, you could go to jail or lose your house?


Not sure why you're being downvoted. Comment is lucid and to the point
...

Sure. Why not.
Wait what are talking about?
Or Toyota accelerators.
Why do people always forget the authoritarian/non authoritarian axis of the political spectrum? Comparing maoism and stalinism to other forms of socialism is a repeatedly debunked strawman. 

Also the US killed/tortured/enslaved millions of people for the sake of capitalist progress, so dont pretend that you are on some sort of moral highground.
They didn't kill tens of millions because of socialism....
Care to elaborate?
Yeah, Pepsi is way better as a mixer. I will go out of my way to go to a bar that serves Pepsi than one that is Coke only.
I guess so. 
The companies literally supported these groups. It's not just colombians' responsibility.
You're not as clever as you think. Deep-pocketed American corporations are frequently in the wrong. They consistently choose profits over morals. Much easier to live wifh yourself when everyone else sharss some responsibility for their morally reprehensible desicions.
r/iamverysmart
Bull to that anti-establishment shit.  It's the CocaCola distributor not Coca Cola and the Paramilitary was to prevent their bottling plants from being bombed and their employees from being kidnapped.  Maybe you should go hang with the FARC and see what great guys they all are as they went 25 years through cities bombing, killing and running drugs.  Perhaps the paramilitaries abused their local power - that is what happens in third world countries when there is no central authority.  

As usual, the local suffer no matter who is in charge.
Because modern society isn't pro rape?
Because the guy stocking the vending machines at the high school probably didn't have much to do with funding a Colombian paramilitary group.
I replied to the wrong thread.
My bad
Have you not learned about Great Leap   Forward in school yet, or is that not covered until you get to High School? 
i mean if sitting down is disrespect for all of the nation then standing must mean support for all of the nation. right?
Well I will laugh my ass off when the case ends up the same way that Ecuador's suit against Chevron worked out.
Usually I'm the one doing what you just did.  But unless you claim an IQ of 150, claim to read Nietzsche,  and/or vomit a thesaurus, you don't really belong there.


That guy probably had to sell coke on the side to supplement income.
*Then he has nothing to be afraid of.*
The Great Leap Forward was destroyed by communistic ideology and lack of a solid existing economy, not socialism. They tried to quickly move a rural farm country into an industrialized country. They did this with terrible communistic ideology like collectivization of goods, forced labor,  and mass killings.

Now take a marginally successful capitalistic economy, who already has lots of socialistic programs and slowly transition it into more and more of a socialism, preferably with a fair democratic government, and your chances for success seem much greater.
Saying the great leap forward was caused by socialism is like saying that Charlie Chaplin caused the Holocaust.
Coke a cola isn't a nation, it's an incredibly large company.
Well you're certainly entitled to being an ass if it suits you lol.
What the hell's wrong with reading Nietzsche?

I'd take a Nietzsche reader over someone who responds to being called an idiot with "I'm actually pretty clever" any day.

The article suggests it could be tied to immigrants in Germany. (That may be a stretch...)
>The rumour is that some poor immigrants could have made that long journey in the lorry and that in their desperation were forced to use the cans instead of a toilet.

"The rumour is that some poor immigrants could have made that long journey in the lorry and that in their desperation were forced to use the cans instead of a toilet."

Kind of sick that they try to pin this on "immigrants".

Saying simple that that is the "rumour".  WTF?
Someone's gonna get shitcanned. 
That's wot I think of yer brown sugar water, ya wanker!
The secret formula for Coke is finally revealed!   :D 
The probe will reach Venus in early 2025.
Pretty sure I saw TIL the other day about a legal case where mountain dew prooved it is acidic enough to dissolve a mouse.

Wonder if they can use that defense here.
I read this as "Pope launched.."
A "probe" may have been how it got there in the first place... if you know what I mean.
Now what are they gonna do about the human waste that works at the factor?

Thank you, I'll be here all week.
I wonder if this will end the same way as the rat in the mountain dew can, where coke proves that human waste would actually be broken down by the coke in the can so this isn't possible. 
I read this as Pope launched... I was like damm that guy's involved with everything.
And people made fun of the Nigerians.
Pepsi's new anti-Coke campaign slides into high gear.
if you read the article, the shit was found in a bunch of empty tin cans before being filled. the article says illegal immigrants are suspected of shitting in them on their journey
False alarm. Turns out it was Coke Zero. 
Can someone say....shit canned? 😂
Dummy's didn't know dna is in pooh 
All I hear is EDI saying "probe launched" "probe away"
> "But rather than condemn anyone who might have found themselves in this situation, I think it's far more important that we help anyone who is that desperate and make sure they're safe."

This is something we all should sometimes think about.
Southern papers are the opposite to English. 
They take ownership of even the bad things - as opposed to the English claiming good things and people unrelated to them. 
What was Trump doing in Ireland?
Well I mean you can't just call them the Irish anymore.
Piggybacking your comment to say **FUCK** Independent.ie's website.  Completely bombards you with advertisements and embedded surveys.  It even launched near the bottom of the page so all I saw were "sponsored content" ads and had to scroll up to get to the survey which I had to close in order to read the article lol.
It has to be in some way morally irresponsible to put this imagery into peoples' heads.

They don't have those terrible "regulations" in China. 

The ones that The Donald plans to get rid of here in the US because Republicans say that regulations obstruct business, that businesses should be free to put sheet in coke.
Have you tried that Mexican coke? Delicious. Much better than the shit coke they have to drink in Ireland. 
Ah Donald, 'tis yourself ;-)
They figure "immigrants" are the trending "popular" scapegoats.
> "The rumour is that some poor immigrants could have made that long journey in the lorry and that in their desperation were forced to use the cans instead of a toilet.

> "It's really shocking - and beyond the shock of finding something pretty disgusting in the cans is the thought there could have been poor people in that situation. And if they did make that journey, where are they now?"

I don't understand the sympathy for these migrants that illegally sneaked themselves onboard a truck and, instead of simply pissing or shitting in the corner of the truck (or having the foresight to bring some bags or containers with them), intentionally befouled the coke cans that people would eventually be drinking out of.

Speaks to how uncivilized many of the migrants and refugees over there are.  People are naive to think they're going to actually integrate and assimilate into Western European society.  It's just going to be more and more self-segregation in isolated ghettos like you see throughout Europe.

Also, this kind of stuff makes me thankful that our illegal immigrants here in the United States are actually civilized and beneficial to our country.  Don't think Republicans and alt-righters appreciate or understand the difference.
Always a party with Slurm.
If it wasn't brown before, it definitely is now.

> I don't understand the sympathy for these migrants that illegally sneaked themselves onboard a truck and, instead of simply pissing or shitting in the corner of the truck (or having the foresight to bring some bags or containers with them), intentionally befouled the coke cans that people would eventually be drinking out of

Or, maybe that is not what happened.

I know, just joking. 
I think any refugees from wartorn countries like Syria and Libya should be given food/water, shelter, hygiene/sanitation/health necessities, clothes, and all that should be provided to them as long as their home country is an unsafe place for them to return to.

However, I think all that stuff should be provided to them in the first stable country they reach that can provide asylum to them.

I believe that once they skip out on that protection and begin traveling across the continent to reach the country they prefer to settle in permanently they become economic migrants and their purpose is not survival and their situation is not desperate.

This may be somewhat of a cold position to take but I think it's important these people be kept in a place so they can be provided for and actually repatriate once their countries are stable so their countries can rebuild and not suffer for decades more due to population loss effects: brain drain, no labor force, no population growth, etc.

Also, evidence shows that there's something about Western Europe and the culture of these migrants that makes it difficult for them to assimilate into European society.  I think part of that is that Middle Easterners that immigrate to America are more often the most educated and wealthy from their countries whereas Europe is getting lower educated, less civilized, less wealthy migrants.  I think these people (and Europe) would be better off if they stayed in their countries and helped rebuild their countries over the next few generations.
Anyone kidding themselves this isn't smartly marketed kool aid is delusional.
Oh man, in the comments: 

>don't worry, they sell that too. In the US it is cheaper to drink beer than to buy bottled water.

I really have to wonder if these people have ever been shopping in their lives. Who honestly believes this? A refill gallon of water is like 25 cents, and if you're buying gallons they're around a dollar. 24 packs range from 1.99 to 5.99. Tap water is pretty much free (you pay your water bill and it covers it) and it's perfectly drinkable in most areas. I don't know what the "in the US" thing is supposed to mean... I don't think most developed countries have the same fetish for paying for bottles of water when water from the tap is perfectly drinkable. 

I wonder where this person lives that beer is even a semi-comparable price. 
How do people still drink this crap it's like watered down fruit juice
It tastes like weak Kool-Aid and a Flinstone Vitamin mixed in.
Next time we adjust the label it should look like this;

Kool-Aid Packet

Two Cups of Sugar

Double Water

Single Flintstone Vitamin Tablet
Can they add "Does fuck all for you?"

Buy a banana and drink a glass of water. You'll still have $1 left over.
If the product is from Coca Cola you can be sure that there is a greater than 80% likelihood that it contains either lots of sweetener and/or caffeine. These companies like Coca Cola know full well what effect too much sugar has on people and they exploit it for financial gain, not unlike big tobacco did/does.
"Coca-Cola argued in its defense that no reasonable person could be misled into thinking Vitaminwater was a "healthy drink""

Coke admitted it's just sugared water.
Read the label. It's not difficult. There are three macronutrients: fats, proteins, carbohydrates. Under carbohydrates, you will find the subcategory, sugar. Then, it will tell you how many grams of sugar are in the item. 

It's simple and straightforward. If you can't be bothered to do that, there's something wrong with you. 
How can anyone drink that shit and *not* know that it's full of sugar?  

It tastes exactly like sugar-water.

I hope I was never that clueless.
I was surprised to see the amount of people who don't read the nutrition facts on the bottle. I asked my friend why he drank so much vitamin water and he said it was better than normal water. I looked on the back expecting vitamins and water, but all I saw was like 5% vitamins and a ton of sugar. 
Did people not realize this?
Vitamin water? from coke's company? LOL... Stick to water, that's healthier.
If you're too dumb to read the label I have no sympathy for you. Hopefully the extra sugar makes them fat enough to be unbangable so Darwinism can lead to future generations that are smart enough to read the fucking nutrition label. 
HOLY SHIT thank you. I was just ranting to my boyfriend last night in the grocery about how fucking deceptive that shit is. They do sell a lower sugar version, which is the "Zero" brand but the only visual difference (well, other than the word "Zero") is that the white and black on the label are reversed. I was trying to find one with 0 carbs and had no luck, but I have no idea where the carbs were coming from since it claimed they weren't from sugar. Using a name like "Vitamin Water" is like implying its healthy or good for you in some way. [Just look at this shit](http://vitaminwater.com/files/vitaminwater-base_rev_nut_facts_2015.pdf) (it's the nutrition facts, sorry it's a PDF I guess Coke wants to make it more annoying to look at so you are less likely to actually check it). 32 grams of sugar in 20oz (at least it isn't the 77g that Mountain Dew has, right? Chortle chortle chortle). I wish they would make food manufacturers include a fucking badge on sodas that specifies exactly how much sugar is in them, kinda like they sometimes do with calories on products to show off how great it is because its low calorie or low fat (even though it probably still has too much sugar and/or carbs).
Rock star energy water is where it's at! 
Have they added flavour yet?
That stuff is undrinkable no matter what the label says. 
Why is this news..?
Only took ten years. It tastes like shit anyways
Okay but are there vitamins?
Hey, let's make a label that looks like something you would get from the prescription counter at CVS!
 But why? "Coke" doesn't say "with sweeteners" on the label.
I can't believe anyone would ever drink that shit and not realize it's no different from Coke or Orange Juice, loaded to the brim with added sugars. I drink 2L Coke Zero a day but at least I'm not lying to myself. 
>the drinks have 33 grams of sugar and negligible amounts of juice, despite coming in flavours such as kiwi-strawberry and acai blueberry pomegranate.  
  
I'm staring at a bottle of gatorade right now that says 'cherry.'  Someone needs to put a stop to this!  I thought this was white colored cherry juice!  Is there just no limit to how evil corporations can be?!
No beveridge with calories should be allowed to be sold with "water" in the name.
SMH at people who think its healthy for you 
aren't vitamins fat soluble? so you need actual fat for vitamins to work.  otherwise you urinate the rest.
ITT: Consumers that like being exploited by companies. You idiots are a-OK with being lied to on the packaging. Why?

Are you so used to being lied to that you think it's OK? Why the fuck aren't you outraged companies flat out lie to you on packaging? Do you *like* being treated like idiots by corporations?

Have some self-respect and demand to be treated better, for fuck sake.
It was genius level marketing. They convinced so many people that it's healthy without outright saying it and managed to dismiss most of the criticism of false advertising. 
Yes we can see you are very smart, however corporations don't get a pass for deception because their consumers don't conduct a personal investigation into each product they buy first like you do. 
Or just uneducated and easily mislead, in which case fuck Coca Cola for taking advantage of them. And that's what this product is all about.
Delusional people need protection too. 
Isn't that the whole point of kidding yourself though, to be deluded?
Leave my passion fruit kool aid alone.
Not really, it has vitamins in it. Kool-aid doesn't, as far as I'm aware. If you want to drink kool-aid and get your daily vitamin intake for certain vitamins, this works. 
You could say they are...**drinking the kool-aid!!!**

*Puts on some glasses*

...*let's door hit self in ass on the way out.*
I am sure they mean if you go to a gas station.  A bottle of water can be more expensive than cheap beer.
The only way I can figure beer is cheaper is if you buy 6 bottles of water out of a vending machine for $1 each, vs a six pack of basic American brew for $5.99. This is using my local prices, mind you.
I live in New York City, and if there's beer cheaper than water, I've never seen it. Also, tap water here rules. That's actually why everyone wants to move here. 
The only way I think the comparison could possibly work is if the guy is looking at buying 24 separately sold 16oz bottles of water from like, a vending machine or airport shop (which should put them in the range of $1-$1.25 a bottle I think) to buying a 24 pack of 16oz cans of some sort of bottom tier beer at Walmart.
Uh, they said a bottle of water... Not jugs, not cases..
I drink them. for me its a first thing in the morning drink/replacement for coffee. I just dont like coffee, and this still has a decent caffeine kick. I actually like that its watered down. I like to drink a lot of water. im not saying this is like drinking water...its just i dont know... if you drink a lot of water, then soft drinks just taste way too nasty. I dont like soda because its way to sugary and sweet, and i dont like the sugar crashes. 

dont get me wrong, i have no delusions about this being a healthy drink or being good for me, but i do think its slightly better than regular soda. its also cheaper. the 7-11's around me always have like a 2 for $3 dollar deal on the bigger bottles, so I buy two and just save one for the next day. 

I would actually buy real fruit juice if I could find any on the shelves. Tropicana used to be awesome, now its totally processed and tastes like chemicals. 
Because it's like 88c a bottle at target?
You're giving it waaaay too much credit. This product contains a small fraction of the nutrition you'd get from a children's flinstone vitamin.
For the price of a vitamin water I think I could get like... 20 bananas.
No, it's sweetened water that contains vitamins.
You still are. 
Don't know about the US but when it first came to Canada it was absolutely marketed as a health drink. They placed it alongside all the other and the nutrition label was sparse at best 
A lot of these bullshit flavored "waters" have artificial sweeteners but dont say it anywhere on the label, you have to read the ingredients to find out. 
I can't see it well on mobile. Is that 32 grams of sugar in the "zero" version as well? 
Either that or you open a can and it says that there are 2 or 2.5 servings in it. Like anyone is going to put an open can back in the fridge for it to go flat and "enjoy" it later. 
It also doesn't make any health claims...
It's probably even worse than soda since they add pure fructose in addition to sugar.
Vitamin C and the B vitamins are water soluble, which means your body doesn't store them and they have to be replenished regularly.


It's always listed the sugar content in Palin sight though. 
It's disgusting how such an ego some of these people have. If Vitamin Water has sweeteners then it should be explicit, if the entire guise of not doing it is to fool "stupid" people, then it needs to change.
Yeah, it's not like there's a label listing the ingredients or nutritional value or anything. 
> conduct a personal investigation

Even if they can't read the label, they can taste that it is sweet.
> a personal investigation into each product they buy

It's not exactly hard to read the nutrition label and see that it's basically just sugar water.
A personal investigation?  You mean looking at the back of the bottle?
[deleted]
I'm assuming you haven't looked at the nutritional info on the label(personal investigation as you say), although a greater volume it has near or as much sugar as Coke. 

Edit: your name checks out 
>their consumers don't conduct a personal investigation into each product they buy first like you do. 

You mean like looking at a nutrition label?
Name check out.  "Mmm this water tastes so sweet!  How did they get water to taste sweet?  It must be voodoo."
Vitamin water is diluted.
Yeah, but doesn't it have _trace_ amounts of vitamins? Yes, that would be marginally better for you than kool-aid, but also false-advertising.
The vitamins will not be utilized by your body though, you're just making expensive pee.
I've never seen a 500ml bottle of water for more than $1.50 at a gas station. They're usually $1 or under. I mean, maybe if you're at some weird gas station in LA that only has FIJI and Keystone. 
In Canada, Beer is forbidden in Gas stations. Same goes for every other liquor.
The real question is do those cans add up to 3 litres of water? Typically they'll be closer to 2 litres. 
They said *bottled* water. Not, "a", just bottled. Bottled water comes in many different sizes, shapes and forms.

But as another user said, unless they're in one of the most expensive places in the country with some freak convenience store that only sells Fiji and Keystone, there's no way these numbers are even close.

If you can prove otherwise, please do so. I welcome it. 
Wow, there are a lot of retards replying to you.

It's like people think you should only drink water. You're not guzzling coke, you're not drinking juice, you're making healthier choices than 90% of Americans. And yet you're getting ripped for wanting to drink something with flavour in it. Wow.

More power to you man. I drink a lot of water. I've cut out Pepsi from my diet (although I have it on Sushi days). My vice is Tim Hortons ice caps. Sometimes I just need something flavourful, when water just don't hit the spot.
Where do you live that has no fruit juice on the shelves?
10 Years. Banned without reason. Farewell Reddit.

I'll miss the conversation and the people I've formed friendships with, but I'm seeing this as a positive thing. 

<3
> if you drink a lot of water, then soft drinks just taste way too nasty.

Is this a bad thing? You don't need soft drinks to live and you'll feel better when you drop your sugar and caffeine dependency. I promise. 

>Tropicana used to be awesome, now its totally processed and tastes like chemicals. 

So if you take away the "used to be awesome", like Vitamin Water?
Drink tap water. Use money saved to buy a multi vitamin. 

I just saved you about $30/month.

You are welcome.
Find a farmers market near you.

Also learn how to brew home made fruit juice. Simple as boiling a mesh of fruits on a low fire for several hours and adding a table spoon or two of sugar.

Every town/county here in California has something on the weekends.
You may be right. Perhaps its just a flavoring agent that tastes like the non-medical ingredients in flintstone vitamins. 
at 52 cents a pound I'm always surprised about how many you get for less than $3.00.
> marketed as a health drink

First red flag. 
I mean, isn't that enough? I read the ingredients of most things I ingest, why do we need an extra label when it's already listed?

> you have to read the ingredients to find out.

Or you can just not be dumb and use common sense.  If something has no/low calories and is really sweet then it contains artificial sweeteners.  Whoa.
Doesn't look like it. [Here is the zero version.](http://vitaminwater.com/files/vitaminwater_zero_NutritionFacts.pdf) I think go-go berry is delicious :(
well, not any more...
I don't think vitamin water does either. 
I agree, but i don't think that fructose is the biggest concern here.
I only drink water tbh. 
cool thanks, much cheaper to swallow a multivitamin a day with a meal
Nothing gets past the watchful eyes of Sarah Palin. 
Isn't it printed on the ingredients already?

Isn't that, like, the whole point of Public Relations?
Yes they are well trained and defend their corporate masters instinctively at the first sign of criticism. 
labels mean nothing in this country. Natural? never. Enriched? hardly. Made in the USA? wrong. 
The headline seems to say it wasn't on the label now doesn't it?
*takes sip*

"Wow, vitamin B tastes just like sugar! And so does vitamin A, and C!"
Lol, most people would assume vitamins are sweet, hahaha

It must be really potent, then.
No it has significant amounts.

3rd world country here, same 250ml size 
Foreign beer (Asahi, Budweiser) - 40-60 pesos per bottle
Foreign bottled water (Evian and Perier)  - 120 pesos 
There are a lot of gas stations in MA that have a $1 24oz Natty Light deal. I think an equivalent sized bottle of water is like 1.89
Pabst Blue Ribbon tallboys are like 88 cents at the gas station. Similar sized bottle of water can be $1.29. Granted, there are often 2 for 1 specials on water, but its not impoosible for beer to be cheaper than water. Demand dictates the price more than supply does. 
Hmmmm. Actually thinking about it, the water comes in 16.9 oz bottles, the beer in 16 oz. So the water would Still be less expensive per ounce.

I have no idea how much a 6 Canned of beer costs around here. I think I saw a 4 pack of big cans for $3.99, but it was NattyIce so I didn't really Look look.
Sorry but I'm not going to argue semantics over bottle and jug, no one calls a jug of water a bottle unless they are trying to win a semantics argument. 
One autist suggested I use a camelbak, lol. 


Christ reddit is full of retards.
Most places don't carry actual "juice". It says juice on the label, but that shit ain't juice. I don't consider anything "from concentrate" to be juice, and a lot of the other things with the word juice on the label say in fine print that it isn't even juice at all, but a juice flavored beverage or drink.

My mornings are a rush, I can barely stop at a 7-11, so I can't go to a nice grocery store, where they might have real juice....plus again, I want some caffeine, which even healthy real juice doesn't have.
> i have no delusions about this being a healthy drink or being good for me, but i do think its slightly better than regular soda

i guess you didnt read.

also, your numbers are wrong. compare the same sizes. 20oz coke is 65g of sugar, 20 oz vitamin water is 32. its literally half the sugar, so that actually is a big difference. it also has half the calories.I will admit, its not exactly "healthy" and even calling it "vitamin" water is a stretch...but it is a *healthier* option than soda.
a) fuck off with your hippie bullshit. 

>I promise. 

b) no you dont. if I chose not to drink whatever for however long and I didnt feel any better, you wouldnt do a god damn thing to make good on that promise, so you can take that promise and shove it up your ass. 

c) dont fucking judge someone without having all the information. i dont eat sweets like candy bars, chocolate and all that crap. its totally ok to consume *some* sugar in a diet. if i choose to get my sugar allotment for the day in the morning with some caffeine, its totally ok. 

who the fuck are you, Michael Bloomberg?

>Like Vitamin Water?

d)taste is subjective. it doesnt taste like chemicals to me. if it does to you, no one is making you buy it. im not telling you how to live your fucking life, so stop trying to tell me. seriously go fuck yourself. 
He seems to enjoy the flavor.
tap water tastes gross. it also isnt cold. it also isnt convenient. i also dont connect a garden hose 50 miles long to my car and drive around with a fucking kitchen sink installed in the truck you fucking moron...but I guess you didnt think of that, because you dont ever leave mom's basement.

like anything you buy at a *convenience* store, much of the price you are paying is not for the product, but for the *convenience*

i honestly dont give a shit about the vitamins either way. 

i'm just thirsty, and want some caffeine because i just woke up. caffeine is something else tap water doesn't have. there arent a ton of other choices at the store. 

most of the juices they carry are from concentrate which you couldnt pay me to drink. soda has double the sugar and calories. 

>$30/month

sorry, i dont subscribe to /r/frugal because im not *that* fucking poor that I would have to worry about it.

Did you really just suggest a procedure that takes "several hours" to replace an on the go beverage?  

You want people to go to market, bring back a bunch of fruit, get out a pan, prepare and clean up all the fruit mess, babysit this slop for "several hours", clean the slimy pan, and find a container and space to store it,  rather than *buying a fucking bottle off a shelf* on the way to work?

Do you take your clothes down to the river and beat them on rocks?  The same clothes that you made by harvesting the cotton and spinning it into yarn and sewing with your own two little hands?

What the fuck is wrong with you?
Get a load of this hippie.
if I was going to bother with boiling anything for a caffiene fix, i would just make tea. 

I dont have time for that shit, not in the morning anyways.
Advertising laws and general concern.
Of course this is after you buy it, take a drink, are disgusted, and then some moron on the internet says some dumbshit without using reading comprehension. 
Thanks! I always read everything. Like a maniac! And, I didn't think I'd missed that. They use Stevia, which I'm sure we'll find out some time in the future, is killings us as well! 
Except for the vitamin part misleading people 
And the sugar content. And the taste.
Of course it is. I picked up a bottle of the stuff once, read the label, and recognised it for what it was. Took a few seconds. Most people don't bother reading labels though.
Eh, most people who read them don't even know what half of the stuff on the labels is anyway, let alone the effects it has on your body.

I don't understand people like you. Every time there is a thread like this, people like you pop in and say, "meh, you are responsible for reading the fine print".

Why the fuck do you people try to distract from the fact that corporations are *lying to you with impunity* on the front of the product?? 

Do you *like* being lied to? Are you so used to being lied to that you think it's OK?

**Stop defending predatory practices, you self-hating idiot. You are defending the very people that are exploiting you**.

Your username is very ironic. 
http://www.betterfitnessdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/vitamin-water-label-2.jpg

It is on the label, people are just too lazy to read.
Only people who've never actually taken vitamins would assume that.


Then they don't deserve their money. 
The words "with sweeteners" were not on the front label, sure. 

But all food sold in the US and Canada is required to list the full ingredients, ordered by amount in the product. And all food sold is required to have a standardized nutritional information label, which would clearly indicate protein, fats, and carbohydrates. In Canada, it will be on there in both English and French.
Well but you could read the nutrition facts and see that they have approximately 30g of sugar, so that's probably what u/NakedAndBehindYou meant. Although, I guess the point is that your average person may not realize how many grams of sugar they're supposed to consume daily.
The article says that they must now add the words "with sweeteners" to the bottle.

But if you read the nutrition label, the fact that they have almost as much sugar as a regular can of Coke is already on there. Anyone with a brain can figure out that "with sweeteners" is already implied by listing 33 grams of sugar in a bottle of fluid.
You keep posting the same thing over and over. The stupid is indeed strong.
Evian is always more expensive than beer, unless you country has high alcohol tax.

It's that premium mountain water taste!
What's the cheapest price for a bottle of water, local or foreign? Obviously there are cheap beers and expensive waters. Is there not cheap waters and expensive beers? Evian and Perier are some of the more expensive water brands.
What's a lot compared to all the gas stations? Nestle Pure Life bottles where I live go for $0.75-$1 for 50oz and I'm only a few hours from MA.
No one said it is impossible. You're just representing an atypical case which has already been mentioned. 
If you're buying a 6 pack for $6 then you are buying 12oz cans/bottles of beer.  101.4 oz of water vs 72 oz of beer.
Um, you're the one that started with the semantics bullshit? It's all bottled water. All of it is bottled, whether the bottle is a gallon, a liter, or 16.9oz. I have literally never heard of anyone having a problem calling a gallon of water a bottle until you. 

So put up or shut up. If you don't have numbers to prove even that *your* claim that *a* bottle of water is more expensive than beer, what are you arguing for?
You get the shaft if you buy your groceries at 7-11.  I suggest you go to a real food store.

While it is better than coke, an adult male should only consume 37.5 grams of added auger per day. I'm not saying you shouldn't drink it but I won't touch the stuff. I've had to point the amount of sugar out to friends who think they're doing themselves a healthy favor by drinking it.
Calling it healthier made me laugh. While technically correct, that is still over the recommended daily intake of sugar. 


Don't kid yourself, you are still practically drinking soda. 

Edit: Oh, the downvotes for calling someone's bullshit out. Thanks, Reddit, you rock!
You sound like a very angry man/woman, sure you're getting all your vitamins?
No one asked you to defend your shitty taste to us. If you didn't want people calling you out for your bullshit excuses as to why you *need* vitamin water, you shouldn't have posted. 

You have a serious problem if someone challenging your eating habits makes you this angry.
Damn bro, a filter and water bottle would solve your hose conundrum.  They probably have spring water at your job to refill, or you can bring extra water bottles and put one in the fridge at work.  If not, then i guess you have a point.  
Okay deep pockets.

Buy a Brita pitcher for your refrigerator and a Camelbak water bottle for leaving the house.

You do know that Coca Cola uses municipal water to "make" Dasani and Vitamin Water don't you? They run it through an activated charcoal filter just like a Brita filter but obviously on a larger scale.

I'm pretty sure I just walked onto the set of a Portlandia sketch.
3 hours to make 5+ gallons of juice sounds like a steal to me!

Only takes 5 minutes to cut everything up and throw it into a pot.

The 3 hours you could be doing something else.

The only thing wrong with your reasoning is that you haven't realized that the several hours it takes to brew the juice cocktail, is the same in relation to the 1 1/2 hours it takes to wash your clothes.

You're not actually doing the work, the washing machine and drier are, same way with a pot on low fire on the stove.

Also, I prefer using my soggy fruits instead of throwing them all away as compost - I do that after I drain the juices from the pot.
Hey not everyone runs on your sensibilities. My wife and I make all our soaps and cleaning supplies. We never eat or drink anything that's in a box, everything's is made of fresh materials. Yeah it takes a while to make things, even on the go things. But just because you prefer to sacrifice your personal health for convenience doesn't mean there's something wrong with anyone else who might make a suggestion that results in more work. Doesn't work for you then I back to drinking whatever you feel like but don't act like the suggestion was bad just because you don't have or want to spend the time to try it. 

Tldr; there's nothing wrong with them. They just do things differently and wanted to make a suggestion. There's something wrong with you though if you assume they must have a defect for deciding to make their own things so they know what's in it. If you don't have the time then don't do it but there's no reason to assume that your way is the only way. 
Yeah there are many thing people can't do, most people are too busy to prepare themselves a meal let alone a beverage.
The guy who wants ingredients listed on the label as well as in the ingredients list ON THE LABEL is calling my comment 'dumbshit'?  
Yeah, most of the Zeros have close to no sugar, but they do have randomly undisclosed carbs (usually most carbs in drinks are from sugar). They're not bad, neither are the Powerade Zero drinks.
It has vitamins in it. It's a fact. 
Or the print is too small for them to read. Gotta cram that fucking spanish named shit on the exact same label.
It clearly states caloric content as well as sugar. You don't need a degree to know what sugar is. 
[deleted]
No one was lying. The nutrition label and ingredients list are completely honest. Should labels also have to plaster "MADE WITH WATER" "MADE WITH FOOD COLORING" " MADE WITH OLIVE OIL" "MADE WITH BACON" and so forth when it's all very clearly laid out on the back label? Seems a bit absurd. 
I think the labels are carefully designed with the intent to mislead rather than lie. Whereas I don't think that's ethical, there is a distinction. 


But did you even read the label on your own link?

Do you know why there are ingredients on labels? Because corporations lied about what is in their products and were forced by regulations to start putting labels on.

Now they are still doing the next best thing.  Lying on the front and then hiding the truth in tiny print.

The problem is corporate deception. 
And let's not forget to mention that the poster I quoted specifically said "in the US." 
I viewed it as local good vs foreign goods you find in the supermarket, and people have the mentality that foreign goods are automatically better. 

Cheapest alcohol can be found at 20 pesos, while bottled water which is practically tap at 10. Decent brands would be at 35 for the beer and 25 for the water. 

Considering the latter prices, if you're dining outside you get more value for money with the beer and asking for tap in the restaurant. 
Basically any gas station in western MA that sells beer. (Which I thought wasn't legal in MA... No idea why certain gas stations seem to get an exemption. If anyone knows the answer to that, I would love to hear it.) 
Not atypical. That's most gas stations.
Thanks! I see I screwed up in that bottles of beer are 12oz not 16. 
No, I didn't.  The guy was clearly talking about BOTTLES of water. Not jugs, you are the one who tried to use semantics to put jugs in. Why not call water towers bottled water while you're at it?
I don't buy groceries at 7-11, I but convienance items.Jesus Christ, do you stop people at a vending machine and try to give them financial advice too. Fuck off already.
Where'd you hear 37.5? That's an unusually random sounding number, esp the .5 part.  
The RDA for sugar is established at 25g per day, AFAIK. You could plausibly come up with a grams/kg, but that's more of a bodybuilder past time.
Sugar withdrawal, someone get a Snickers bar!
I enthusiastically rant, and enjoy the use of gratuitous profanity. My friends say I remind them of Dennis Leary. 

Plus reddit is full of autists....so there is reason to be angry. People with ideas this bad, shouldn't congregate.
Why do people do this anyway? What do they hope to accomplish?
im just sick of peoples hippie Feelgood bullshit. 

I never fucking said I *need* it. It's just a god damned beverage. Fuck.

Did you get vaccinated? I'm trying to collect sole data for a study on autism.
Oh get off your high horse, you pretentious Portlander-wannabe.
I'm not primitive at all, I'm 16 years old working 80 hours every 2 weeks and attending my Junior year in highschool.

I just happen to be an average cook who knows a few common traditional methods of making the goods that people love.

The amount of negativity for something as easy as learning how to boil a pot of water and adding rice is beyond me. 

Also it doesn't take up "3 hours" of your scheule, rather 5 minutes, the rest is waiting, you don't even have to watch a stove fire on the lowest setting especially when you have 5 gallons of water sitting on top with the lid slightly open.
When you say "undisclosed carbs", do you mean there are carbs that aren't on the label? I'm just curious.
Enough to find some valid stuff, and some conspiratory "this causes cancer and autism" nonsense. There's a reason why it's so widely held that aspartame and MSG is bad for you.

EDIT: phrasing
The headline seems to say it wasn't on the label now doesn't it?
Sugar is the second and third ingredient, 6g of sugar per 100ml. Did you read the label?
Add adult multivitamin gummies to that list 
I would just love to know why I can get 50oz of water for a dollar or less at pretty much every gas station around and you can't even though you are only a few hours away. Does MA have a water tax? There would be companies all over that area to sell water cheaper if $1.89 is the best price for 24oz of water.  I'm calling bullshit. 
So that's a no, you don't have anything to back up what you're claiming then? Okay. Thanks for your useless contribution. Happy to argue about the semantics of bottles vs jugs with you.
You're welcome.
"The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) of added sugar per day for women and 9 teaspoons (38 grams) for men."

I hate Dennis Leary for exactly this reason.  

Your friends may be used to you but to other people you just appear like a shallow asshole hiding behind the anonymity of your fake name here.  

You'd never act like this in person, right?  So don't do it here either.

I get confused looks from baristas in airports and cities all over the country.

"Coffee black"
"Cream or sugar?"
"Black"
"Okay*mumbles weirdo*"



People don't like being told to be nice to one another damn. Calm down there. 
I totally used the wrong word. I meant "undefined." The ingredients for one I picked out (Lemonade) are as follows:
reverse osmosis water, less than 1% of: erythritol,
citric acid, calcium phosphate, magnesium lactate
and calcium lactate and potassium phosphate
(electrolyte sources), gum acacia, phosphoric
acid, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), stevia leaf extract,
natural flavors, zinc gluconate, glycerol ester of
rosin, vitamin B5 (calcium pantothenate), vitamin E
(alpha-tocopheryl acetate) vitamin B6 (pyridoxine
hydrochloride), vitamin A palmitate

I'm pretty sure some of it comes from the "gum acacia" which is an emulsifier so probably carbs. Maybe the rest from sugar alcohols (though "less than 1%"?).

Also, there's definitely a bunch of people (possibly wackadoodles) who will claim citric acid is pretty bad for you, too. I don't subscribe to that, but who knows.
A sweetened up sports drink with aspartame is not "good" for you either. When will America figure out that the way to be healthy is eating fresh foods, not processed crap.

I've been off all processed foods for a month (minus beer, cause I love that shit) and I feel so much better and happier. Diet is a huge part of mind state 
Dude. Learn to read the article and not just the headline. It was on the nutrition label. It was in the ingredients list. It just wasn't called out on the front in big bold font large enough for dumbasses to notice. People like you are the reason coffee cups come with a disclaimer that coffee is hot. 
>You'd never act like this in person

Do you think my friends say I remind of Leary just because?

Don't tell me how to act. 

And yes, if I was in 7-11 and someone started lecturing me about my beverage chtoice that drag, Icertainly would tell them to Fuck off. 

If anything YOU would lecture strangers like this in the real world, so maybe YOU are the one who shouldn't do it here. 
Thanks for the explanation. Although I rarely partake of any soft drinks and drink mostly water, I enjoy the lemonade zero version occasionally in the summer and wanted to make sure it's not total junk.  
Wow, a month! Tell us more about America!
Naw, coffee cups come with that disclaimer because McDonald's was preparing their coffee to a temperature that would make it so the coffee was still hot after people finished their commute. It was like 40 degrees higher than typical restaurants brew their coffee and like 60 degrees higher than typical households. 

A person was seriously burned when the coffee spilled in their lap and it was found to be unreasonable for a person to expect their beverage to be that hot. 
Why not?  You're a prick to strangers all the time here.  I'm just acting the same as you.
Yeah, the lemonade is really good. They have a dragonfruit Zero that I like a lot, also. A surprisingly good drink, though it is an "energy drink" and technically a soda, is the Monster Zero Ultra Citron. It's like a sparkling lemonade soda, and is low on carbs (though it does have sugar alcohols, so you'll have to know if you like them or not). I like to have one every once in a while as a  refreshing sweet treat.
You try not eating ANY added sugar for a month, and get back to me. 
We're not talking about McDonalds. We're talking about every single cup of coffee, every small piece of plastic, and every knife that warns you about being hot, a choking hazard, or sharp, because otherwise some dumbass would sue because you didn't state the obvious. You're the reason we can't have Kinder eggs and toys in cereal.
You aren't the same as me at all, because I don't give a Fuck what other people eat or drink, or where they shop, and I don't hassle them over it...


That is what puts you in the wrong and makes you a bigger asshole.
And unicorns will fart rainbows. 
I'll believe it when i see it. These guys are old hands ar paying lip service.
Translation:   81 big companies saw a gravy train and want their share of the Federal pork for making tiny, tiny policy changes in exchange for billion$ in subsidies.
Walmart only joins these things to attempt to offset their horrible employee/employer reputations.
Lol Reddit you never cease to amaze me. An article by Vox or The Guardian about how corporations and the wealthy have absolute control over the government with very vague sources will be accepted without question, but if an article comes out that says there is a combined effort by these same corporations to fight global warming you immediately dismiss it and demand that they must have a secret plot or some other alternative. It's like the only way to go green is to be anti-capitalism and if a corporation does well because of it then clearly something is wrong and they must be punished.
corporate version of hashtag activism. Hopefully they post it to their facebook status update and color their profile photo green and we'll have the problem solved in no time.
Okay, okay. Here's your bribe. Now call of your agencies.
WTF, McDonald's. That doesn't sound like something your shareholders would be receptive to right now unless, of course, they know it's fake.
[deleted]
so the most evil companies on earth all agree on something. this should turn out great.
How about committing to taking sugar and carbs out of people's diets?
This sounds like the sort of thing corporations join to avoid the penalties if they don't join.  Sort of like the tactics used by Reverend Al Sharpton.
Lies. How is a company (McDonalds), who's job it is to sell cheap, crappy food, going to help with global warming when their entire existence depends on cow and chicken mega farms, which happen to pollute more greenhouses gases than all the cars, trucks, trains, ships, and planes in the US combined? It's just a PR stunt as others have said. Makes me sick. 
81 consumer facing companies agree to PR campaign with Obama, make no firm commitments to actually *do* anything at all.
[deleted]
Here's a plan: make items locally so you don't have to ship it from China!
So... making a bunch of fortune 500 companies change their business habits through legislation is what you’d normally expect out of a president or US legislator. Talking them into doing it themselves without going to all the trouble to make a law is, well, a little unconventional and kind of the out-of-the-box thinking we'd hope expect from someone like the big D.

Of all the things Obama has done so far, assuming this is as true as it sounds on its face, this is as close to genius for a US president as it gets. He just asked them if they would do something, and they thought about it, and then they said “yeah, I guess we could do that.” WTF is THAT. 535 senators and congressmen in DC and Obama TALKS these companies into this! WHY THE F__ DID WE ELECT THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE!?

So, will this work? Think about it I guess. Walmart tells everyone… wait, bad example. No one who shops at Walmart gives a shit if their saving the environment. General Motors tells everyone that they’ve decided to voluntarily work towards cutting carbon emissions by doing all this stuff these other companies are doing. If Ford doesn’t get on board with the program I’m going to have to start buying GMs instead. Not because I like GMC, but I’ll feel a little better buying a car from a company that pulled it head out of its ass and realized that it may actually be part of the problem. Besides, one domestic (US) automaker is about as reliable and trustworthy as another (I’m not inviting a debate on that statement, as to respond to that statement would no doubt end in a county western song of some sort).

I don’t know if humans are entirely responsible for climate change, but I think we’ve played a part in it if we’re not almost completely responsible. And what’s important, is that there are lot more people like me in America than there are those who that think that statement is total bullshit. I’m part of the purchasing power that most of these companies would like to retain in the rest of this decade. And as marketing goes, you don’t have to make your market happy as much as you have to be the best choice available. If all the choices are shitty, then the companies that are the least shitty, as in price vs. value, are the companies that are going to succeed. All other things being equal, if I can know which purchase is going to be the best for the environment, and know that the claim has some sort of objective third party verification, I’ll go with that purchase.

So a Democrat president basically implemented a conservative, capitalistic, truly Republican policy on environmental protection. So is the policy bullshit? Maybe. But, and here’s the dreamer in me, what if the market took all the bullshit out of it? Think about it; do you buy milk that doesn’t have a no-BGH label on it? Can you even find milk that has bovine growth hormone in it anymore? If the market started buying products that make the claim that they’re zero-carbon-impact, and were willing to pay more for that statement, and had a way to know that the statement was genuine, then companies have to change to meet the demands of the new market. It’s the bottom-up approach policy implementation that you hear people talk about but never actually implement.

If Walmart does this and Amazon doesn’t, I guess I’m using Walmart.com even if they are slightly more expensive.

They've all installed new departments within the organization.  They will be called, "Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic" or RDCOT.  They will put some top people on the project.  Much will be made of RDCOT, lots of money will be spent on RDCOT, many meetings will be held, but in the end, it's all just rearranging the deck chairs.  Damn, I need some coffee.

With the profit motive, we will not see significant change even if these companies want to make us all feel better, (so that we'll buy more stuff).
How the heck is McDonald's going to help when the biggest cause of global warming is animal agriculture?
It's all for the good pr and EPA subsidies!
Let's all pay some carbon tax and pass it on to the consumer.
So is this bullshit, or do they just realize it's hard to do business when you're underwater?
You can't combat something you're not affecting.  If these mega corporations are involved, you KNOW this thing is a scam. 
So they'll sell less meat? Watch the documentary about the animal food industry.. Cowspiracy...amazing points on climate change... resource management (water and land) 
Are any of those companies the top 5 oil producers? Because if it isnt, then its all a waste of time. 
Really? Then take the palm oil out of your food. 

Fucking hypocrites. 
"Walmart, McDonalds, and 79 others commit to new advertising campaign to revive free-falling stocks and revenues"
Talk is cheap. Put up or shut up.
Actions speak louder than words, we will see won't we.
Now if only we can get them to commit to fighting slave wages...
Commit to pay lip service to climate change, more likely.

I'll wait till them doing something impacts their bottom line to find out how "serious" they are about it.
Good for them!  We are way too late about preparing this planet for the future
Right..... sure they are. 
Global warming is a debunked hoax.
Lol. Yeay. All the corporations are going to do their share to be carbon neutral. 

And still the earth gets warm... Lol. 

I'm a socialist, I control the weather, the seasons, and the climate. My hubris. 
How about to committing to treating their employees like human beings. 
I guess McDonald's is planning on living out its final days as the good guy 
So... McDonald's is going to stop cutting down the rainforest to farm cattle and Walmart is going to stop shipping in goods from China? I bet Exxon will be the next to sign up and stop selling gasoline.
40 years too late. watch the docu "Merchants of Doubt.'
They must have run out of places to place their headquarters, Where there is no acid rain... only reason i can think of why they are getting interested in the environment.
Give us 1% more money as we raise our fists against the atmosphere! 
Lip service, cost = 0. PR from lip service = priceless.

I've been feeding mine Skittles for years, still nothing
Your sarcasm is truly unfounded. I am an environmental researcher for a major Midwestern university and most of the research I do investigates Supply Chain Governance and Demand Side Levers for conservation, AKA 'how can companies be more environmentally friendly'. Now don't get me wrong, there are plenty of 'bad' things a lot of these companies do for the environment but they are actually trying and succeeding in some very successful conservation efforts that are being lead not by government but by these companies. Most of the work I do involves McDonalds and the Brazilian soy sector. If anyone is interested in knowing more I'd be happy to answer any questions. 
What's their incentive to even try and improve things if you're all going to cynically dismiss it?
Yeah I'm sick of all of these commitments to do something about the environment sometime in the future when hopefully everyone forgets about it.
Do you actually pay any attention to what's actually being done? Because you won't see anything if your eyes are closed. 
Don't be so glib, I'm an environmental researcher that has been studying some of what these companies have just signed up for, mostly Supply Chain Governance and Demand Side Levers for conservation. [Here is a very short article about what specifically McDonalds has done and the impacts it had on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.](http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/01/29/how-changing-your-diet-saving-amazon-rainforest) I helped write the study mentioned in the article.

When mega corps start pushing an idea, it's time to consider whether it's a good idea.
They are selling us the rope they'll hang is with.
So? At least they're helping combat emissions 
ding ding ding ding we have a winner!
Yep. If they were actually concerned we would see a movement away from animal products. But that would hurt the all mighty profit. 
All of these company's only join these things to get good PR. 
Unfortunate Wal-Mart employee here, can confirm everything said above. 
Oh please, Walmart shil.
My experience is the opposite. "May I have some ketchup?" one packet. "May I have some more?" one packet.

Where the fuck do you live? The default here is you get none unless you ask, and even then it's 2-3 max...
They're going to cause global cooling!

Prepare for a long winter my friends.
SO, serious question here...

Are we completely jaded on the idea that a company can change?

I mean, seriously, what if Walmart had a sudden change in direction, and went all green, pushed renewable R&D, paid living wages to workers?  I mean, they are already raising their pay.

Are we going to allow them to do the right thing, or will we hate them no matter what they do?
What? Your point makes no sense. Where the hell does Al Sharpton come into play here?
I understand your doubts, but surely because they are so responsible, it HAS to be them that make a change?
Presumably there will only be veggie burgers at McDonald's from this point on.
Not to forget, they need more and more farmland which is gained by destroying forests which makes air pollution even worse...
Trying to push your propaganda on new subreddits, eh? You of all people should know that "PR campaigns" are an effective way to change attitudes. The more the average American is going to see that McDonalds and Wal-Mart care about climate change, the less likely they're going to be to fall for the lies of the fossil fuel industry.

I see you've also been trying to push the notion that Trudeau is a "lukewarmer"...I guess you guys will be busy selling that narrative in advance of Paris, where Trudeau wants to go personally to take an active role.

The truth is that AGW deniers lost big last night. I expect the ramping up of their online disinformation in the coming weeks.
if people don't trust them, then they probably earned that reputation.

I think its more of a "I'll believe it when I see effective, not-made-up, results" rather than a "damned if they do, damned if they don't"

They just have to *actually* do things with good intention, and maybe they wont *actually* be damned... otherwise they can just shut the fuck up and go back to fucking their employees like they *actually* do, which is why they *actually* suck. 
They've well and truly earned that reputation. If they put up instead of blowing smoke up our asses then maybe one day people won't automatically assume they have ulterior motives.
>  No one who shops at Walmart gives a shit if their saving the environment

I don't understand this logic. I shop there because it's the closer supermarket to my house and I would rather pay $1.40 for a entire pineapple versus $5 at Publix or Wholefoods. (random example that happened to me recently)
Word. Like it or not, capitalism made the mess and it will have to get us out of it, i.e. popularizing more sane product choices. One very good idea Bob Zubrin details is simply getting Congress to mandate that all new cars sold in the US are Flex-Fuel. A simple idea with so many positive worldwide repurcussions.
For a giant comment, that was surprisingly positive and intelligent!
> So they'll sell less meat?

That's pretty tough to do at McDonalds. The meat patties on a Big Mac couldn't satisfy a super model.

I've been considering it. 

How much animal abuse is depicted? 
Paul McCartney does a lot about how much meat production goes into global warming
Global earning is nothing but a lie.
Prove it.
This.  The climate humpers are insane.
Climate change is the biggest threat of our time -environmentalist thumpers
> and stop raising cattle for the sole purpose of creating meat.

Other than milk, there really is no other purpose. This war on beef is silly. If cattle didn't exist, wouldn't a natural species take it's place? Long before there were cows in this country, there were buffaloes. But I guess somehow they didn't produce greenhouse gases. 

And what of the native bovids that cover the entire landscape. Should we also eliminate them? Because without cattle, we know their numbers will explode. Clearly they have similar digestive systems that produce greenhouse gases.
You are putting them in the wrong end
Try skittles and club soda
What entity funds you and your research?
Many of these companies know that they have to change cause their businesses are not sustainable in a more resource scarce future. It's easy to think they are run by evil robots who only care about profit, but the fact of the matter is that change is hard when you are a multi billion dollar company with shareholders to please 
They threw out their need to be respectable because it wasn't worth anything. Why should I pretend they haven't?
Because their incentive is money, period. This talk of a "voluntary soy moratorium" pasted all over these comments was only "volunteered" after PETA went after McD's publicly and their stock prices took a hit. The government announcing that they are fixing things with the giant corporations that own said government is silly and people no longer buy it. 
[deleted]
Hey buddy, how about a little proof? You seem to be crusading the thread and I for one will be glad to hand over some upvotes with proof that what you claim about yourself is true.
Ever heard of cost-benefit analysis?   If it costs us hundreds of billions of dollars to push an emissions program that has so little impact nobody can even detect the difference, was it worth it?    

We could probably make a car that's virtually impossible to crash or be injured by, but if it costs $10 million per car, who'd own one except the ultra wealthy?   Cost-benefit has to play a role, even when discussing environmental or government policy.
Ah yes, "corporate responsibility." Sad that we had a practice devoted specifically to that.
Exactly. Just keep them in a bag in the fridge. It's free condiments. 

Great for camping too.
zombie apocalypse?  They should survive any nuclear war or zombies!
They are hard as fuck to rip sometimes and spit out the equivalent of a single skittle.
Everyone has their own standards.     
    
I haven't stepped foot in a Walmart since the late '90s resultant of their labor abuses. They could win me back, but it would take a lot more than reducing their pollution and wasting less. Those are important issues and I'm glad they're jumping on the bandwagon, but they've made way too many half-assed efforts for PR's sake for me to take this seriously. If (optimistically, when) we see verifiable results, I might, might consider going there if they also stop being horrible to their workers and stop leaching off the communities of which they're a part.     
     
Alternatively, my wife gave up her same boycott after their program to sell local produce (part M. Obama's health kick). She goes there a few times per year now (basically whenever she's in a pinch and Costco, Target and local shops are closed). Walmart's partnership in this sort of environment program would help my wife defend her patronage of Walmart whenever I discover she went there and begin questioning her moral fortitude (it's a fun game we play).          
      
Lastly, my grandpa refused to patronize Walmart because they "only sell worthless Chinese junk" (his words). Then he found out that they sold some gun he likes, and a reputable car battery brand, and now he goes there a few times a month. He isn't happy about their union busting practices, but he can look past that because he thinks their high-quality products are testaments to their customer service (again, his view, not mine).    
    
Anyway, the point is that the more good things they do, the more they'll win back consumers. Even the most rigid boycotters (like me) can forgive mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, we're all just people, Walmart management included. I mean, they make much shittier mistakes on a much larger scale, but they could stop being assholes, and I think most of us would eventually let their past bs slide.
Merely stating that joining a consortium to fight global warming led by the White House may be easier for a corporation than not joining and facing various audits and penalties because they did not join.  Al Sharpton regularly extorts money from corporations by getting this to give money to his organization, rather than be threatened with non-specific charges of racism.  
Exactly. The level of cynicism in this thread and /r/news in general is unbelievable. Often times, it's in a companies best interest to reduce energy usage and waste. With congress in absolute gridlock, the executive branch *should* be working with these companies to reduce carbon emissions in any way possible, especially if reducing emissions can benefit the companies *and* the environment. 
McD's "meat" has been mostly not meat (soy) for a long, long time. They switched to 100% beef for a few months in the early 2000's. Not surprisingly, they didn't promote their switch back to soy quite as much as their switch from soy to beef. 
While I agree, McD's did help reduce deforestation in Brazil when they refused to source soy from farms that grow crops on logged land. [source](http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/01/29/how-changing-your-diet-saving-amazon-rainforest).     
      
So, they aren't always sacrificing the environment for profit, although, they do that plenty, too..     
      
Edit: my point is that there is basis for optimism, very skeptical optimism.
[deleted]
good point. i was trying to pick on Walmart, but i wound up picking on its patrons instead. My bad.
indeed. however, i'd suggest a policy of compelling inclusion rather than selective exclusion. or to be more specific, require all gas stations to sell alternative fuels. If you want to test the market for a demand, you've got crack the door to see if it's there. if you know that you can buy ethanol fuel or park and get an electric charge somewhere, then those options will influence your decision on what sort of car to buy. But, either option would work. the latter gives the consumer control over the issue though.
[deleted]
some..the documentary is more about how much nothing is done by the organizations that are supposed to care about water conservation, deforestation, etc:)
Funny how organizations that are supposed to come up with plans and actions barely touch the meat industry 
Can't prove something that doesn't exist doesn't exist 
I think it's funny that these idiots care more about some lie than the real danger of Islam.
well the two heads of cattle per acre would help the problem instead of four heads every few square meters.
Most of our funding comes from the [Gordon and Betty Moore foundation](https://www.moore.org/about), NASA and the Norwegian Environment Agency (Norway is huge on global deforestation and funds lots of research, [they just paid Brazil 1 billion dollars](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/us-climatechange-amazon-norway-idUSKCN0RF1P520150915) to slow deforestation) So, our research is NOT corporate funded.

*grammar edits
>When we call for change it always ends up being policy that help them and crush use more.

Well I have some great news for you. People and groups can have a large impact on the environment by pressuring companies to do the right thing. Since 2006 in Brazil there has been something called the 'Soy Moratorium' in effect. It is any agreement signed by major soy traders in Brazil not to buy soy grown on areas deforested after 2006 and it has been extremely effective in reducing deforestation related to soy expansion. The reason the soy traders signed onto this agreement was because of pressure from Green Peace along with McDonalds and other corporations that have soy in their supply chain, to cut down on direct deforestation for soy expansion. The reason McDonalds and other corporations pushed for this is because their costumer base started demanding that the products had less impact on the environment. 
What proof would you like? Here is the link to my [research lab](http://www.gibbs-lab.com/) and [published paper the above article is based off of](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6220/377.full?ijkey=DY9/lnsvOM5iQ&keytype=ref&siteid=sci)
Oh, yeah okay I see 
[deleted]
I am thinking it is time to abandon /r/news for a new news, this place is a complete shit hole, I feel like these are the comments C&P'd from YouTube.
Again, you're simply trying to push a fabricated narrative. The fact is that AGW deniers suffered a huge loss last night, and you're simply trying to put a positive spin on it (because that is what you always do).
Thank you! I will definitely watch it then. 
Much like the solution to antibiotic resistance is all about doctors prescribing antibiotics and never about a reduction in antibiotic laced feed. 
That problem will fix itself as people are eating healthier hopefully (actually I doubt it, but it would be nice)
 Your statement is invalid.
Cool

Have you published any papers?

I'd love to read some
You really think the consumer has any influence? It's not real control. Big companies do just enough to keep the masses satisfied while creating more leverage for themselves. 
Are these companies your researching losing significant profit by implementing these changes? If they are starting to value the environment over the bottom line then that would be am interesting sign.
I saw one of these in my friends house! Where do you get them?
Unsure.. economic growth in China has increased beef and pork consumption.. as more forests are turned into pastures or animal feed agricultural land 
So is the "science" behind the global warming lie.
I've been co-author on a few and the rest of our small lab has been very busy this year http://www.gibbs-lab.com/recent-publications/
This is the paper I have been referencing in this thread http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/347/6220/377?ijkey=DY9/lnsvOM5iQ&keytype=ref&siteid=sci
He just cited how customers HAVE influenced business. 
I honestly think that consumers in some instances do/will have an influence to push companies in certain directions. 
Indirectly. While I can't say for certain since I am not in the room when these decisions are made, companies HATE bad press and boycotts (real or perceived) so when consumers and NGO's such as Green Peace start linking McDonalds burgers to direct deforestation of the Amazon (soy is grown to feed cattle) and it starts to get press they don't like that. 

Now I imagine the Soy Moratorium supported by McDonalds hasn't done much to raise the price of soy to cut into their profit margin and if it did maybe they would have never signed onto it but the point is people can put pressure on companies about environmental conservation and these companies than can pressure other companies down the supply chain and have a large impact. 
Chik-fil-a has them.
Link with proof?
Genius. You just doxxed yourself. 
I bet they never saw that coming..  
Are they sure it wasn't a Pepsi in disguise?
Brown, 6ft, with a red cap.
This sounds like an inside job.  Only someone associated with that restaurant would know that the cash had not been dropped from the night before, or that anyone would be present at 6 AM.  The coke costume probably indicates some level of preparation on the part of the perpetrator.  I'm guessing the intent was introduce a wild card element to distract investigators.
They probably still asked if he wanted to buy a drink to go with the Big Buford.
Share a coke with....the mgr. of Rally's
The whole set of circumstances is great. 
Goddamn Dr Pepper people coming out of the earth and psychically draining us of our caffeine. 
False flag
Yep, only the manager was there?  Sounds like he did it, " coke costume, sounds too crazy to be made up!"
Except the armed robbery part....?
Obviously yes, but he was there for hours scoping out several different places early in the morning according to Taco Bell workers. Then says he's doing a promotion for Taco Bell and needs more napkins.
Hah, the real trick here is the Taco Bell uses Pepsi products!
It's funny how the outrage is about using a language other than English instead of hijacking patriotism for corporate marketing.
You'd have be a true idiot to get mad because someone spoke another language.
[deleted]
Because I believe the best about humankind, I'm just going to assume that the "outrage" was because an international corporation with a spotty track record on many issues co-opted a wonderful, patriotic, song, in order to shill unhealthy sugar water to millions of Americans.

Right?
Oh no, outrage on Twitter.

Those morons will get mad if ketchup isn't just the right shade of red.

1) America the Beautiful is not the official national anthem.

2) This is America you're free to speak/sing/talk in any language.

3) I might be stretching out here but you're singing to the time of the British National Anthem "God save the Queen."

4) You missed the gay couple in the commercial.
I watched this commercial [and the super bowl] with a friend of mine who happens to be super right-wing conservative, and yeah, he hated it. When he said "they should be singing this in English" I thought he was joking at first, but he was not joking. 
Was there a part of it Hindi? i thought I heard a bit of Hindi; but it was butchered like an American trying to sing in Hindi.
Sometimes I really feel bad about my country.  Like, you know, now.
It's all about marketing. Coca-cola sells its products all over the world.
Considering America is known as the cultural mixing pot of the planet, the outrage is hilarious.
I knew this was going to happen as soon as that second verse began. 
Also a lot of ignorant comments on Coke's Facebook page.

WTF is wrong with some people? They just look for a reason to get butt hurt, don't they.
Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:
I lift my lamp beside the golden door. 
I don't know if a Native American language was featured during this song, but it's always fun to point out that [North America has more linguistic diversity than Europe,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Langs_N.Amer.png) especially when confronted with the ignorance of the 'speak english, dag nammit!' crowd.
I think that the people getting mad are missing the point. You've got people from all over the world, speaking all kinds of languages, singing about how awesome America is. Sounds pretty patriotic to me.
so unamerican they should be ashamed...and i dont mean coke
They just need to put sugar back in.  Coke tastes so much better outside the US.
So I watched the commercial. Unlike many others though I have a giant change of heart and feel pride in my country. We came from so many different parts of the world. So many people still come to us for immigration and asylum from their terrible home countries. Have people forgotten what we stand for? 

The USA was made by immigrants. I personally feel that coca cola did the best in showcasing what we are about. We are about freedom. We dont care where you come from. We do not care what language you speak. The american dream for many is still alive and it is heard throughout the world. For many people america is there dream land. 

To the people on twitter complaining. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
What happened to the polar bears?!
Even fox news was calling this outrage ridiculous this morning. 
was actually one of the first times i honestly enjoyed hearing that song. i thought it was beautiful.
America the land of immigrants is a FACT. Even our forefathers were IMMIGRANTS. 
I see these twitter outrages after every major event. There are racist and spoiled kids in the world, and they have access to twitter just like everyone else. Even if you find 100 of these, it literally says nothing about the general population of even a state. 
I interpreted the commercial to be an extension or continuation of their old jingle, "I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.  I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company".
Ah yes apparently living in America and knowing more than the english language is an insult to the country how dare people know more than one language who do they think they are?

Its obvious that Americans should only ever speak english at all times and companies should never acknowledge diversity within a country created by  immigrants, 
As a (small) foreign investor in US stocks, I am happy to see this ad.
The only "weapon" to best the Chinese is diversity, if not, prepare to be owned.
But hey, US is a free country, at least you have Pepsi, right?

edit: typo
Is it weird that I took the commercial like other country's were singing America the beautiful? As if we (Americans) were trying to have other countries and groups sing the song? I didn't see it as people in the US singing it in different languages. 
"If I wanted to see Coke ads in foreign, I'd move to Uzbekibekistanstan!"

Stupidest outrage ever then. In fact, reading about an alleged Twitter outrage on reddit, about a commercial I haven't seen during a game I didn't watch on cable TV that I don't subscribe to... that's pretty much the definition of what an outrage is not. I'm not even drinking any Coke unless it's the Mexican product in glass bottles, and I don't have a Twitter account either.... Oh god, I'm either a hipster or an old fart. It's a fine line.
i didnt like that commercial. I just thought it was cheesey. Its something that I wouldnt want to watch again. Most of those Commercials sucked. Im upset Stephen Colbert didnt pull through. 
This fucking baffles me, why the hell is everyone upset about this?!
Dude, America is built upon multi-cultured people. We wouldn't be the greatest country in the world if it weren't for some of their contributions. I would be honored to be able to sing that song in as many languages as I could, we should be humbled as a country that we impact as much of the world as we do. 
Every single one of those people offended by that commercial will continue to consume Coca-Cola products.
They aren't foreigners they are all Americans...they just speak the languages of the countries they came from-despite our differences we are all Americans...American is beautiful-all of us kind of idea

You gave it your best shot, Coca-Cola. I thought it was a nice message, even if it didn't make me thirsty for Coke.
Beautiful people, beautiful song, beautiful country...  I just don't get it.
Coca Cola, thank you...
According to Orwell, what will happen to any democratic society if clarity in language collapses? He predicts that the society itself will collapse. Bad use of language makes it easy for us to have foolish and absolutely incorrect ideas. Distorted language can distort us, corrupt us and make us so stupid we won't know lies when we hear them. We won't question our leaders. We won't have the language tools to enable us to speak the truth. Turn on the major media TV news and listen to the politicians twisting truth into something unrecognizable. And when any country starts to have a multiple language with large populations already incapable of communicating with each other and often times that language barrier is errected with fear and hatered for the other side. The same path of control through language manipulation occurs BUT with the added benefit that the rulers will have two or more groups that can be played against each other for even more control by the goverment. Pay close attention to the debate between people who want a multi-language country and the people who want a single language country in both cases the central rallying cry is that of  fear and more importantly in both cases these groups are calling on government to assume more control over their lives. Orwell was right to warn us and that we as a people ignore him at our peril.  
Aren't we supposed to be the melting pot? Isn't it a compliment that people want to come here so bad that they can't wait to sing this country's praises so before learning English they sing it their first language? 

Sounds like, "Hey I love your country so much and love being here so much I want to sing about it but in my language so that it really means something to me."
Granted it's a corporate ad, but the Wingnuts who got their jimmies in a rustle are missing the point. Aren't they supposed to be all about love of country? Wouldn't the very definition of what they harp on ad nauseum, that 'Murica is the greatest country on earth, foreign people who agree with them coming here and singing their hearts out about it? Did their lilly white ancestors stop speaking Polish/German/Czech/Russian/Yiddish the moment their feet hit Ellis Island? Doubtful. 

Welcome to America. Navajo is a original language. English came from jolly ol' England. Who we kicked out... Go back there if you're a racist 
Dem terrorist was takin over mah diahbeetus juice.
The day the media are able to spot obvious trolls is the day headlines like these will disappear for good. 
 Isn't America rooted in the fundamental belief of diversity? 
I thought the ad was wonderful! It showed the true American spirit.
After seeing everyone get pissed at the Spurs for having the little mariachi singing I knew there was going to be backlash over that commercial
I thought it was a beautiful version of the song, well edited together.
It bothered me it wasn't in English not because of prejudice but because it's not how the song was originally crafted for other languages as far as choosing words for rhyming schemes.  It's like trying to listen to Rammstin not in German.  Overall I was actually surprised how well the other languages worked really well with in the song  
Everything is an outrage on twitter. It would be funny if it wasn't so pathetically sad
Ugh, can the media stop with this "sparks outrage on twitter" nonsense that always pops up.

There's always going to be a bunch of trolls yelling and bitching about something no matter what, I don't know if it amounts to mass "outrage"
People are only outraged on Twitter? That seems very strange.
I don't get why people were able to get offended at this commercial. Coke is showing that where ever you are in the world, drinking Coca Cola is supporting America. At least that's what I got out of it. 

Plus, aside from a couple commercials that made me laugh this one was easily the best. 
Conspiracy theory: Coca-Cola started a fake twitter outraged at the commercial's usage of multiple languages. They know people will be outraged and like McDonald's "Freedom Fries" they know American people are dumb enough to buy coca-cola related products in protest and talk about how they're true patriots. 
The only thing I found offensive about the Coca-Cola and Cheerios' ads were how bland and uninteresting they were.  

The Cheerios' ad was just awkward because it didn't seem like a normal family situation where a kid is told about a new sibling, the awkward dialog was drawn out for no reason, and it really had nothing to do with the product.

The song used in the Coke commercials has been reworked numerous times over the years, I've heard it with different lyrics for different countries my whole life.  The commercial was just boring and I didn't get the urge to even look at a Coke to wash down the wings I was eating at the time.
What DOESN'T spark outrage on twitter these days?
Are the dramawhores at E Online sure some of those people weren't being sarcastic? And if not, no shit that out of millions of twitter users some of them are racist/ignorant/bigoted/whatever. Giving them attention and/or starting a shame brigade isn't going to change anyone's worldview for the better, even if they get run off of Twitter. Such a thing is as petty as their twitter posts.
If anything bothers me about this ad, is that it seems to be only focused on the diversity around Hispanic culture. Also America the Beautiful being sung in spanish was kind of messed up, it's not like the Hispanic people are the only population that immigrate to America. I sort of feel like this ad would be more at home at a political convention, rather than the Super Bowl.
Funny thing is, no one complained about the cheerios commercial. Some joker from MSNBC opined on twitter that conservatives wouldn't like it. That's all there was to it.
I thought my family (who are 2nd generation German immigrants) were going to come unglued when this was on.Made cracks like American the Beautiful shold be in American. I pissed them off when I asked Cheyenne or Apache? Which are two most common tribes where we live. Glares,dead silence. It's all relative,eh?
They have to.   White people don't drink enough of that overpriced sugar water to keep them afloat.
Not sure if this was shared yet,  but a news anchor by the name of Brenda Wood had a great [response](http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhTET8n4zG1Ro8ld9L) to those "outraged" by the commercial.



how about we stop pretending America is so great. We have major issues, and bombing kids with drones still...
Twitter just brought out all the typical racists, bigots and xenophobes.  There is nothing offensive in that ad.  
A lot of Americans seem to get butthurt when they realise that there are other countries on this planet that are equally great. "SING IT IN ENGLISH; 'MURICA BEST COUNTRY!HURR DURR"
Those weren't "real Americans". You know the racist dick wads that want to the world to go back to 1955. Those are "Real Americans". /s
The song was sung beautifully. Anyone who takes offense to that commercial in any way, I believe is the epitome of what's wrong with America. 
[removed]
There is no patriotism in the United States any more, only jingoism of varying degrees.
Can we say that all the ads this year seemed to be very inclusive and diverse?
I honestly feel dumber having read this thread, I need to go lay down my head hurts.
Once again, people react to something that matters so little while the big things go unquestioned. 
I immediately knew this ad would piss off some people. I just hope Coke's business will stay afloat after alienating the obese redneck demographic. 

Then again, these people probably think that switching to Dr. Pepper constitutes a boycott. Coke will be fine. 
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she

With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

In all fairness, it was a pretty bad commercial 
America doesn't have an official language. We're a country of immigrants from lands where the person speak different languages. Is it bad that those people want to sing America the Beautiful? 
Sometimes I hate that science has (mostly through govt electrification of rural areas), allowed the dumbest among us to speak their minds about every little thing.
What bothers me most about this is that the people that are whining about this are still going to go out and buy coke products. That and the fact that English borrows from so many other languages that it seems stupid to me to whine about this.
This reeks of false controversy stirred up by Coca-cola. Its perfect. Air a commercial that no rational person would take offence to, then start a fake twitter war (#speakamerican) against the ad. Then every rational person in America gets to jump to Cokes defence, "this *is* what America is all about! fuck off bigots #americaisbeautiful".

Dont you see? **Now Coca-cola owns multiculturalism.** You think of multiculturalism in America, you think of Coke. You argue with bigots on the internet, and you use Coca-colas hashtag to do it.

Its genius.
The only outrageous thing about this commercial was the exclusion of Native Americans. 
I thought it would've been a better commercial if they sang it in English with all the different accents people have. It showed how culturally diverse the US is, but only showed we are united through a soft drink. All the different languages made it seem like we have huge language barriers. 
God America is ful of idiotic bigots.  I pray other countries will treat us well when we're no longer dominant 
What, we aren't allowed to sing America the Beautiful anymore?
De jure, the USA do not have an official language, therefore, all of those SpeakMurican idiots can fuck right off. If, in 50 years, the majority of people in America will speak spanish as their native language, so be it.
Call me an asshole.

but I think if you want to be an American citizen you should speak english.
Multiculturalism shoved down our throats. Horray! Even the people on the youtube comments are getting BTFO by people like me.
It was not the diversity that I found offensive. I like how diverse ourr country is. But I want us all to speak the same language, so we can communicate with each other day to day and on important topics, the country needs to deal with. The commercial did celebrate diversity but I think it celebrated not learning English which I think is not good for our country.
I am an Arab Muslim that lives in the USA, and to be honest Americans have every right to be pissed, language is a huge part of a countries culture, so do not try to take that away from anybody, I understand that America is a diverse-cultural country, but still the language here is English, not just English, it is American English.
I personally cringed at the hamfisted effort at being overtly diverse for no other reason than being such. Kinda a, "look guise, I'm so not racist cause I surround my self with all these different skin colors because I want to prove how not racist I am."

 I suspect however this was a pr stunt for either leftists, or various parts of the 3rd world that watched the super bowl. Seeing as coca cola has been accused of some serious fuckery lately. 
I've been trying to bring it to the attention of the people me the idea of propaganda and it being used on us... saying in such a way the average american can associate the meaning with and destroy the gut reaction to imediatealy poo poo something that's not in sync with your reality.. that's the trick. A lot of people say it in a lot of different ways i've noticed, just gotta listen and watch intelligence lies in subtelty in this society, their not jsut going to stick thier neck out but a motivated community could conquer the mass regime change it's different now, we need help over here i'm right by d.c. 

People in other countries that recognize propoganda and hate it what common ties or words do you use to draw your conclusions to unify the thoughts? 
[...in the early 1700s, all through the 1800s, and into the early 20th century, German was the second most widely spoken language in the United States after English.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language_in_the_United_States#History)

[The music for America the Beautiful was taken from the song 'O Mother dear, Jerusalem' written by a Scotsman.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dickson_(minister\))

[Some describe the author of the lyrics to 'America, the Beautiful' as a lesbian.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Lee_Bates)

'America, the Beautiful' was penned in 1893.

'Murka.
I guess people get a little annoyed when 50% of the actors who act in most modern commercials only make up about 15% of the nation...
I don't know, hearing the US National Anthem sung in another language was jarring, at first. But then I thought, "How fitting." We don't have an official language, did you know that? 

If hearing the US national anthem sung in another language pisses you off, consider: They're seeing the US NATIONAL ANTHEM, not some other national anthem while living in the US. See the difference? Come one, come all, make us stronger and better. 'Murica!
It's good that America is finally admitting we're a world wide empire.  It's nice seeing all those subject people's singing our songs.
If you're not feeling manipulated, you're not paying attention.
I thought it was hilarious that Coca-Cola paid foreigners to sing a song about how great America is in their native languages. Fuck yeah.
Patriotism IS corporate marketing.
Well Americans are used to companies hijacking patriotism for money.

But goddamn foreigners not speaking 'merican. 
It's even funnier how so many of the "SPEAK ENGLISH" comments completely butcher the language. It's as if they'd had such a hard time with the language they were raised with that the thought of having to learn another terrifies them. 
Also hijacking supposed outrage to keep people saying the words "Coca Cola" for a few months.

"Hey Remember when those news articles posted pictures of 3 or 4 (out of 937.2 million) people who may or may not live in the US that were mad about them speaking other languages in that Coke commercial?


...This fucking country........."
Yours is the most poignant comment here.
It was subtly offensive for sure. Imagine watching a revered German Opera being sung in Italian or vice versa. 

It's not that being inclusive of our immigrants is what is offensive here, it's not. But rather the fact that the one of the most revered song in our culture has been hijacked to further an agenda that multilingual country is what is desirable, or that it is even beautiful. 

Regardless of the origins of the Americans, we have found many common grounds to unite ourselves,m and one of such is our language. A song was written in that language and has been sung and revered by many generations of Americans. 

By putting foreign languages to that unified identity, what they have done is to divide us along the linguistic lines, and made a statement that it is ok to be divided and unity among Americans is no longer desirable, when the strength of America derives itself from our unwavering unity. Divided America is not a strong America. It is one of division and strife along ethnic and racial lines. 

One thing of a few things that unites us is our language. 


edit i word. 
You'd have to be a true idiot to get mad at a commercial for a beverage.
On the other hand, anyone who got mad because the commercial was so mind-numbingly saccharine and used nationalism for a cheap pop is, in my opinion, well within their rights to do so.
Sigh. To get pissed off at this commercial and the biracial mom/dad cheerios commercial, you have to be a pretty big asshole. It's gotta be like 80% conservative dickholes.
I find it funny that there is a good chance that the same idiots don't even know all the words to the song. Like it would have made a difference if they heard it in English or not. Typical.
"People" get mad at everything on Twitter.

Media chooses to cover it if it tells a narrative.

Everyone acting outraged in this thread is consuming.

I absolutely think they write these articles before then fill in the blanks marked X with the inevitable angry tweets.

Watching the Super Bowl from overseas, I got a propaganda vibe from more than a few of those ads..
But what's more American than America?!
The Budweiser one where the soldier got a welcome home parade annoyed me. I'd rather he get real medical attention instead of a pat on the back.
Sounds like SOMEONE doesn't like freedom!
I agree. So many tributes to loved ones over seas... How about bringing them home so they can be with their loved ones?
Yeah, the Olympics are next week. That has a lot to do with it.  
Watching Super Bowl from another country is like watching propaganda for american people. Sad but true. A lot of these ads where just like "hurr durr, 'murica." Propaganda bullshit. I'm sorry for you guys over there. You get brainwashed too much.
There is no such thing...
We need to remind our citizens that our country is something to be loved. 
Yes.

Don't look it up to verify that.
Still doesn't even have real sugar in it either. Sigh
didn't happen:

OMG, wtf is wrong with you, purple and green ketchups exist, don't get so lost in our *VIOLENT* culture that all you want to *see* is shades of **RED**  #ketchup=/=violence

on edit:  Doh, someone beat me to it.
Funny how much we revere Greek and Latin.  It isn't that we hate Spanish, its that we hate being associated with Mexico.

Classism takes many forms, nationalism and racism included.
3) I believe you're thinking of "My Country 'Tis of Thee".  
In basically every first and second world country in the world you're free to speak any language you want, in fact, one may argue that many of those places are freer anyway.
I wish it was our national anthem. Also, this country was supposed to be multilingual. That is why congress added new mexico as a state with its official constitution in both Spanish and English. Also, Louisiana was intended to be a French speaking state.   This was supposed to be a free country, now free country is something we say to make ourselves feel better. 
[This is our national language.](http://i.imgur.com/jSDDyCy.jpg) It doesn't matter what language you squeeze out of your neck. The only things that matter are the numbers you squeeze out of your wallet.
Linguistic superiority complexes are some of the most ridiculous things.  The US's lack of multiple linguistic skills among the population at large is actually a huge economic and social problem.
Did he also get pissed about the interracial cheerios commercial? 
The point he's probably trying to make is this push away from national unity. It's one thing to be a multi-cultural country with it's identity firmly in anglo-saxon laws and principles (as this country was founded ). It's another thing entirely to start promoting a mindset where no one needs to assimilate to the greater American culture and simple exist in their own ethnic bubbles.

It's not just an American thing either, most, if not all countries tend to view people who simply won't assimilate to their culture with disdain. This commercial, ever so subtly invokes that anger with a 'speak whatever language you like, people born and raised on the streets around you will have to take it upon themselves to accept and understand you' mentality. 


Whenever I hear something like that I tell people they should just speak the official language of the U.S., then I ask if they know what the official language of the U.S. is, and we have a nice little conversation.
Your friend does know that there is no national language in America, right? There is no reason that anything "should be in English" solely.
>with a friend of mine

Well there's your problem.
I was mostly just confused. The featured places looked like their respective countries to me. I felt bad that they were all stuck singing that song because I thought they were from those countries. "Why is an [insert nationality here] singing America the Beautiful for a coke commercial if they are representing said nationality." Since coke is an international brand I figured it was an international commercial and America the Beautiful would therfore be a stupid song choice. 
There was. I think it was a second generation Indian girl who was singing it so she might have had a bit of an American accent. 
Maybe one of the state languages?
Yeah, there was, Hindi or Urdu.
Languages sung: English, Tagalog, Spanish, Hebrew, Hindi, Keres, & Senegalese-French
It sounded like 2nd generation kids singing... The Filipino part also sounded like and American trying to sing in Tagalog, but hey, that's coz it was!

I think it makes the outrage all the more sadder, since these are American kids born to immigrant parents singing. Yet somehow, they are not American enough for some people. 
I think the butchering was intentional because it closely represents how American kids born to immigrant parents sound. The kids can definitely understand the parents, but when speaking back, butchering ensues. 
RIGHT?

Why the fuck would anyone get mad about this?! And personally I thought it sounded cool.
Agreed.  People make me sad
Yea because some people were upset by a commercial by appreciation for this country has declined. 

You're an idiot. 
What's there to be mad about?
I did as well.

When I stopped understanding what they where saying I thought "Oh boy, I could already hear people angry," then I had a bit of hope and continued the thought."But I'm sure people are much more understanding these days."

*Nope*
Its funny reading the ones about how the people need to learn english to be american while having poor grammar. 
Not just facebook, look at the comments here quite sad all around.
Yup.. tis the trend of the decade. Quite sad, really. 
You just described like 90% of reddit posters and commenters.
Some choice examples:

"Want buy coke or it other products that was a disgrace to America our fore father came her learned English 


Coke is a done business in America. You made the worse business decision to make and produce the ads you ran.


America Should be sung only IN ENGLISH this has upset me


You guys made two of the biggest mistakes in history.. 1- vanilla coke, 2- sing in America the beautiful in Spanglish..


Your fired


i drank my last coke b4 the superbowl, now i wil drink water, coke is anti america


Ummmmmmmm.....were English speaking North Americans! 


I am now a Pepsi drinker, By koolaid and coke.


ITS AMERICA ....speak ENGLISH OR GET OUT!


Very Sad on cokes part"
Exactly this. It reminded me of a quote a Chinese friend of mine once said:

>"The American dream isn't exclusive to Americans. No. The American dream is a world wide dream. One of living in a land where you are free from the oppression you have faced your entire life. Where you are free to be who you want, what you want, and to do so whenever you desire. That is the real American dream, and it is not exclusive to any one nation."

I know the ad was cheesy, and I know it was meant to pull at the heart strings. But to me, it reminded me of my friend in China, working to make her country into a better place. And it made me miss her.
What they need to do is put the COKE back in coca cola. 
Where I live you can get real sugar Coke all over the place. It's all imported from Mexico, which never stops being funny to me.
Canadian who recently travelled to America. Can confirm American soda tastes like ass compared to Canada. 
One drowned and the other one is hopped up on drugs in a zoo. 
I think the first two fish were born in Africa.  
Besides Alexander Hamilton, that's simply not true. Most of the founding fathers were born here and so were their relatives. Most of them came from what we call "upper middle class" families and their families have been in the states since the 1600s. 

I understand the fact that North America was settled by other people of different cultures and languages, but it's a bit overboard to say our founding fathers were all immigrants from another land, when in fact they weren't. 
We've always treated immigrants like shit though. That is a fact.
>Even our forefathers were IMMIGRANTS.

...except *my* forefathers. Native American here. We were migrants, not immigrants. Im. So sad.
whoa there buddy, "immigrants" is a dirty word.  You want to start getting into what these folks are really thinking....

many of these locos will trace lineage back to civil and revolutionary war.  That makes them patriots.  Immigrants were greasy folks looking for work.  Most of the people who bitch the loudest wouldn't even admit to that, they all want to believe they are special snowflakes whose fathers were important to the nation.

So follows much of the "catch" phrases that the KKK and other white supremacist movements use in recruiting.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't have a common language or culture.
Exactly. This was a more narrowly targeted version of that. What people aren't getting is that this is a good commercial not because we want coke making our ideological decisions for us, but because coke now thinks this ideology of multicultural diversity will sell. An ad like this is designed top be on the right side of history and to get people, particularly young people, to associate coke with"modern" thinking.
Even my dad, who isn't great with symbolism, saw that in the commercial.
if people realized that speaking spanish meant almost never having to wait at court or the DMV, they might change their tune....



nah.... wtf was i thinking?


> The only "weapon" to best the Chinese is diversity, if not, prepare to be owned. 

How?  I don't mind the ad but your point seems absurd.  Most of our issues with China has to do with its ability to what is very close to slave labor, no environmental controls, state ownership of economic production which allows for all sorts of bad capitalist behaviors, and violations of international copyrights left and right.




Unfortunately for them, not even pepsi look at whose pepsico CEO, and all branches of pepsico and coca-cola. 
Becky and Stan love Coke.


I just perked up when she asked for a puppy and thought, "yup smart girl." Didn't think anything else of the commercial. 
Yeah, he pulled apart!

In my opinion, Orwell got it wrong. Huxley is the one who correctly predicted the future of America. Our government isn't controlling us with fear they are controlling us with entertainment. Orwell told of a time where books were burned, Huxley told of a time where instead, no one wanted to pick up a book in the first place. Which direction would you say we are going in? 
I'm convinced that anyone who holds such a xenophobic belief has never lived in any other country that's not basically a clone of American life.

Melting pot was the speel we were given in the 90s. It's since been revised to "tossed salad" or something to reflect we're a mixed bag of cultures rather than a homogenous goop of culture.
Fantastic comment!  
it is.  but  the vast majority who support it arent loud about it.
Yes, we want diversity so long as the newcomers turn white once they get here. /s
That's what they'd like you to think but in reality the answer is no
this. though remaking that would probably go over well...
..Pretty sure one of the verse was in Keres or something very similar

I think if citizens of the world were to sing America the Beautiful, it would be inspiring and overall pretty damn cool.
You can sing, but don't forget your flag pin, creationist school textbook, and 9/11 never forget crying eagle poster.

Also, don't use any of them fancy words neither.

You do know to be a naturalized American citizen one *does* have to [speak English](http://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test), right?  And naturalized citizens also tend to know more about [American history and civics](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/04/30/study-one-in-three-americans-fails-naturalization-civics-test) than most native born Americans.

So, I don't think you're an asshole.  But I do think you might be misinformed.
Well I'm glad you're not in charge of that decision. 
i love being places where you lots of different languages and see people dressed in different ways.  if we were all the same it would be a little boring.
> Call me an asshole.

OK, asshole.
Because you do?
Why? English was brought here by immigrants just like almost every other language spoken in America.
It's very fortunate that other countries don't have this racist idea.  I would never have been able to leave the USA permanently otherwise.  I receive my EU citizenship this year, and feel very fortunate for it, I can finally give up my US one if I wish without being stateless.

In fact, my time in both Austria and Uruguay has been awesome primarily because they welcomed me, and my English, with open arms.  Though I'm happy to pick up Spanish, and have done so fairly well, it would have been a horrible 3 years if people treated me like a second class person when I spoke English.
Prepare to get downvoted by the Liberal Dipshits who have taken over Reddit. Nationalism is a concept that is alien to their minds. One even called it [racism](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1wv4rw/cocacolas_america_the_beautiful_super_bowl/cf5pu5c).

A national language and culture are vital for the stability of any country. Look at the Civil War. Cultural differences almost split our country in half.

Or look at the Bosnian War for a more recent example of why you are right.
> I think it celebrated not learning English  
  
How does the mere *existence* of languages other than English "celebrate not learning English"?  We have no national language.  The outrage from the right on this just proves that even when conservatives can't find anything to shit their pants in rage over, they'll make something up.  Useless creatures.


how often do you really have a problem with a language barrier in the USA?  i live in Ariozna and dont speak spanish and i never have a problem.  in a few years we'll all have translators anyway...
So you're a backwards and ignorant Arab Muslim living in the USA. Good to know.
>I suspect however this was a pr stunt for either leftists, or various parts of the 3rd world

Yes, us leftists are big supporters of Coca Cola, Inc. 

Obviously, it was a conspiracy of some sort to undermine America.

lol
take off the tin foil hat...
Coke was marketing to the world with that commercial
They make up key market demographics companies want to target.  That's how capitalism works.  
"America the Beautiful" is not the [national anthem of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner).
i felt manipulated and it felt good.
I find it hilarious you're assuming they're foreign. Americans speak a ton of languages. I'm Italian-American,and speak English, Spanish, Japanese, and know some yiddish, arabic, barese (Italian dialecect), and farsi. 
If English was good enough for Jesus then it's good enough for me!

Ahhhh, I remember the good ole days when saying " 'merican" was still funny.

Gods below! life has done you a great disservice by allowing you to get to the age you can use the internet and also believe xenophobia thinly veiled as nationalism makes your country 'strong'. 

You are in sore need of a history lesson if you think that persecuting those who are different to your ideal view of your country makes your country stronger. The realty is that when enough people join in in your mentality it never ends well. The exact opposite occurs. Fragmentation of cultural groups, persecution of a minority or civil war is what you have to look forward to if your view becomes popular enough. 

I would explain why embracing those who are different to you actually makes your country stronger but i feel id be wasting time better spent on other things, like banging my head on my desk knowing people like you exist.
I'm sorry, but when I was last over in the us, literally every damn advert had something to do with patriotism or freedom. One of the worst was an advert for a cane called the 'freedom' edition. It was a fucking walking stick, and thy were touting it as though it were some sort wonderful product that all true Americans could get behind because it had a veteran walking with it in the ad. If anything, outrage over any song being sung in other languages, of which many people in the us speak, is more offensive to those that speak it and live in the us, than the song being sung in the first place.

Edit: stop with the 'unity' stuff, you really come across as one of those crazy people that 'Merica is poking fun at.

Gimmie a break. The Olympics start next week.
Who says "pop?"  Speak English, dammit!  It's "Coke!"  "Coca-cola" if you're feeling fancy.

True story: I was chatting with a coworker last week about how the next Democratic candidate for President needs to be an Arab lesbian atheist who got thrown out of ACORN for being too liberal.  It would help if she had tattoos.

It was all really all my friends putting up fake tweets #GodDamnAmerica #Pepsi4Life #faketweets
You know what, if the media wants to overblow a story to expose peoples' racism or ignorance, I'm ok with it.
If you're deployed, get home safe. If you're free, help to dispel the propaganda.

If you're inclined stop drinking the soda.
Because that's exactly what it is, propaganda.
It probably doesn't mean anything but I find the [**2nd and 3rd line items on this page**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nsa%20super%20bowl+site:www.youtube.com&kl=us-en&kl=us-en) are telling....of something.
dude that's exactly what I was thinking. hmm no commercials condoning the support of psychological treatment of soldiers, or soldiers with missing limbs, brain damage, etc. but let's give this one soldier a huge party and two tickets to the super bowl. every veteran should have gotten a ticket by that standard.
[I preferred Steel Reserve's vet-themed commercial anyway](http://www.duffelblog.com/2014/02/super-bowl-ads/)
You're assuming. Who's to say he didn't. It's an ad showing the happy side, not his PTSD testing...
or you know, not a pay cut, not a benefits cut, and some real jobs programs.... 

instead of hero worship on the tele.
and all I see today on facebook are people saying " I wish all vets had a homecoming like this!" Well I wish they weren't going over there to be mercenaries, and instead stayed home with their families
Better export some to their country using freedom drones.

They are reminded every day. Children in school have to stand up and pledge allegiance to the flag. Every gas station I drive by has an American flag outside. Every single politician ends every single speech by saying America is the greatest place on earth. How much more reminding do we need?
I fully agree; however, it's not as easy now that our government has given America a good slam fucking. Nobody wants damaged goods. 
The natural world of the US is something to be loved, not so sure the human side is.
oh corn, what can't  you do?


It does if you buy the Mexican stuff in glass bottles.
Because fructose is a fake sugar?
I dont know where you went to school but Greek and Latin were just as neglected as modern foreign languages in my school district. We had 1 option, Spanish.
...the actual name of the song is "America," which, as OP states, was based off the British national anthem "God Save the Queen," - same melody, different words.


edit: just watched the commercial. it is indeed 'america the beautiful,' which is a different song from 'america,' so he/she got that part wrong. everything else he/I said is still true, tho.

edit 2: being downvoted for being right, i see. cool.
FWIW.  There are not very many established nations who do not have an "official language."  The US, UK and Australia are examples; and I believe some South American countries also have no official language.  Most major nations have "official" languages.
At the time of the founding there were vast swathes of the interior where the dominant language was German, not English. The second Continental Congress considered issuing an official German language version of the Declaration for those people.
Do you have a source for the Louisiana fact? I'm curious to learn more and cannot find it with a quick Google search. 

You're absolutely correct that the history of language in this country is more complicated than these fools would want to believe.
Doesn't have to be that way.


a spiral staircase for tiny strippers...  and bankers, of course.
That's why we pay people to speak other languages for us. It's capitalism. 
I am curious what these problems are. Do you have any links to read up on the economic and social impact?
Agreed. Most of the hateful tweets contained **serious** "grammatical" and "syntax" errors like fundamental confusions of "their" with "they are".
No, it isn't. Pretty fucking ironic you're complaining about 'Linguistic superiority complexes' and then proceed to look down your nose at the US using language as an excuse. Grow some self-awareness.

Actually, a common denominator in the ability to have multiple races and cultures living together is the need for them to be able to communicate with each other.  It requires at least one lingua franca for the country to optimally operate.  How can you interact with people on the most basic level if you can't speak?
Language is one of the cultural bonds of a nation, creates a high trust society, and prevents balkanization.  With no common language and no common culture what holds a nation together?
Sometimes adult relationships can be complex. 
Before coming to America, that was the general perception about Americans - that they are racist, rude and unwelcoming. But once I was here, the warm welcome I had received and the way Americans treated me, I was amazed at how welcoming they are. I never had experienced such politeness and warmth even in India. It appeared to me that Americans value humanity more than we Indians do. But then again, from time to time, controversies like this one surface and makes me wonder whether what I'm experiencing in this town is just a regional thing.
I got teary-eyed with awws! (I know commercialism etc. but America the Beautiful gets me every time.
Why? Because...'Murica. I can imagine the shit I'm going to listen to today when I go into my office full of ethnocentric retards. 
I thought the commercial was fucking stupid, but that was just because it was so contrived and I'm tired of the propaganda.  I don't really care that people translated America the Beautiful.
try animals then
My appreciation for the nation hasn't declined, but my optimism about my neighbors sure has.

The saddest part is that they wouldn't understand if you pointed that issue out to them.  

I once asked an acquaintance with notoriously poor grammar about this very issue.  His reply?  "It doesn't matter how you write it, just that you speak it right."  

I then pointed out that he wasn't always grammatically correct in his speech, either.  He stormed off and didn't speak to me for several days.  

I was not very upset over this turn of events.
for both sides
not until we sort the cartels.
yeah buddy. then we can all be as fun as Pam from Archer.
Yeah, can get Mexican Coke in Texas at the grocery even.  But still never see it in restaurants.  Jason's Deli had Dublin Dr. Pepper for awhile.
To be fair, it's not only the soda. It's the chips and candy as well. Being from Mexico the chips in the US are so dull. It tastes like they have very little flavoring.

Not likely. The world has tolerated much worse governments than the US and has accepted those countries after the zenith of their power. Nazi Germany, The U.K., the USSR are just a few examples. As many mistakes and horrible deeds that the US has and continues to do today, relative to past empires, the U.S. is not any worse and the argument could be made ( I am not suggesting that I would make this argument) that we are somewhat more benevolent or at least better intentioned.
i like the coke commercial. I only drink Mexican Coke though, the stuff they pedal here in the states doesn't have the real sugar and tastes like shit.
It would be kind of dumb.  The reaction would be a bunch of people with a 'MERKA! boners

A nation has to have a an official language to be unified.
Then why don't we revert back to one of the many languages the natives spoke?
Look at the world. Most nations have a language that is spoken by the majority of the population. This is especially true for the countries that have the highest standard of living, the best education, the strongest economies. A uniform language goes a vast distance towards making a country strong.
You do realize that it's been over 150 years since the Civil War, right? And we're still here?
I have it quite often. As An assistant Principal of a middle school communication with some parents is hard. We sometimes are using the child to do the translation. I have used google translate and it seems to get the point across.

But my point is bigger then our ability to communicate in minor situations but rather in public debate and discourse. Our political debates are in english, when politicians are interviewed its in english, emergency procedures when there is a snowstorm, tornado or some other emergency are in english. I just believe we will be a closer people if we had a common language.
I'm going to try to be polite responding to your comment,  although I don't have to.
I thought everyone is entitled to an opinion, or maybe I just don't understand the concept
 of "freedom", you know being so backwards and stuff. 

..... Read that again. You clearly didn't comprehend what I was saying. 

You then admit that leftists aren't fans of coca cola. Well, I wonder what might change that? I dunno, how about ad campaigns geared towards their values? Might be beneficial to have them have a favorable view of coke, seing as they're the ones most likely to cry foul over their dealings. 
You'll just never get off that island, will you?
The intent of the commercial was to portray foreigners singing America the Beautiful. That's the funny part. But thanks for taking the opportunity to brag about yourself, that was really useful and contributed to the comment *immensely*.
*English?* I'm not from England, you turbin wearin terrorist. We speak **American** in this Country.

i remember some muriclap was laughing when EU introduced 25 official languages. enjoy new world you created at home guys.
I'm not. I was born in America and live in America. 

I'd also gladly speak whatever language I want, if I knew more than English, and of course I'd still be American. 
It gets pedantic eventually even as someone of Native American descent.  Get picky enough and all humans not living south of the Sahara are "foreigners".
I'm not a foreigner. Thanks though. 
Yes you have. 
nicely rebutted
They could've called for unity in many other ways. 

Look at Europe. How is it divided? Along the language lines. Could you possibly deny that? Sure, in the border region, there are spillover and mixing of languages, but predominantly, Europe is divided along the languages. 

Yes, these languages exist in the US as we're a nation of immigrants. But we're a nation of immigrants **united** in one language along with a few other traits. And the immigrants who speak English well are far more likely to succeed than those who do not. (although this probably is due to the level of education they already have)

This commercial hijacked one of the most revered songs in our history and 
pissed all over it. 

This would've been a fantastic commercial if they featured all of the participants exactly the same, except all singing in English, perhaps even with heavy accents. Actually heavy accents would've been far far more powerful.

**What?!?!**  They prefer to be called african-american thank you very much.
> Who says "pop?"

Oh, about [half the country](http://popvssoda.com:2998/countystats/total-county.html).  Funny thing is, I didn't say "cheap pop" meaning an inexpensive soda.  I meant it in the same sense as when, say, comedians doing a routine play up the city they're in.  "I love [local city]! Y'all are much better than [nearby rival city]."
It's Pop not soda. 

I've been arguing this with my nephew, from New England for years.

Saccharine, in the context I used it, means something that's cloyingly sweet or sentimental.  It's a great word for precisely this sort of thing.
Yeah I was just referring to the people involved in the social media "uproar", who felt the need to protest these commercials in any way. There will always be those kinds of folks on social media though, saying and doing much worse stuff than that.
True. But, the correlation is high enough that the occasional outlier is only: "this guy on the internet claims to know a racist liberal".
You underestimate how many young idiots/racists there are out there. It's not all old folk.

Just look at reddit...
27 years old. Female. It's not something worth spewing about on twitter but I definitely rolled my eyes at the commercial.
Yep, their opinions are wrong and we should wish death on them because of it.
Old farts sure use twitter regularly. These were very dumb young folks. Teenagers to 30 year olds I bet
Yeah, I'm sure *that's* the part that caused the "controversy". 

There really were tons of news stories about the commercial's interracial couple, when it first aired. As if it was some kind of big deal. In 2013 when it was released, which is just sad. Can't we just ignore it like most of the commercials we see...if we're not fast forwarding through them?
Then you have to also be ok media overblowing stories that you don't support.

And also be ok with racists having free speech on Twitter.

I'm ok with all of these things, I just don't know if stories like "4 or 5 people on Twitter complained about something!!" should be on this sub.


yeah, I hear it's really bad for your teeth.
I think I would have been livid if I was that soldier.  My return to my family hijacked to make a commercial.  I would rather not have a parade than have one under those circumstances.
Holy shit... got a link to the actual commercial?
Could we maybe have some of that freedom back?  I think we're causing a domestic shortage./
Frones for everyone!

See still massive veteran benefits bureaucratic backlog for the answer to that question.
I really didn't get that vibe from the commercial at all. It was more, "hey our troops deserve to be appreciated, and were trying to do that. And here's our name because we payed a shit ton of money for this commercial and we want you to have a positive opinion. To me, it really doesn't matter if they only did the whole parade so they could make the commercial. Regardless of their motive, they still did something wonderful for that man, and I like that.

Stereotyping every American as a fat, racist, asshole is as bad as stereotyping every middle-eastern person as a terrorist.
But not in Mexico. 
German was the second most spoken language by a wide margin up until the 20th century when it fell out of grace because of political issues.
I believe there are still some regional newspapers printed in German around Pennsylvania.
My grandparents' parents wouldn't allow English to be spoken in their homes. German only.
Best I could find is this. I think I learned it on the history channel years ago. Could do more research.   http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/can-la.htm
And it creates jobs. 
it's a huge pile of bullshit. Anybody who is anybody in international business speaks English, and any American that needs to learns languages. Hell there's only like 4 widely spoken languages in the Western Hemisphere anyway, English, Spanish, French and Portuguese. 
Don't bother trying arguing with the fantasy that supports his own 'linguistic superiority complex.'
Why the quotation marks?

I find it amusing that you use the term balkanization, when the languages of the Balkans are largely inter-intelligible and primarily differentiated for social and political reasons.

About 50 miles out from my town, and you wouldn't be able to understand a word the people were saying, and they speak English.

So to answer your question, while language is one component of culture, in a society that accepts and affirms the backgrounds of multiple (large) groups of citizens, there's only marginal difficulty in handling multi-language concerns. For example, if 70% of US residents spoke both Spanish and English, then there'd really be no issue at all. The fact that so many people cling to the "one country, one language" meme is the main reason that there's difficulty communicating across cultures.
Yeah, I know.

We do not all just speak English...if you want an example go to any border state or a state where immigrants usually enter this country and then visit them again in five years...more likely than not the people you saw arriving would know both languages and there would be more people working on learning English as well as speaking their home language...the point was that we are all Americans...we all live here, play here, work here, and likely will die here as Americans. Language is not what defines America-it is a set of ideals-of freedom and justice and liberty. By stating the song should have been in only English goes against those ideals more than someone being patriotic and singing the song...it shows assimilation through just learning the damn thing.

Remind me again what the US Official Language is?
I have no opinion in this subject, but can I just offer a bit of debate advice: Leave out the non-sequiturs, they're not helping your argument.

As a Mick Foley fan, I absolutely understood and nodded in acknowledgement.
You should come to St. Louis sometime and watch a concert.

Artist: I hate Chicago!  
Crowd: *goes wild*  
Artist: I have no feelings at all towards Kansas City!  
Crowd: (*pause to think about it*) *goes wild*


EDIT: Also, you'll notice that the "pop" crowd is mostly Yankees.  You know, the ones who don't speak American.
New England? That doesn't sound very American!

(It's soda BTW)
Isn't that a test for the lay-deez?
No, it's not old folks. Old folks aren't on Twitter and Facebook. No, these are young, vibrant, racists who will live for another 40-60 years.
It's hilarious that you fucking leftist never want to talk about the black crime rate, the black std rate, the number of unwed black mothers....

No, everything is 'racist' to you and your little fantasy world. 
but why? what about it annoys you? we americanize everything. so it's suddenly a crime when other nationalities do it to us? we should be at the very least glad to have people who actually still like us after all the bullshit we've put every other country through.

edit: I think it's petty for large companies to exploit nationalism or social issues to advertise a product i.e. every truck commercial or budweiser commercial. I just also disagree with the bigots out there who actually care about silly things like language barriers and who are against social equality
opinions are one thing,  being a hateful piece of shit is another. so yes I hope they die so their ignorance can't be spread.
Their opinions are wrong and no one is wishing death. Just making a point this will continue until the racist die out. 
aye, you're right..well hopefully public acknowledgement of their ignorance is enough to make them change their ways and to quit being hateful. I doubt it will, but there is a chance
>Then you have to also be ok media overblowing stories that you don't support.  

You take the good with the bad, I suppose.

>And also be ok with racists having free speech on Twitter.  

I am ok with it.  And with the fact that freedom of speech also means that other people are free to call someone a racist cockwaffle.

>I'm ok with all of these things, I just don't know if stories like "4 or 5 people on Twitter complained about something!!" should be on this sub.

It's more than 4 or 5.  Here's a very pleasant sampler platter:

The problem is that these people live in a bubble world where everyone  good is (probably) white and (definitely) Christian, and everyone else is bad.  They need to be called on it.  They NEED to be told that they are wrong, and shown so.  I doubt many of their minds will ever be changed.  But maybe then they'll see they're at least not as much in the majority as they think.
I'm addicted and it melted my enamel like butter. 
well they had him on the news this morning and he said he didn't even know it was for a commercial until a few days ago, he got back in November or something. I would have been so pissed, that is until the big fat check landed in my mailbox.
(I would look at some of the other stories on that site before you go looking for the actual commercial.  It's a satire website very popular with the US Military)
We should just use the wage slaves to produce more. 
Sorry, forgot to tag with /s. The money to send kids over is always easy to find, but when they get back? Nothing but our top men.
YES! THAT'S WHAT WE NEED! MORE IGNORANCE AND BLIND ALLEGIANCE! 

Um, statistically, one in three Americans are fat and we can prove that. 27.2 % to be exact in 2013. If you just factor in adults 20 and up, it climbs to around 32%.

Can you prove how many middle-eastern people are terrorists? And then back that up with some legitimate statistics? 

OK, didn't figure you could.
So we should give monolingual people giant tax breaks? They are the job creators after all.
Personal writing style is to put in tone to the words of importance to me. When speaking, we use voice tone and body language to put emphasis on ideas or words we believe they are important, while in writing, punctuation does the job.
Was it fish playing football? 
yyyeeeeaaaahhhh, but still tastes good. 
ok, well that makes more sense then.
i didn't notice. why didn't they put any white people in there?
i wasn't outraged by it. i liked it. I just think its lame that Coke sells that shitty Fructose crap to Americans, and the rest of the world gets the sugar version.

By the way, I thought the outrage was about calling America Beautiful or something. i guess it was a bunch of racist idiots on twitter who can't even speak english themselves.
Cute but does not solve the problem of people not being able to communicate with each other over important topics. We need to be one america and language is important.
Its a comment website, people type fast and may be inaccurate with spelling and grammar at times. Only people with an inferiority complex points these things out to make themselves feel better about themselves.
I hope you feel better about yourself by pointing out grammar and spelling mistakes on a comment site. You need a boost in your self esteem.
Sarcasm?  On the internet?


Pfffft.
tell you homie. cant wait when murika will start choosing official languages.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States

"Moma Booboo took 10 years shool to learn murican and now those Chicago wanna me to speak irish! neahhaa!"
Heritage wasn't mentioned.

If you really want to get nitpicky, even Native American ancestors immigrated to the Americas over the land bridge thousands of years ago.

Focus on the present and future. The past is history, literally. We should remember it and learn from it, but not cling to it.
It's American Indian, ass. And people born in America are not foreigners to America.
>Most Americans won't ever be bilingual. Some because they haven't the smarts or the patience for it, and some because "AH ALREADY TALK DA BEST LANGUAGE IN THE URTH: American!"

And some because everyone speaks English without a 20-hour drive from their home.

America is big.  It's really, really big.  And Canada is pretty big too.  If you don't leave really really close to Mexico or Quebec, if you can drive 20 hours away and everyone still speaks English, you don't have as much need to learn another language, don't see as much advantage to it, and it is MUCH MUCH harder to learn one because it can be HARD to find people to practice with.

I loved studying Spanish in school, and I studied it in college too, but I never got fluent.  I had the smarts.  I didn't have any Spanish speaking friends that were willing to spend hours talking to me just to let me practice.  I couldn't go anywhere English wasn't spoken.  Even the bilingual places, since they understand English, they'd just as soon I use it so they don't have to endure my broken Spanish.

The environment is stacked against bilingualism in the US, but a lot of that really is geography, not laziness or jingoism.
English. That's why the Constitution and the bill of rights are written in English. Our official position that there is no official language of America has nothing to do with the fact that the de facto official language is English. 
As someone much, *much* further west who knows very little about such things... St. Louis hates Chicago that much, huh?

I now have you tagged Thinks Pop is soda in res. 


you betcha... hey ladies, may i interest you in some Payp?  always gets em, right in the chonies.
I'd venture a guess there's far less young racists today then there were 40 years ago though. The internet just gives them a louder voice.
I just prefer that American patriotic songs should be sung in English. It's just my opinion. 
Society progresses one death at a time.  People tend to forget this will remain true when their time comes as well.
Their opinions are different, not wrong.  Opinions aren't based in fact, so it's not possible for it to be wrong.  The only thing from any of the tweets that's incorrect is the assertion that 'we speak English', which is probably just ignorance.

As long as we're on the opinion train, I think that the people that are upset about a few tweets are just as ridiculous as the people that are upset with the commercial.  Shit, don't we have better things to bitch and moan about?
I still don't think all these news websites giving these few people a stage is a perfect solution. Also you can't verify who's trolling on twitter and who isn't.

Also a bunch of apathetic scoffs on comment sections aren't solving anything, and just making those commenters build up more and more hate of the racist, straw man hick in their imagination.

Also also, it's just making reporting lazier.

A lot of the ones you linked to have like 1 or 2 favorites or retweets. That conversation happened betwen 2 or 3 people. That's not news.


Ah crap, my bad. 
that's because the men that return have real problems.  Hell, our leaders and their adjuncts can't even say (let alone tell us) the reasons we are at war to begin with.

It's all very complicated.


I'm pretty sure "rascist asshole" was the truly contentious part, but way to be an ass.
You can find stats "kinda" backing up a lot of stereotypes, but that doesn't make one stereotype any more deserved than another. Stat or no stat he was just saying he doesn't want to be generalized. 
While I agree with the original sentiment, for someone criticizing syntax and grammar, you have a very unconventional style of punctuation. 
Nope.  It was not a game - it was **FISH BOWL**:

http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/videos/nat-geo-wilds-fish-bowl/
you can get the sugar version from Costco. They still sell the Mexican version in real glass bottles. 
How can you mistype an "e" for an "a"? It's pretty hard to do, I think. No, it was much more likely to be ignorance of what the right word to use is. In an educator, that is just plain wrong. It has much less to do with my ego than it has to do with how distracting and grating it is to read a sentence when those words are used incorrectly. It's sort of like fingernails scraping on a chalk board. It totally distracts from the train of thought. I could probably excuse it in anyone but an educator.
just pointing them out as evidence of you not being what you claim
I get that you're a troll and everything, but if you're sorta complaining that 80% of the US speaks english, US has more foreign born citizens than UK, France, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, and pretty much every country in Europe except Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland and Austria.

And US immigrants make up 20% of the planet's immigrants.


>English.

Huh, that's odd.  Because last I checked the US had *no official language*.  Please go ahead and cite where is explicitly states otherwise.  *States* on the other hand may or may not have an official language.  Some even have publish official documents in several languages.

> That's why the Constitution and the bill of rights are written in English.

No, it was written in English because that was the most common language at the time.  That doesn't make English the official language.

> Our official position that there is no official language of America has nothing to do with the fact that the de facto official language is English. 

It has *everything* to do with it.  There is no official language, and just because a certain language is the most *common* doesn't make it official.  So what happens if/when Spanish becomes the most dominant language?  Will you then say that Spanish is the now official language?
Oh, yes.  It's jealousy, to be sure, but it's a powerful force and a cheap way for a musician to get the crowd on his/her side.
I'm not so sure about this.
Yeah, I can't ignore that. I guess a lot of my statement is based on confirmation bias. I just get bogged down sometimes with dealing with this shit, thinking, "How can you be so dumb?"
Why? The United States has no national language, and we are a nation of immigrants, many of whom choose to both learn English and maintain aspects of their previous culture. E pluribus unum and all that shit. Why does patriotism have to mean enforced homogeneity?
Okay, just don't be offended when people call you idiotic for caring about such silly things
It is my opinion that opinions can be wrong.  By your logic, what you consider my wrong opinion about wrong opinions being wrong can't be wrong.
Opinions can totally be wrong, when they direct hatred at innocent people just for existing. 
We are trying to make a world without hate, racism, and bigotry.  In order for that to happen, opinions like that need to be wrong. You can't just give equal weight to garbage like that.

So if my opinion was that women who engage in sex before marriage should be stoned to death, you don't believe my opinion would be wrong?

Society determines what is right and wrong and in our society both stoning people to death and racism is wrong.


I have about a thousand followers on twitter but rarely get more than 1 or 2 retweets.  Just because a conversation doesn't happen doesn't mean I didn't say something.
no, that would have made a fantastic commercial.  Sadly i think soldiers would laugh and every one else would cry.


Maybe. But I started out my statement with "Personal writing style". Im not an English native speaker and have never lived in an English speaking country. I studied English academically and have developed a personal writing style to converse non verbally. Thank you for the feedback. I strive to enhance my languages skills.
For 4 hours? I'm assuming that there weren't many advertisements?
maybe when your typing fast on a comment site you make mistakes that you would not make when you are preparing something to be sent in your professional life. That is why people reread their work in professional life but on a comment board do not, unless they have time. As for fingernails on a chalk board, your poor significant other, they must have to hear that all the time when you speak
Spanish IS expected to be the dominant language in the US by the middle or towards the end of this century. That means unless Americans of all races and ethnicities learn Spanish, they will be marginalized and discriminated in their own country.

It's already happening, in social welfare sector, the ability to speak Spanish is a requirement.  

De facto official language IS the official language for the practical purpose. Governmental functions at all levels are conducted in English. 

Arguing whether or not there is Federally recognized language is really semantics. 
Seems like you care about it more than I do. I just rolled my eyes and moved on with my life. I disagreed with it, but I'm not disrespectful about it. So I don't see how it's being idiotic. 
Now that's a thinker.
An opinion is not about right or wrong.  An opinion is a belief or feeling.  Just because that's your opinion doesn't mean that it's fair or how the world actually works.

An opinion is not fact.  Opinions are totally inconsequential to the real world.

This is all I'm trying to convey.  A tiny number of people say something that has absolutely no bearing on anything and the world is making it into front page news.

I wasn't counting, but I don't remember a lot of commercials.  I didn't watch it that long.  It was a joke, and that's how I took it.
The problem with your reasoning is that an educated person should not need to reread and correct such a mistake. It should be second nature to them to know the difference between "then" and "than". They should have made a concerted effort to apply the correct usage from the time they learned the difference. If they did not think it was worth the effort to correct themselves, you can bet your sweet bippy that they pass on the error to students in their care daily, thus perpetuating ignorance and putting the students at a real world disadvantage. This educator needs to shape up, stop being mentally shiftless and make a much better effort on themself first. 

Here is why correct use of language is so important. Language is the main tool we use for thinking. Almost all great ideas start as a sub-lingual thought. If you do not have the tools needed for precise thinking, you cannot have precise thoughts. A person who only knows the word “blue” is at a distinct disadvantage compared to a person who also knows “turquoise” and “azure”. We must insist on educators who excel in the use of the tools of thinking. We should not only insist that those who teach have excellent language skills but that they also be better than competent in mathematics, another tool for thinking with clarity. We should not accept slipshod abilities in our educators.
You keep saying that your mistakes are because it's a comment board and you type fast, but you're making grammar and spelling mistakes on a regular basis.
> Spanish IS expected to be the dominant language in the US by the middle or towards the end of this century.

Which is exactly why I mentioned it.  If you think that because the majority speak English today makes it the official language then you'll have to recognize Spanish once it becomes the majority language.  You can't have one without the other.

> De facto official language IS the official language for the practical purpose. Governmental functions at all levels are conducted in English.

>Arguing whether or not there is Federally recognized language is really semantics. 

It may be semantics, but it's true.  Just because majority speaks English still doesn't make it the official language, but it *does* make sense to run the government of the people by the people's common language.  It's a very distinct point that I'm not sure you understand here.  For example, today since the majority speaks English, the government functions in English.  In a few decades when Spanish is the official language there is nothing to prevent the government from functioning in Spanish to follow the common language.  However, if English were the official language, then it would prevent government from flipping to Spanish.
haha because you mine as well be mad at anyone who doesn't speak english. it's absurd to even roll your eyes at it. I could see rolling your eyes at the fact that it was advertising a product, but getting annoyed at the fact that a patriotic song isn't sung in just english is ignorant. you can sugarcoat it all you want, but it's ignorant regardless.
Ideas have consequences. Bad ideas have bad consequences. 
LOL Is there anything else at all going on in your life. Your a real sicko let it go overcome the OCD.
Why dont you list them since you have nothing else to do with your life.
your autismal rage is astounding

And in Quebec they have done just that to preserve their identity and heritage. 

Now the question is what backlash we will have in the US if we indeed make English the official languages for ALL. Just look at this mess. There is a significant number of people who are irked by the commercial which suggest that they DO want English as the official language. 

And it makes sense as the origin of our nation is rooted in English and if Spanish become the dominant language, the Americans won't even be able to understand their Bill of rights without a translation. 

That's a travesty and historically criminal if you ask me. 
But I'm not mad at anyone who doesn't speak English. I grew up on the border and I'm bilingual myself. I just think songs that are specifically patriotic for America should not be changed to other languages. Those types of songs are what unite the melting pot, and shouldn't be tailored to other languages. It should be the same song that we all share.
Yes, thankfully, there is plenty going on in my life. Thank you for your concern. 

I wanted to add that I also think we should pay our educators enough so that we can choose from the very best minds to pass knowledge to our children rather than scrape the bottom of the barrel and depend on those willing to work for the pittance that they currently get.
That makes no sense, you've invested way more time and energy into this argument than I have. All I did was read this comment thread and point out that you've made multiple grammatical or spelling mistakes in literally every single post, despite desperately defending your claim that you are a qualified educator. It's one thing to have shitty grammar (like most people on the internet), it's another to do so when you're supposedly educating children and spouting naive xenophobia over a language you obviously don't know very well.

But for one, "your" isn't the same as "you're." 
   Look at the Nutrition for FF:   Start with the serving size:  3/4 of a cup.   Then consider the size of a bowl, do people consume the 3/4cup portion.    I'm betting NO.   So eat all the crap you want, but  Kellogg  like most Corporations are depending on people not reading the serving size.   Note:  that serving size contains  11 gn. of sugar.
All that dihydrogen monoxide in coke. That shit is lethal in large doses:p
I don't like Tom Brady...but I agree with him on this issue
It is packaged foods in general. They have more salt, more chemicals, and more unnecessary ingredients than home cooked meals. 
All refined* sugar is poison really. We dump it unscrupulously into almost every processed food, but it is absolutely horrible or our bodies. An entire industry is centered around sugar, which at its most basic is a drug that slowly destroys people. Sugar has zero nutritional value. 

Before industrialization and modern diets, people consumed sugar only rarely. It was a treat, something people are occasionally or at special events. And even when people are it, it was less refined and they used way less. Beer used to be the most common form of sugar intake. Today sugar intake has ballooned, and it's in everything. 

Now we have people who eat sugar with every meal, who think nothing of handing their child a candy bar. We see companies actively deceiving their customers, claiming things are "healthy", "organic", etc. while dumping copious amounts of sugar into it. 

Another problem is *added salt*, not quite to the same degree but still totally asinine.
Sugar is toxic to the human body, in sufficient amounts it will cause liver damage and eventually failure. It is also habit forming to the point that test mice who have been addicted to cocaine will switch over and prefer sugar over the cocaine once the sugar is introduced. 
*source - Google it dumba$$ 😀

>"Numerous studies show that a cereal breakfast is associated with lower BMIs (body mass index) in both children and adults. As a matter of fact, a serving of Frosted Flakes with skim milk has just 150 calories and delivers valuable nutrients including calcium, B vitamins and iron," the statement reads.

And >100% of your daily value of sugar intake. But hey, let's not mention that.
Welp, there goes the Coke and Kelloggs sponsorship.
I think deflated balls are poison for kids
Tom - I don't care what you think of Coca-Cola.

But not liking Frosted Flakes is un-American.  Fuck off!

If I want advice on how to deflate footballs or make millions by throwing things and getting repeated head trauma I'll ask you, Tom.  Getting my nutritional advice from you somehow feels a bit like getting medical advice from Jenny McCarthy.
Shut-Up Tom. Your job is to throw a football, not have an opinion on what's good for kids.

HFC is literally a poison (it makes you hungry, addicted, and fat, the definition of a poison), so he is right about sugary soda and cereals.
Welcome to America, where our people will fight for freedom of choice, speech, and religion, but gleefully demand that you give up all foods that taste even remotely good.

The amount of smug in this thread is unbelievable.

Look, I'm 35 years old, about 10 pounds overweight, and I eat whatever I damn well please.  Health nuts will tell you that you should be 20 pounds UNDER weight (and still exercise 7 hours a day), but frankly, I'm happy where I am.  I've drank two pepsi's a day for the last 11 years and I love bread and pasta.  I just saw my doctor and was given a clean bill of health (aside from my family's history of sleep apnea) with a cholesterol level of 162.

I am more convinced than ever that it's not as much about WHAT we eat as it's about HOW MUCH we eat.  I rarely get near 2000 calories in a day.  I eat small portions of food and drink a full bottle of water with each meal.

Bottom line - let me eat whatever the hell I want.  I'd rather eat Frosted Flakes over a plate of fruit or whatever any given day.  Organic food is expensive and comes packaged with dead bugs, and the non-stop pontificating from health nuts only makes me want to dive into my bag of potato chips and guzzle another Pepsi.  I have yet to find a so-called "healthy" alternative food that makes me say, "Wow, that was delicious!"

So diet-shame people all you want, but you're not going to win anyone over until you find some of this healthy stuff that actually tastes good.

Oh, and by the way - the phrase "acquired taste" is not the same as "this food is delicious."  It's code for "I convinced myself to like it after a while".
I'm guessing Coca-Cola and Frosted Flakes didn't pay him enough money to do their ads so he's trying to revenge them.
u/sotpmoke haha, he's a douche 
Fuck Tom Brady. Fuck him up his stupid ass.
Lol right cause when you put sugar on something it stops being food. what a fucking moron, he is probably big into religion isn't he?
I have a feeling these are the fucked-up things Tom Brady's dad told him while he was riding his ass to become a star quarterback.
Its fine to dislike it and say how bad it is for people, but dont be jerks to people who enjoy it.
This is the main issue.  Look at the statement kellogs released.  Its laughable.  

"150 calories per serving, served with SKIM MILK"

Ok, so 3/4 of a cup of cereal and skim milk qualify as a balanced breakfast, and the person is still hungry because no one would ever want to just eat 3/4 of a cup, let alone eat it with SKIM MILK.  

If cereal is served in a fucking bowl, the serving size should be a fucking bowl.  
Wat?  There's no nutrition in Frosted Flakes. It has nothing to do with "Serving size".  One serving of junk is not food. 

Eat some eggs, ferchrissakes.  Eat food. not junk. 

came here to say this.
> quoted text It is ~~packaged~~ mass produced foods in general. They have more salt, more ~~chemicals~~ preservatives, and more unnecessary ingredients than home cooked meals.

Anything with more than one element in it is a chemical, it's really a silly buzzword that means nothing. 
I read somewhere recently that is in large part due to the fact that the mass production style of agriculture has stripped the flavor out of food, and all the additives are necessary now in order to taste anything. Hell, even bottled water says it has flavorants added. 
You do realize that fruits and other "natural" foods contain sugar, right? do you also realize that the human body converts starches (i.e. potatoes and bread) into sugar as a metabolic process? From your post, it looks like you're claiming that before industrialization humans rarely consumed fruits or potatoes. I don't know if your wording is just bad or if you really don't know what you're talking about. The main harm sugar has to the human body is that it's incredibly high in calories, and thus it's way too easy to consume too much of. 
I am thinking I'd be pretty fucked without it. I consume sugar as my only nourishment my entire day until 10p when I eat a meal of meat and veggie type food. Otherwise, a couple bags of mini candy bars a day or half  gallon of ice cream etc is what I eat each and every day to keep going.

Oh and I am 47, 6' 190 with a six pack still, dunno how, and under 9% body fat and I do nothing but game on this comp all day every single day for going on 12 years now. My stats haven't changed a bit in that 12 years, not even a pudge on my waist except for 6 months after quit smoking 6 years back then it fell off.

My point to this long reply is people are different. Research is for general results and affects. Not many things, including drugs work the same on everyone, we are all different and our body processes things differently. 

So sugar may be the devil for most of you but it is a lifeline for some of us.
Does this mean I only have to give my friend some sugar and he will kick his cocaine habit?
Its actually not >100% of your daily value of sugar intake. According to the American Heart Association you shouldn't have more than 37.5 grams as a guy or 25 grams as a woman; while Frosted Flakes only has 10 grams per serving.

And it isn't just orange juice. It is almost everything you find in a grocery store.
> You do realize that fruits and other "natural" foods contain sugar, right?

Research shows that sugar itself is not the problem, but sugar extracted from it's naturally-occurring complement of fiber.  Therefore, a glass of orange juice is much worse for you than an orange.  

Stop drinking juice and coke, stop eating entennmann's donuts, and stop consuming any other processed sugar, and you will immediately lose weight and become healthier. 


You do know complex carbs are good and because they contain fiber you dont over eat. Remove fiber and you eat more.
Actually most fruits we eat today have been selectively bred over decades to be sweeter and sweeter. 

Foods like potatoes and bread were eaten, but this is much different than eating refined sugar, especially the kinds of bread they were eating back then (it wasn't wonder bread). Even fruits, while full of sugar do not stack up to things like coke. 

Take apples for example, you have 1 apple, perfectly healthy. However, you drink a small carton of apple juice and you've just consumed 5 apples worth of sugar. 

Sugar and carbs are kind of like fossil fuels. They are not necessary to consume in high levels, but you get way more bang for your buck. Sugar is easy energy, and it's addictive. 
Natural sugar is different than refined sugar, yes.
Why would you eat sugar like that everyday though? Either way, your personal anecdote doesn't mean much in the face of ever-mounting scientific consensus that refined sugar plays virtually no nutritional role whatsoever.
yes, if he is a mouse
No, it means if you give your cocaine-ingesting friend some sugar, he will then have two toxins in his body. 

Look at the serving size. Do you really think anyone is eating just one serving?
Most of his knowledge seems to center around information about cats.

I'm addicted to water. It's gotten so bad that if I stop, I'll die.
HFC causes addiction by making you depressed. Water doesn't do that.
And every gram of it was a delight.
Is that supposed to make me recoil in disgust or something?  Because it doesn't.  I don't care.  People have been drinking soda for decades before sugar Nazi's decided to proclaim themselves the superior beings.  Humanity marched along just fine.

Today's obesity problem isn't happening because the world hasn't converted to vegan diets or whatever nasty food substitutes you think I should force myself to eat.  Today's obesity problem is because people don't know how to eat in moderation or exercise themselves.  Instead, they'd rather sit on their cell phones yammering on about the latest gossip or facebooking or whatever else people do with those damn things glued to their faces.  Parents let electronic entertainment do the parenting for them and don't tell their kids to go outside and play or encourage them to get involved with creative or extra-curricular activities.  Instead of taking responsibility for our own laziness, we blame everyone BUT ourselves.  "I'M FAT BECAUSE CEREAL!" "THE SODA MADE ME FAT I HAD NO IDEA THEY SHOULD HAVE WARNING LABELS NOT MY FAULT BLAAAHHHHHH"

No, you're fat because you're a lazy and undisciplined bum.  I'll continue to enjoy my Frosted Flakes, thank you very much.  Then I'll go rollerblading in the park while you post pictures of your fried chicken dinner to facebook.
He wasn't saying they weren't nutritional, he was saying Coca-Cola is poison and Frosted Flaked aren't food at all. Big difference.

Whats the fucking point of skim milk. get regular milk and water it down.
You're weird. 
> I eat cereal with skim milk

What gave you the idea this was good food?  
Cereal is garbage. Your body needs FAT. 

Eat some real food. Every day, wake up and eat EGGS.  Three of em.  Plus veggies.  Hot tea if you want something to drink. 

No more cereal.  cmon, man. 

More like water that identifies as milk, a so-called transfluidoid.
Good on you! I am considering canning some of the products  of my little garden.

That said, the word chemical" is spectacularly general, as is the word "organic." Please consider narrowing down the discussion to the chemicals in question, because you might as well use the words "matter" and "carbon-containing matter" and it would be equally clear. 

I'm not meaning to be pedantic, but the words "chemical" and "organic" are too broad to mean anything, and it's not a good idea to try and map specific chemicals to the entire set of chemicals in a discussion, because it makes you sound lazy (which you are not, of course, because you make your own canned goods).
>  Even orange juice isn't safe. 

Even if orange juice were 100% organic, tastest great, and has  just been squeezed from the orange, IT STILL ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU.  

The problem is your body has evolved to process carbohydrates in their natiural form: eg, oranges, not orange juice. Extract the sugar (juice) away from the fiber (the rest of the orange) and ingest that, and you will gain weight. 

lesson: eat natural foods, not processed stuff.  Eat an orange, don't drink a glass of juice.  Even 100% no-sugar-added juice is still going to cause you to add fat.  Google Dr Robert Lustig for more info.  

srsly.

you'll lose weight because you're consuming less calories, not because you're not eating sugar. Go eat 5,000 calories a day in natural, un-processed food every day for a year and we'll what your weight looks like. 

I'm pretty sure you've never even opened a biology book, cause that shit's pretty basic. 
You're missing the point though, whether or not things overall are "sweeter" now than they were in the past, doesn't matter. The point is that "refined sugar" on it's own is not necessarily bad for you, because it's literally the exact same thing from a metabolic standpoint as naturally occurring sugar. If you consume too many calories per day, you will get fat. However, you'll get just as fat eating 5000 calories per day in refined sugar as you will eating 5000 calories per day in meat or 5000 calories in sugar from Apples and Oranges. If you don't burn off calories and you eat too much, you will get fat and be unhealthy, no matter where those calories are coming from. 
but natural sugar is processed by the body in the exact same way as refined sugar is. The only thing that makes an apple with 5g of sugar different from a donut with 5g of sugar is that the apple has other things that are healthy for you (i.e. nutrients). As far as your body is concerned, the sugar is exactly the same. 

Look at this example if you need something to put it in perspective
http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/
This guy went on a diet with an above average amount of refined sugar in it, but because he was healthy other than that (i.e. he ate fewer calories than usual and maintained a healthy nutrient intake) he was able to lose weight and, overall, become healthier. 

SUGAR ON ITS OWN WILL NOT MAKE YOU FAT. A pound of fat gained from eating too much sugar is exactly the same as a pound of fat gained from eating too many vegetables, too much meat, or too much dairy. That being said, calories gained from eating sugar will be far less filling and satiating than calories from healthy food, but don't let that obscure the point. In the end, fat loss (and as a result, the majority of benefits from being healthy) comes from a simple calculation of calories in vs. calories out. 
Consumption of sugar really has a very small impact on overall health. A much better indicator would be a combination of calories consumed, calories burned through exercise, and nutrients consumed. You can eat a sugary dessert every day and as long as the rest of your lifestyle is healthy, you'll be absolutely fine. 
Yep, Mr. Bojangles is going to be ecstatic about this news.
What you posted was based on the serving size; I just wanted to keep the amount we were discussing standardized. Also, there are lots of people out there that do eat things at the proper serving size and don't feel the need to have 13 servings of everything they eat
What you mean to say is that it FITS the definition of poison, not that it IS the definition of poison.
Yeah, people are so addicted that even in a hot as fuck desert with scorpions and shit they still spend time looking for their next hit
I don't know...if I'm drinking a bottle of water when what I really want is a Dr. Pepper, I'm going to be pretty depressed. 
No I was just doing math, I found it interesting.
Look, anyone who isn't mentally disabled knows he's not being literal. 

Like if I'm with friends and I have this exchange:

Me: Hey, let's go get some food!

Bill: Yeah, let's go to burger king!

Me: NO, asshole. I said FOOD. 

That doesn't mean that I literally think Burger King is inedible matter, just that I think it's no good. 
> Skim milk is garbage.

For that matter, Cereal is garbage.
2% milk is way more calories though

i dont wanna be a fatty again
The point is:  same nutrients, less fat.  

Watering down milk means: less nutrients, less fat.

I'm not saying skim milk is good.  I'm answering your question.
It tastes just like 2% and is healthier soo...
Ugh. Nerds. 
You're going to catch pure hell fire for this.

There are people on Reddit who have never had weight problems in their entire lives telling people who have studied nutrition and lost weight out of necessity that it's nothing but *calories in, calories out! exercise! moderation!*

You mention something about the sugar content in food and some jackass who has never had an issue with sugar affecting his or her weight will tell you you're wrong, and that it's only about calories.

It's so annoying.  I have a hereditary level of insulin resistance (all adults in my family are type 1 and type 2 diabetics) that I had to learn about and retrain my body to crave and eat the right foods.  I am 5'8" and 125lbs as of today after learning that for me sugar is the motherfucking devil.
> pretty sure you've never even opened a biology book, cause that shit's pretty basic. 

Thanks for playing, but no. 

Did you do what I told you to do?  Did you google Robert Lustig?  I bet you didn't.  Because he confronts the myth that "a calorie is a calorie" and shows that it's false, and explains the bio-physiology behind what's happening.  In fact, calories without the accompanying fiber cause greater weight gain. Proven in multiple studies. 


He's excited about everything when he's on blow though...
And a serving size is based on bullshit.  We can pretend to believe that 3/4 a cup of cereal is an actual serving size or we can admit that most people are filling up a bowl.
> Look, anyone who isn't mentally disabled knows he's not being literal.

Maybe you should actually read everything he said then. He called them poison and not food and then want on to explain why they were poison and not food. 

Even if he wasn't being literal, he just needs to shut up. I'm tired of celebrities feeling the need to go and make comments like this. He may be an athlete, but he isn't an expert on nutrition. He pays people to come up with all of his meal and work out plans.
[removed]
> i dont wanna be a fatty again

That's the paradox.  By depriving your body of fat, which is a natural component of a complete diet, you keep yourself hungry, forcing yourself to eat more empty non-fat carb-laden calories, thereby.... getting FAT. 

Seriously. Eat fat to get skinny.  If your system gets lots of  fat, your body will start shedding body fat, because it adapts to the plentiful fat in the diet.  If you deprive your body of fat (eg, heavy carb and sugar diet),  it will stockpile fat. 

Look at the obesity rates in the USA after 1980, when "low fat" foods became the rage.  What happened?   C'mon. 

It does not taste like 2%.  But that ever floats your boat.
It's not "healthier". Fat as a component of a meal or food item has been grossly bastardized. There's plenty of research out there that says you should use whole milk if you are going drink/use milk.
whole milk is the only milk.
1% milk tastes like 2% (still a noticeable difference, but its fairly small).  

The basic flavors of skim milk are similar, but taste "thinner" and a bit more watered down.  2% tastes fatty compared to skim milk.
His motorcycle driving might get safer.
> And a serving size is based on bullshit.

I strongly disagree. I also have a feeling you don't know how much cereal 3/4 of a cup is
>  I'm tired of celebrities feeling the need to go and make comments like this.

He was asked a question.

If you don't want to know Tom Brady's opinion on something, don't listen to or read interviews with Tom Brady. 
yeah and you'll be fat if you eat a lot of calories 

if i switched from skim to 2% i'd probably have another 100 - 200 calories a day lol

they taste the same so i don't see a good reason to drink the one with more calories?
can you tell me what pizza tastes like to me, too? im gonna have a slice for lunch and you apparently have my tastebuds 
It has less calories, and 1 gram of protein extra per serving. So yeah it is healthier. 
Don't be a smug asshole.  A cup isn't an obscure reference.  Anyone that's cooked knows what a cup is.

3/4 of a cup is not a full bowl of cereal.  Watch a kid pour his own cereal out and see what they consider a serving size.  Look at the front of the box and notice the cereal bowl filled to the brim, sometimes splashing out because it's so full.  Serving sizes come from outdated surveys done in the 70's and 80's.
He was asked a question that was completely unrelated. Did you actual read the whole interview?
[removed]
calories =/= weight gain 
I'll tell you that your pizza sucks and the one I'm having is way better.
Caloric content does not equal nutritious or healthy. By that inane reasoning, Coke Zero is good for you. 
> Don't be a smug asshole. A cup isn't an obscure reference. Anyone that's cooked knows what a cup is.

It actually sounds even more like you don't after reading this most recent post.

> 3/4 of a cup is not a full bowl of cereal

Duh, ever heard of using milk?

Also why are you arguing about this? I was responding to someone talking about nutrition in relation to the serving size? It almost appears that you only replied to me because you wanted to fight about something that no one really cares about. So please step off your soapbox and shut up
i guess i just imagined losing 40 pounds in the last year by eating less and working out more
Your making connections here that is unrelated.You are talking about general nutrition. Other people here are talking about weight.The two are exclusive. You can mess with your weight but not take in any of the vitamins you need.Weight is simply calories in and out. However that doesn't do anything for your bodies other functions. So yea you are right that nutrition is more than calories, but not weight.
yeah if you just eat a million calories you won't gain weight

weight loss = calories in < calories out
Actually yes, it does.Weight = calories gained -calories lost.So you calculate your TDEE, which is the daily amount of calories you need to maintain your current body relative to your activity level. If you eat over it, you gain weight. Eat under, you lose weight.
Alright.  You're an absolute douche bag.  This isn't going to go anywhere knowing that.  Nobody uses 1+ cup of milk for 3/4 cup of cereal.  That's what the average sized bowl would hold.  Looking through your comment history, I see that you know everything and like to make others feel like they know nothing.  Not a good way to communicate, but that's for you to figure out.

Guy from hovercraft co goes to Tx, does rescues, finds corpses, and when informed by fire dept that there is lots of bottled water in a warehouse surrounded by flood, hacksaws in breaks a window, loads up 14 cases bottled water delivers to Nat Guard to distribute.
This headline is incredibly dumb.

They had permission to take it. It wasn't stealing.
nice to see big corporate doing the right thing.
I don't think it counts as stealing if you have permission.
To add: the coca cola company called the fire department informing them of the bottled water inside and said that they can help themselves to as much as they want if they can get to it.

"Warning: you don't understand science"
Of all the dietary things to care about, GMO's are probably the lowest on the list, by far.

Why not support better labeling of food contents? The current nutritional info on food has the basic info, but it's presentation format is horrible. They should use something like this instead: http://sativashakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/foodlabelwheel.jpg

A green segment means it's good, yellow means it's OK, and red means it's pretty bad. If you want low sodium, stick to the food items with green in the salt slice. It's easy to recognize, instant, and effective.

On the other hand, to compare 2 boxes of cereal I have to start by comparing the serving sizes - because they are certainly not the same. Honey Nut Cheerios has a serving size of 3/4 cup, but the Cheerios Protein variety has serving sizes of 1 1/4 cup. Cheerios were the breakfast refuge of the OCD, but not any more when they dance around 1-cup servings like that. Then I figure out how much I actually eat of it, then compare the numbers or percentages to my goal. I shouldn't need to take all those steps to answer the simple question "does this have a lot of sodium?"
Vermont is a small enough market my that the companies should just pull out until the law is appealed. If they worked together to do so it might be an antitrust issue but there's no reason for them to not punish the state for blatantly hurting their business for no good reason.

Smokey and the Bandit: 2016
Cool, they can stop drinking that garbage and pick up real beverages. Obviously, GMOs aren't what are going to kill you, but if people don't want to consume them, that's they're right under a free market.

Are you kidding me? Coke has like 42g of sugar and whatever else is may contain is dubious at best. The other products such as Diet/Zero are pure chemicals in liquid form. If products such as these are pulled from the state. Why IT'S GREAT FREAKING NEWS PEOPLE! :) 


Temporarily.  Probably only long enough to re-format the labels.
It did in this particular instance accidentally ban something very unhealthy. Not that I support banning unhealthy foods, but taking coke out actually might help the health of the community. Of course it has nothing to do with it being non gmo. But it is unhealthy. 
Hang on, are you telling me american labels don't have a per-100g or equivalent standard measure?

> In theory, sure it's great to remove GMO's

Why?


Why would you say its great to get rid of gmos?
i dont know why we fail as a society (mostly the medias failure) to bring these issues up to the general public in a way where they can better judge the risks and rewards of things like labeling everything. i didnt know about this. im sure people in vermont dont either and their politicians prob would have made a different decision had more people known.
Water is a pure chemical
"pure chemicals in liquid form"
Maybe they should ban Dasani for selling Dihydrogen monoxide, it's used in nuclear(pronounced nuke-u-ler) reactors so it can't be good for us /s
Coke has the same amount of calories and sugar as orange juice.  In fact, read the very label we're discussing and you'll be able to see it for yourself.
> are pure chemicals in liquid form

Have you ever taken a science class in your life? Think of the *chemicals*! Woe is me!
That's true. 

Soda is shit for you. The less of that people drink (even if for paranoid reasons) the better. 

The problem is that logic is a double edged sword. People can do unhealthy thinks for healthy reasoning and actually do serious harm to themselves. 

An example of this is extreme detoxing. Detoxing as an idea is a bit of a mixed truth. Your body detoxes naturally but there are very small things you can do to make that process more efficient (diet, exercise, cutting out inflammatory foods, etc.)

What happens though is people take part in super detox programs where they dehydrate themselves to severe levels (drinking epsom salts for pulling out toxins) or intaking drinks which "detox the liver" but actually cause severe liver inflammation. 

So that is my only worry. The fact this lead to a healthy thing doesn't change the fact people can still use this same train of logic to do unhealthy things for healthy reasons. You get what I mean?
Wouldn't preservatives and developing seeds that can be grown in areas where food is logistically hard to get to, help solve the distribution problem?
Increasing yield reduces emissions.
>Coca Cola apparently doesnt want informed consumers.

And what exactly would a label showing transgenic crops made in a lab tell you?  

It's about baseless fear-mongering given no label for natural transgenic food like sweet potatoes or mutagenic crops - crops treated with radiation and chemicals to increase number of chromosomes - yet are sold as organic. 
https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/mandatory-labels-on-foods-containing-dna-80-of-americans-support-that-011915.html


Except that the requirement for a label is to imply that GMO products are dangerous.  GMO opponents are remarkably similiar to antivaxxers.


I love how you mock people who drink soft drinks in the same sentence you say the whole state are alcoholics.
My favorite Vermont soft drink is Switchback ale.
This is a much better way to explain it and thanks for your comment.  A key principle of an absolute free market is what is known as "perfect information."   Obviously, that's not going to ever be true, but regulation to provide information to consumers is not a bad things.

The reason people hate libertarians is because they think we're against *all* regulation.  Consumer information is the very last thing that we'd ever be against.

Because seedless fruits are so good that we, as a species, don't deserve them.
Probably the same reason stupid people can pass laws like this while ignoring the science.
Are you trying to say that drinking lots of Coke is good for you?
Go drink it :)
I don't see any facts just a claim that orange juice (which some may consider good) may contain equal amount of sugar. I don't know if most commercially available orange juices are good for you either.
So basically you're agreeing with me and just need a better definition of the loosely used word 'chemicals'? 
Oh for sure. I don't like fad health trends that aren't based in science. Sort of a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut thing here. 
It would help, but tbh most companies/organizations don't help out ANYONE unless it helps them out first, so any company that develops those seeds, like Monsanto, would probably patent them and fuck over any 3rd world farmers that might have the idea of recycling those seeds instead of buying them from Monsanto every season.
Then why dont they display the GMO label proudly?

If we have nothing to worry with GMO, then who cares?

Banning Coke would be a blow to those who want clean toilets.
Likes of Organic Consumers Association who are a force behind pushing GMO labelling are [anti-vaxxers](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/breaking-courts-discreetly-confirm-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism) and even suggest [diabetics stop using insulin](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/genetically-engineered-insulins-side-effects) because it contains GMO ingredients.


[deleted]
Should be
Seedless fruits aren't really GMO. Oranges are made by planting only clones so they can't fertilize (self-incompatibility genes) but still bear fruit, bananas are made by asexual propagation sort of like oranges, but once the fruit has matured, shoots are cut from the base and replanted, making a clone that itself will asexually propagate. 

Watermelons are made by treating normal diploid (2 sets of chromosomes, like people) ones with colchicine which doubles their chromosome count making them tetraploid (4 sets, plants can naturally double their chromosome count so this isn't weird). These tetraploid (4n) are then crossed with a normal diploid (2n) making a sterile triploid (3n). Since there is an odd number of chromosomes, they can't combine properly and seeds are rare.
No, I'm pointing out that screaming "Chemikurls!!!" makes you sound dumb as hell
You can't possibly be serious.  You want me to google nutritional facts and give you links to coca-cola and simply orange (or tropicana or any other orange juice)?  Sorry, you're just a couple google searches away from those links.

Again:  Orange Juice and Coca-Cola have the same amount of calories and Orange Juice has about 2 or 3 less grams of sugar per serving.  This is plainly visible on the nutrition label and on the respective websites.  If you want to dispute that claim, have at it.
No, he's ridiculing you for your foolishness and outright stupidity.  Middle School students would look at you quizzically at your statement at sheer disbelief that an adult could be so ignorant. You can continue trying to sound like you understand what you are talking about, but will almost certainly end up proving your ignorance beyond any reasonable doubt. 
There's nothing inherently wrong with a company profiting from its work. If people could buy one crop of seeds and then just plant from what they grow in perpetuity there would be no reason for the company to invest lots of money in developing the product. To be sure, there has to be a balance struck. But I have no issue with a company devoting resources to a project and then attempting to profit from that work. If we don't like it, we should fund government research. 
This is what happens when you get all your news from Reddit.

Monsanto has done both good and bad things.  You are trying to make them out as some evil mustache-twirling entity.

Companies like Monsanto have a vested interest in reducing costs because it allows them to increase profits.  You can't complain about investing in technology to reduce costs *and* complain about increasing profits.

You can have one, but not both.
Because the label is intended to imply that the product is dangerous. 


We should also label products containing Dihydrogen Monoxide. 
Because labelling is about fear not information.  Introduce labelling and anti-GMO groups will claim "Look out for this label, it causes cancer and kills" (despite not a single verified case of causing either).

When I asked Right to Know if they would be in favour of a label that shows the breeding technique used like radiation in organic, mutagenic crops, I was swiftly blocked and similar organisations have all done the same since their arguments can only exist in echo chambers where no one to dispute it.

It's certainly not a reason to ban Coke.  I've drunk the stuff in excess and put on weight but that's my responsibility and mine alone.
Your post implied people over 21 exclusively drink craft beers.
The screaming and the explicit assumption as to what I mean by chemicals was entirely your own creation. 
Nah, googling for facts is hard. May be if we had like a better labeling system both of us wouldn't have to do anything? :) 
So you're basically agreeing with me too? 
I agree with you a company should be able to profit, but in the specific [seed recycling issues](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/business/18seed.html) I was talking about, until their patent expires and another company can make a competitive product then  they can continue to dominate that market, effectively creating a monopoly. Also yes, I believe there should be more government funded research towards this end.
I didn't specifically call out Monsanto because they're "THE" evil corporation, just the only biotech company that produces GMO seeds that came to mind.

I have no doubt they've done good things, the parent comment talks about how we NEED GMO foods to sustain a world population of this size and I can agree with that without discounting Monsanto's contribution, though again, they aren't entirely without their faults.

They're desire to maximize profits is like any other corporations, and just like any other corporation they have consequences on those they affect, like 3rd world and domestic farmers.

And fuck off with that "all yours news from Reddit" while you're in the news section of Reddit.
It's on every label on every can of coca-cola and every can of orange juice already.  What more do you want?
No, I'm continuing to ridicule your stupidity.  See, ridicule is a term which means I'm making fun of you and any statement you are making as not being worthy of considering seriously.  
There are no monopolies in the seed business.

Seed saving went out in the 1930s with the introduction of hybrids.
You seem simply underinformed.  Monsanto invests in a *TON* of companies that have nothing to do with GMOs.  A good friend of mine is a CxO at a company designed to save water for famers that Monsanto is heavily invested in.

So again, when you get all of your news from Reddit, your opinion is likely to be a bit skewed.  You don't hear things like "Monsanto saved 650 million gallons of water last year by investing in new technology.
obviously not, you continue to reply
Where are you getting that information from? 

Just Monsanto and DuPont [control more than 50% seed market share in the United States](http://agrimarketing.com/s/97703) 

The seeds that Monsanto created are genetically modified to be resistant to their own brand of pesticide (Glyphosate) the most commonly used pesticide in the United States, and in other countries as well.

So you have farmers paying the same company for the seeds and the pesticide.
You seem biased. Don't call me uninformed when you're using anecdotal evidence to claim a company that helps farmers save some money does no wrong.
Since I don't think you are special needs or have mental incapacitation, I have no problem simply mocking you every time you  respond.  Your stupidity is such that I don't even feel uncomfortable picking on you like this. You happily bring it on yourself. 
You understand that you are proving my point?  Or is it you don't understand what the term "monopoly" means?

Second, glyphosate were off patent 16 years ago and Roundup Ready corn and soy are also off patent.

Maybe you don't realize that every major seed company has GM crops resistant to proprietary pesticides?  Maybe you don't know there are non-GM crops resistant to glyphosate.

In fact there is probably no limit to what you don't know on this issue.
I didn't call you uninformed.  I called you underinformed.  I also explicitly said that they did wrong.  So who is the biased one?
Might as well have, but thank you for trying to inform me with information on how since your buddy works for a Monsanto owned company that they're just the misunderstood kid on the block and not so bad after all.


If you can't see the bias you're showing not only towards the topic but towards me personally, calling me underinformed, insinuating that I get all my news from Reddit, hell you typecast-ed me from your very first comment, then there is no point in a discussion.
Those flavors sound disgusting. 

Ginger and lime flavored cola?
Article looks more like an ad for their new flavors than any kind of news.
I'll stick with tap water, thank you.
New Coke 2: Electric Boogaloo!
Bigger than New Coke?
Diet Coke is gross, so it makes sense to make it taste like something else. Coke Zero is a great way tame trash whiskey. 
>The company is introducing four new flavours:  Diet Coke Ginger Lime, Diet Coke Feisty Cherry, Diet Coke Zesty Blood Orange and Diet Coke Twisted Mango.


Sounds gross. I don't drink soda anyway. I don't think this will help them boost sales either. Reminds me of Crystal Clear Pepsi

Cherry flavoured coke, that's a fucking great idea!
i don't know anybody who drinks that fizzgoo .. unless they are making a rum and coke.  And that's even pretty gross.  It's beer, water, ice tea .. all those soft drinks are too damn sweet.

These flavors would be interesting if they weren't just "cola enhanced" flavors.

I love ginger ale...with a shot of lime I'd be thinking Moscow Mule. But with diet coke as the base, I don't know.

They're basically just begging to be mixed with alcohol. Too bad they are all diet, redbull made the same mistake.
Because there are these things called opinions. 
The trend is away from soda pop.  
Trends go up and down. However I concede people are being more balanced with them of late, but just like one has to be with the ones you mentioned. 
Soda sales are down basically across the board except Sprite surprisingly. The new money makers are energy drinks and water. Monster and Smart Water do big numbers as well as Dasani too which is filtered tap water
> Lawyer Kathleen Sullivan argued the name and label met Food and Drug Administration approval and “we don’t think that consumers are quite as unintelligent as Pom must think they are.”

1. The FDA should clarify ambiguous definitions, not redefine reality. If something is not pomegranate juice then you should not call it pomegranate juice, regardless of whether the FDA thinks that makes sense or not.

2. There is nothing _unintelligent_ about speaking literally. If a person believes a word means what it means, he is showing his intelligence, not the reverse.
If you really pay attention, most juice is mostly apple juice-  Next time take a peek of those ingredients in that "Cran-Grape" drink you are drinking.
I just bought a bottle of this. How the fuck was I supposed to know it was 99% apple juice.  It just lists "Apples" as the first ingredient.  It only says "100% juice" nothing about how the percentage is split up between the fruits.  Btw I did go to college for 4 years and graduated, so fuck you Kathleen!
Yeah, it should be illegal to market something that is predominately something else. 
what about coke without coke in it?
Here's the solution to all the shenanigans by coca cola, pepsi co, dole, del monte, sunkist, welches (biggest aholes imo because they started this), and name-yer-fav-juice-company--stop buying from them.  Ban them. F*ck them.

They all do this kind of thing now.  I was at a grocery and looked at the ingredients of ALL mass mkt juices and they all have taint ingredients in them like apple, pear juice.  And they taste hella bad.  Every one. It should have been made illegal a long long long time ago but it hasn't because our system does not have the avg citizen's interests in mind--it only kowtows to industry.

So the only way to fight it is to ban every single one of them.  If any one of their products is tainted, you refuse to buy *anything* from that company.  Give your money instead to the company whose products are what they say they are.  100% carrot juice?  we'll take it.

A consumer in this society has only one political power left, and it's the power of the purse and wallet. So if you want to effect a change, you have to withhold your money and send a message; because commerce is your last free speech and refusing commerce sends as much a message as your purchases.
Well...at least the Supreme Court got THIS ruling correct. Maybe next time they'll get the campaign finance and other important rulings right. 

Won't hold my breath...
I wonder what the overall litigation costs have been just to obtain this preliminary ruling.  The parties now have to go litigate over the actual merits of the case.  It's kind of preposterous that at least 3 courts (including the highest court of the US) will have presided over the case before even going to the merits of the false advertising claims.

As an aside, does anyone know why this wasn't pursued under Section 52 of the Federal Trade Commission Act?
This title is not in the article. It says Pomegranate and Blueberry constitute 0.3% and 0.2% respectively and that the whole mix contains 5 juices (Pomegranate, Blueberry, Apple, Grape and a 5th that isn't mentioned.)

The issue is that over 99% of the contents aren't what the label implies, not that 99% is apple juice (something that isn't established in the article).
Lies, Damn Lies, Statistics, and Corporate Marketing. 
If only we could get a major beverage company to challenge policy about things that **really** matter: political bribery, gerrymandering, mass surveillance, bank fraud... 
I hate law suits but not as much as I hate lying pieces of crap companies. 
I don't get why anyone buys from a company that flat out murders people. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Coca-Cola
I love 100 percent juice were just not say what kinds its made of certainly not the kind listed on the front of the container.

Grape 100 percent juice 1 percent grape 99 percent apple congrats you just paid grape price for apple.

Remember when the DA would arrest you for theft by deception. Peperridge farms does.
Food makers already put the ingredients on the back of their product in the order of which they contain the most and least, and I never buy a juice which lists "water" or "apple juice" as the first ingredient if I'm paying a premium for it.  

That said, I have to wonder if Coke listed the first ingredient as apple juice.  Even if they did, if it's 99% apple juice, and pomegranate is listed second, that would be deceptive because nobody would expect that second ingredient to make up only 0.3% of the product, especially when it was so prominently featured on the label.

Perhaps its time for the FDA to require companies to list the actual percentage of each ingredient on the label.  Then see how consumers react when they see things like: "water (50%), sugar (35%), apple juice concentrate (5%)"
Can the FDA be sued for allowing this level of deception?
*"Lower courts agreed with the company that Congress had given the Food and Drug Administration final say over the labeling."*

That was a dark, dark, day in Congress my friends.
What about consumers who bought this crap? Can a class action lawsuit not be utilized for all those who were falsely advertised to?
Next up: Pumpkin Pie filling brands that use butternut squash. 
They should look at "Truffle Oil" then.
"You promised me dog or higher!"
Anyone who cares about GMO labeling should be more than interested in this label.

I personally have never talked to someone who was against GMO who knew the basics about genetics but maybe it will give them something better to do with their time.

Sounds like he's lost some money there...

It's a good thing. If I could ask the POTUS a question it would be:

###WHY THE FUCK isn't there a federal requirement for sugar labelling in the US? PEOPLE ARE DYING and companies do their utmost to convince them to buy their shit and rewire their brains. Sugar is addictive and it can be sold as "a low fat heart healthy food that's good for an active lifestyle". PUT MASSIVE WARNING LABELS ON ANYTHING WITH > n% sugar, IT'S A PERCENTAGE, UNIFORMLY APPLICABLE.
99% apple juice? Don't believe it
They cant really be sued, they do say "blend of 5", and pomegranate *flavour*. Its like the difference between strawberry yoghurt and strawberry *flavoured* yoghurt. If it says strawberry *flavoured*, it only needs to taste of strawberries, and doesnt need to contain them. However, if it says just "*Strawberry Yoghurt*", then they have to use real strawberries, either for the flavouring or put pieces of strawberry in he yoghurt,  otherwise it's considered false advertising.

Seeing as they label the product, and I qupte from the article, "Pomegranate Blueberry *Flavored* Blend of Five Juices", the claim against Coca-Cola is a false claim, and, therefore, Coca-Cola cannot be sued.
So, the label contains 99% apple juice?
[deleted]
But they can't be sued for the essentially poisonous, addictive substance called Coca-Cola.
Wait how is POM suing coke? This hasn't been addressed. Does POM literally own all worldwide distribution use and so forth of an entire fruit? That makes no sense..

I mean POM makes some pretty shitty juice that is more expensive than any other juice I've ever, ever seen, in the history of juices.
I liked his reply:

>Kennedy shot back: “Don’t make me feel bad, because I thought this was pomegranate juice.”

Ouch, not getting the justice on your side there.
Agreed, that's an idiotic argument. If something is advertised as "pomegranate juice" when it's actually flavored apple juice, that seems obviously fraudulent and deceptive.

What's the point of having false advertising laws if they don't apply to products plainly called something other than what they are?

On a side note, I think the fact that ~~foot~~ food technology has progressed to the point where people can buy cheap apple juice that tastes like expensive pomegranate juice is wonderful. It should be still be labeled as "apple juice" though.

Edit: Seriously folks, don't drink foot.
I like this reply especially the second one.
> ambiguous definitions, not redefine reality. 
> 
> There is nothing unintelligent about speaking literally. If a person believes a word means what it means, he is showing his intelligence, not the reverse.

Business try to redefine words and reality to extremes to justify their products.   I know many people that do the same thing to justify their actions.  (I'm not a thief, I only steal small stuff).  I'm glad to see this case.  I'm getting tired of companies doing this.

Yes! And as someone who is allergic to apple and grape, it's very frustrating. I have to check everything. Strawberry banana juice? Nope. First 2 ingredients are apple and grape. Anything any fruit flavor usually is mostly apple and grape. It makes it hard to eat anything fruit flavored when restaurants don't have the ingredients available and most people don't believe me when I tell them things like no, I can't have that raspberry ice cream. Probably has apple or grape in it. I am stuck with orange juice, cranberry cocktail, and kool-aid.
Straight cranberry juice isn't nearly as sweet.  I think a lot people are surprised trying it if they've only had one of the various cran-whatevers before that.
I do, that's why I only buy actual juice.  This would be more like if my orange juice that says "not from concentrate" turned out to be 99% concentrate and they were somehow referring to that 1%.
I've actually been going through this for the last three years... you want some white cran peach juice? Sorry, it's fucking apple/grape juice. And probably corn syrup, too. Auugh! So frustrating.

Edit: Since I'm complaining, more than half of Breyer's products are not ice cream, they're "dairy dessert" or somesuch. Some of us are old enough to remember when [Breyer's ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWB2T_dDuUA) boasted about how the products were made from simple, natural ingredients. I didn't bother looking at the ingredients, I just went to the next brand that sold *actual ice cream*, and the container was a quarter of a quart larger for the same price, too. 
Yeah I looked at a container of grapefruit juice and it said something like apple, pear, plum and a bunch of other random juices. 
Agreed... you always have to read the label... most juices are either apple or grape juice with flavoring added in. You have to look if you want 100% the actual juice you're trying to buy.
Worse yet is that you have to filter through the choices to find something that isn't mostly sugar water to begin with.
You really shouldn't drink juice anyway - it's horrible for your teeth and just another sugary junk food. It's always better to just go to the source -- at least until they start making actual pomegranates out apples.
If it lists apple juice or water as the first ingredient, that's your first hint that they're being cheap with the ingredients.  Though how cheap, in this case, is indeed shocking.
Well then, the [whole country](http://www.libertystatepark.com/emma.htm) would be fucked.


I believe coke does have ingredients derived from the cocoa plant.
Thank you. We empower these corporations and complain to death about them but never utilize our power that is even greater than the power to vote ... boycott.

People are too complacent to even boycott which literally involves doing nothing. How fucked are we when people won't even inconvenience themselves to assert their power over corporations? I boycott all kinds of products and services.
[deleted]
I'm shocked they didn't say it was Coke's "Freedom of speech" to lie.
What surprises me is that this made it to the supreme court. There are much more important cases that they should be ruling on, and this is a waste of the legal system's time.
Just because you disagree with their rulings on campaign finance doesn't mean they are wrong.
>Maybe next time they'll get the campaign finance and other important rulings right. 

>Won't hold my breath...

The turnaround might come sooner than you think if a Democratic candidate wins the next two elections. Citizens United for example was only a 5-4 ruling with the 5 conservatives being appointed by Republicans and 3/4 of the liberals being appointed by Democrats. If we have another 8 years with a Democrat in office, we'll have a liberal dominated Supreme Court for a few decades. Unfortunately, [liberals have a long history](http://nyti.ms/1pAiMMK) of not caring who is appointed to the Supreme Court. Maybe the next few years will be different.
Not sure, but I think the Federal Trade Commission Act establishes the authority of the government (FTC, that is) to pursue actions against companies for their actions, like false advertising in Sec 52. 

Meanwhile, the Lanham Act is the tort law that allows one company (POM) to sue another (Coca-Cola) for damages for misrepresentation. 
It's absurd that our legal system works this way.  A lawsuit to determine if they have standing to bring a lawsuit?  What next, a third lawsuit to determine if they have standing to bring the second lawsuit to get the first suit dismissed?
It is 99.4% apple and grape juice. Sorry for forgetting the grape part. The fifth juice is Raspberry.

> WHY THE FUCK isn't there a federal requirement for sugar labelling in the US?

The number of grams of sugar per serving seems to be on the nutrition labels of virtually all packaged food products that I look at. So I think there probably already is such a requirement.
"it will just cause confusion in the marketplace"  - why we can't have genetically modified food labeled as such.
...Except that the highest court in the U.S. just ruled unanimously that they CAN indeed be sued. 

POM is suing under the Lanham Act, which allows entities to sue one another for damages based on a "misleading representation of fact, which... misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities." 

The court is basically saying that even if a company follows the letter of the law in FDA labeling requirements, it's not exempt from being sued under the Lanham Act. 
Not just the generic drug companies.
In the simplest terms, POM is basically saying to Coca-Cola: "We sell real pomegranate juice. You SAY you sell pomegranate juice but you really don't. People are buying yours instead of ours because you're lying. We incur damages as a result of your lie, so we're suing you." 
Having never purchased Pom and only seen it in stores, why the fuck would I not think this was pomegranate juice? POM is clearly referencing the word "Pomegranate"
I always hated it because I thought it never tasted like pomegranates. Same with orange juice. Come to find out they're both out of flavor packets. 
>  I think the fact that foot technology has progressed 

Advanced foot technology really gives the drink some sole. So don't be a heel and toe the line, embrace foot technology!

(I'll just show myself out)
How much percentage should it be to declare it pomegranate juice? 50%? 90%?
He probably thought the check cleared.. heh heh heh
There was a law in EU that you're only allowed to label using top 3 fruit contents, then it was amended to must be all or none or something.

###MOST IMPORTANT THING - LAW MAKERS ARE GREEDY, LAZY AND STUPID.
Damn that sucks, it could be worse though, you could be allergic to corn syrup.....
Whoa, the food industry really screwed you on that one... being allergic to the cheaper fruit ingredients available to manufacturers really does suck.
Sue. Seriously, cmon obi wan you are our only hope
And I'll bet ya those apples came from China.
Cranberry cocktail is goddamn delicious though. 
There's always fruit infused water.  You're probably better off in some ways - juice is terrible for you and it means you are a lot more cognizant of what you are putting in your body - most of us shovel so much crap in our bodies without thinking twice
If that raspberry ice cream was artificially flavored, you probably didn't want it anyway. Artificial raspberry flavoring comes from the dried perineal (anal) glands of a beaver (castoreum).
it kind of tastes like after vomit

100% blueberry juice however is delicious and does almost everything pure cranberry juice does. Including be hideously expensive
New Cran-Beet and Cran-Cane! Guess what the extra ingredients are?!

> 90+% of Americans (and redditors) probably don't know how sugar is refined, the sources and types, and what the plants look like (or what they are related to). It's fascinating stuff
I can't even find 100% cranberry juice anywhere, it's bullshit, I want to try it.
Cran-grape juice is pretty often actual 100 percent juice. Just 90 percent of it is pear or apple juice.
Mmm... lottery juice... think I'll grab one now lol...
The problem is that at 1% conc. thy probably aren't getting the flavor.
they're wrong
Jeez...there is always a fucking loser like you.
On the other hand, if Ginsburg continues with her selfish idealism and doesn't retire in time to let Obama pick her replacement, and the GOP wins in 2016, we're in for a very very bad 21st century.
Dude your numbers hurt my face--and none of that politicrap matters anyway. We're dealing with dicks, pussies and assholes here.

I banned all juices and juice companies a long time ago and now I'm a proud owner of a juicer.  If i am lazy and really want real juice, I'll pay primo for the organic stuff that doesn't try to fool me with appajuice cuz i aint no sucka.
Yes, this makes perfect sense! Thanks!
It's easy to deride this lawsuit as procedure gone amock, but the procedures that allowed it actually save time in general. If courts conclude that party A can't sue because of standing, they can resolve lawsuits without wasting time on drawn out trials. Sometimes they get appealed, but that's rare (e.g. the Supreme Court accepts less than 100 cases a year).
[deleted]
Tears of 3-legged orphaned puppies.
> There are advocacy groups for that. 

Then why did it take a lawsuit from Pespico to bring about this ruling?
Only because there are many people who create dangerous (sometimes fatal) situations, for others around them,where they benefit from lawsuits, or just plain benefit from law suits when they are faking injury which distorts and affects a system that is meant to be about compensating folks when they have been genuinely wronged.

And then there is the aspect that paper pushers and bullies (people in the legal system like lawyers etc) who expect to gain 30 or more percent after trying to get as much money as possible (not just for their clients but for themselves as the more the client gets the more they get). We would be smart to give lawyers a standard fee regardless of the claim amount and see how many layers will quit the business; we will then see who is doing it for 'justice'.

So what's it to me? Higher insurance fees for everyone, higher possibility that although I'm a safe driver that some fuckhead will hit me on purpose because they want money and just a general fuckupedness that affects various industries, in one way or another, which affects all of us.   
Why (capitalization) ...food, labeled as such? (not a period)
Sorry, was going by English Law.

Also, you're telling me they're going to sue coca cola for correctly labelling their product?

You say POM are suing because of the Lanham Act saying they can if the product "misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities." 

The nature of the product: It is a pomegranate flavoured Juice. *flavoured*. Does not need to contain pomegranate.
Characteristics: It contains Pomegranate, and is a blend of 5 fruits. It states this in the title pf the product, no problem there.
Qualities: Meant to taste like a *blend of 5 fruits*. It tastes like a blend of 5 fruits, because it is a blend of 5 fruits.
Geographic Origin: It's fruit, doesnt really matter what country it's grown in.

It isnt a misleading representation. They say pomegranate *flavored*, that means it only has to taste of pomegranate, it isnt false advertising, if people actually knew what false advertising was and the difference between "Pomegranate Juice" and "Pomegranate *Flavored* Juice", this whole lawsuit wouldnt be happening. It isnt misleading
Also, if they're saying hey can sue even if it follows EVERY FDA regulation, whats the point of having the FDA regulations? They're able to be sued whether they follow the rules or not, so why have the rules in the first place?
Oh the article I read said Generic companies. Either way it's bullshit. The article was about a girl who had gotten prescribed a topical cream and it started eating away her skin. Originally the SC ruled in her favor and she got a settlement but then they later changed their minds, or something along those lines. It was almost a year ago that I read it.
Hahahahahaha, proof that the system really is garbage. Pom is horrible, that's why people aren't buying it. Ten bucks for a litre of juice? 

No thanks -sincerely

-The entirety of society
POM is pomegranate juice. It's Coca-Cola's product "Pomegranate-Blueberry Blend" that is at question here. Coca-Cola's "Pomegranate-Blueberry Blend" is 99.4% apple and grape juice. 

POM wants to sue Coca-Cola because they are calling a product a "Pomegranate-Blueberry Blend" when it contains almost no Pomegranate or Blueberry juice.

Edit: Extra word and typo
Re-read the article POM is pomegranate juice, they are suing Minute Maid subsidiary of Coca Cola for mislabeling. The justice was talking to the Coca Cola lawyer in reference to the Minute Maid pomegranate and blueberry product.
It's foot! It's foot! All the juice is foot! MINUTE MAID LIED TO US ALL!!!
Probably 50%, because if something is Pomegranate Juice, the majority of its contents should agree with its labeling.
"Must include in order at least top three juices used, and clearly state percentages"

> Would become "Apple, Pomegranate and Blueberry Juice!!!!" (98%, 1%, 1%)

So then you'd have to go further with the laws, but then they'd come up with something like, we want to make it Grape and Mint flavor, but mint only constitutes 0.01% yadda yadda, that's why these fucking cunts get all the money, so then these fat sweaty stupid and diabetic law makers break for lunch and nothing gets done.

Fuckers.
or a yellow/red dye.
It was already stated in that very thread that it isn't likely because it's fairly expensive to extract castoreum. It CAN be used, but isn't normally since there are cheaper alternatives. 
>it kind of tastes like after vomit

I'm so glad to see someone finally say this.
I once got SUPER drunk on cranberry vodkas drinking with my dad and his alcoholic friends. I puked for like an hour. So cranberry juice DEFINITELY tastes like vomit to me.
Your comment will likely be removed if it: a) is racist, bigoted, vitriolic, etc. b) is gratuitously provocative or disturbing, or c) breaks on of the other rules listed in the sidebar. Extreme or repeast offenders will be banned.

Nice argument! That'll win 'em over.
Citizens united was the right ruling

Even the ACLU agrees
the moment you allow the government to silence one form of campaign support you give them the right to silence you.

campaign finance reform was never about protecting our rights, it was only about protecting incumbents and those they select to join them.
Too bad you aren't a Supreme Court justice eh?
How does that work? 

I bought a juicer a while back and everything through it tastes like... dirt, I've tried organic, I've tried peeling, etc it just doesn't taste right, even versus the 100% organic juice stuff.

Regulatory compliance and tort law are really different from one another. 

Following regulations will assure you don't get fined (or shut down, etc) by the government. 

But, this compliance only goes so far. If your company behaves in deceptive or predatory practices, you can certainly be sued by your competitors. 

Also, consider that the Lanham Act actually has two primary components, labeled A and B below. I had referred to B in the original post, because it specifically pertains to commercial advertising and promotion, but both are relevant. Here's the Lanham Act text: 

>Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any >container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or >device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false >or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of >fact, which—

>(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the >affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or >as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or >commercial activities by another person, or

>(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, >characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another >person’s goods, services, or commercial activities,
>shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is >or is likely to be damaged by such act.

This language encompasses issues like likelihood of confusion, which I have to guess are part of POM's allegation (although I have not read their petition). 

Finally, it's really important to note that SCOTUS has NOT ruled on the merits of the case. So, as of yet, neither side has won or lost. All we know is that the case won't be summarily dismissed; this decision validated POM's right to bring suit. 
This is common practice in the juice industry.  Try finding cranberry juice at a supermarket.   Even ocean spray who markets cranberries endlessly on TV put mostly apple juice in its "cranberry juice.  100% juice" product.
I think the worst part of Soylent Green is that they didn't give you a choice, leg or breast.
At the very least pomegranate juice needs to be the juice that makes up the largest percent.

They claimed it was a blend of 5 juices, each juice should have at least been between 10-30% with pomegranate juice being the largest percent out of any of the juices because they labeled he front as if it was the main ingredient.
With that particular drink it would be apple, grape and raspberry.
Thanks, I missed that. It's still on my list of ingredients to avoid and I still run into it in products at the grocery. Admittedly, I do have a penchant for raspberries. Not a big fan of artificial raspberry flavoring either (or many artificial flavorings, in general). Raspberries are just so darn good on their own.  
Agreed. Straight Cran-juice is awful. I honestly don't even like the Cran-apple juice, either.
But what about the people who do buy it expecting it to taste like what's on the label?
I would encourage everyone [to actually read *Citizens United* before](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf) forming an opinion. If you're going to have a strong opinion, be well informed.
I don't see how the ACLU's position is super binding on this one, they are in favor of individual rights, by giving those rights to a company it dilutes the individuals rights.

The Supreme Court isn't always right.
>If I was arrested, I wouldn't get a trial beforehand to determine if the arrest was proper before I got a trial to determine if I was guilty.

Actually you might. A grand jury might be convened to determine if charges should be filed, depending on your state and the severity of the crime.
> You bring a law suit when you are affected by something in a negative way. 

If someone sells me an apple and it's actually an orange, i am affected in a negative way. 
Wow, that was a really clear explanation. I actually have no clue about American law, my judgments and assumptions were going off of English law (I'm English)
Then they'll just stick 50 different juices in it so they have an excuse to only use 3% pomegranate.
Yeah that's right.
Most people have no idea what its supposed to taste like. 
but the majority is the law of the land. 
If they truly use 50 different juices that are real juices, I will allow it.

"Pomegranate and stuff!"
Juice cocktail W/ 3% pomegranate would be a good label for that.

You know it's bad when McDonald's thinks you did something tasteless. 
That's some fancy ass-covering lipservice, but neither of them will drop their sponsorships. They just want to "Be on the right side".
Which is weird, because "Sepp Blatter" sounds like a medical condition you'd get from consuming too much Coke.
It's so crazy how earlier in the year he said he was resigning, and the world collectively rejoiced, but then he says he's reconsidering the resignation, and suddenly everyone dropped the story. What the hell happened?
The only reason why they ask for Blatter's resignation now is because it's good money to be anti Blatter. It's just a whole load of PR. Don't think they were ever unaware of FIFA's or Blatter's actions. Hell, I doubt they will even change their policies. They'll just say they're anti Blatter, and continue to do what they do. 
I need John Oliver to do all the things he said he would. FIRE BLATHER!

If every sponsor dropped out overnight he'd be gone by morning, but they won't. This is lip service given Blatter has proven time and time again that he doesn't give the tiniest of shits what anyone thinks about him. 
Of course. Still better than nothing.

>It should be noted that the girl, Anais Fournier, had a heart condition, called mitral valve prolapse -- which means that one of her heart valves has malfunctioned.

Mmhm.
Wow, most saturdays during college I drank enough monster to kill a 14 year old girl.
Considering that two mega monsters (24 oz size she drank) is six servings it isn't surprising.

At an ounce to ounce comparison it puts the monster at three and a quarter times the caffeine per unit volume as coca cola. This still puts the energy drink at a lower caffeine content than most coffee. 
>The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally, is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats. The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass or roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult.
Oh god. Here we go. Countless politicians and outraged parents bitching about it and demanding you need an 18+ ID to buy them (Or alternatively ban them). 

Have fun america.
I really hate these headlines. No headline should ever say "girl dies **after** drinking 2 energy drinks". If it's *caused* by the energy drinks, it should say "dies from drinking 2 energy drinks". If it's not, or we don't know, it should not mention them. Fear mongering.
I came in here to expound.  I'm rather anti-caffeine.

But on reading the comments, great googly-moogly!  What a sensationalized headline!

Sure, 14 cans of coke.  **Or 3 cups of coffee.**

Bah, total non-issue that only serves to muddy the waters in the conversation about giving kids stimulants.
[Death by caffeine](http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine)
what a total bunch of horse shit.  she would have broken down or peed out the majority of the caffeine from the first drink in a few hours.  why does anyone fucking bother reading the huffington post.  this is the same site that allowed jenny fucking mccarthey to say vaccines cause autism.
It is too bad she passed but, I believe the most important line in this article is "It should be noted, she had a heart condition".  
Quick make the government save us!
Good thing pot is illegal! 
I used to think sugar was harmless. Then I got old. I do think caffeine is more dangerous than we think, because of cardiac and endocrine effects over time, but this is a dumb article.
As a person with mvp, I can tell you first hand that I am very sensitive to caffeine. What is strange about my personal case is that I wasn't diagnosed with mvp until I was in my early 20s and my sensitivity to caffeine wasn't really there until then either. Therefor, I'm obliged to believe the two are very connected. I've always known that if I drank even half a can of a monster drink, it would certainly induce panic attacks and major palpitations, if not worse. I once chugged a coke and ended up in an ambulance for hyperventilating from the panic attack it induced about half an hour later. Everyone is different in their caffeine sensitivity. Still, who the fuck lets their kid drink energy drinks? 
This is a dangerous substance and needs to be immediately criminalized so that no one can have fun anymore.
Time to make everything illegal!!!!!!!!!!
Really awful that this happened to her. on the bright side she saved a lot of lives with her organ donations. still a shame though.

On a side note: Energy drinks are more dangerous than cannabis. FYI

I did this before in college and was convinced I was going to die.
2 in 24hrs, thats like, bare minimum for me a day.

also, heart condition.
I take 4 sips from a regular monster and my acid reflux kicks me in the throat. That stuff makes my heartburn flair so bad, I am so glad I cant drink it. I just take a 5hour energy thing and usually I am awake, stuff tastes bad but its better then heartburn.
 2 24oz is a lot for anyone and at the limit (3 per day on the 16oz cans as listed), and add onto that a heart condition?  It's sad, but I mean.....Shit.

Okay, where are we are now?
You just know American media will blame energy drinks, but where were here parents to stop her drinking two big ass cans of energy drink when she had a heart problem?

BAN PARENTS
Lol. Anais sounds like anus.
Anyone else irked by the mom's "told you so attitude?" It's as if she doesn't want to be blamed.
I suffered from an energy drink addiction for about 2 years, from 15-17. Even during the worst time, I wouldn't drink more than 2 16 ounce cans. This girl would have had to have drank 2 of the 24 oz. Monsters to get the caffeine they're mentioning here.

Two things: The media is stupid. This may have been 2 cans, but it was 6 servings. Huge difference.

This is a parenting issue. Energy drink addiction means you won't be able to function if you don't get a fix. The high is only temporary, and the longer you drink them, the less powerful they become. Also, caffeine intoxication is not an enjoyable experience. Don't let your kids be stupid.

TL;DR Parents are stupid, kids are stupid, media is really stupid, I was stupid.

TL;DR the TL;DR **EVERYONE IS STUPID.**

anything is potentialy dangerous when used in excessive way. People need to stop complaining agaisnt everything and anything. Dont blame the products, blame the kid for lacking of judgement.
I've drank 4 cans of amp in 1 day I'm and I'm still alive. Those have 160 mg of caffeine a can too. 
14 times the amount in a standard can of cola? bullshit. http://www.cspinet.org/new/cafchart.htm
Why doesn't the article say if she knew about the heart condition or not?

The AAP has recommendations for how much caffeine a child should be getting?
A friend of mine in high school drank anywhere from 2 to 6 Red Bulls or Rockstars *per day* for a couple of years. Shockingly, he had a seizure.
I've had 720mg of caffeine today. One little bottle of MIO Energy throughout the day.
How much did she weigh? LD50 for caffeine is around 150mg/kg. It would take over 100 cups of coffee to kill you
Bet it just wasnt her heart that was prolapsed after this
Light weight. 
In other news Cannabis is still illegal and you should continue to blindly purchase poisons sold over the counter.
[deleted]
To bad she had shitty parents, that let her drink those things. Her mom/dad going to get in trouble at all?
To be fair, I have a mitral valve prolapse too (though I am 10 years older than her, it is likely genetic, and has always been there) and it is basically considered benign. My doctor never told me not to drink caffeine or change my lifestyle in any way because of it.

ed: oh yeah, even the article notes it is usually harmless. It is true that it may not have been harmless in this case, but it is *also* true that it may not have affected what happened at all.
I think it should be noted that heart conditions are often unknown at that age. I didn't find out I had anything wrong with my heart until I was 21 and had to spend a week in ICU. 

And really, no one should consume that much caffeine, with or without heart conditions. 

Edit: I want to make it clear that I'm not saying this specific person's condition was unknown. Just that you shouldn't discredit this situation because people exist that are unaware of problems they have. 
The only reason I upvoted this story is so some intelligent readers will see your comment. Stories like these are sad, but not worthy of national news. There are plenty of events going on in the world that need far greater attention by the media. 
Silence, with your justifications - you can tell that energy drinks are dangerous by the club scene and college exam periods.  I can barely get a nonalcoholic club soda or caffeine-free bottled water without wading through a waist-deep drift of corpses.
I knew there was something more to it before I even clicked on the link. 2 energy drinks shouldn't do shit to a 14-year-old.
[deleted]
From the Today article linked:

>The condition, which affects up to 1 in 20 Americans, usually doesn't cause people any problems, and the teenager's doctor felt her case posed little health risk.
New headline: "Girl dies from heart condition."
I interpret that sound as a murmur.

Shit sorry about the pun.
Also, she watched television THREE TIMES in 24 hours. I need no more proof. Killed by TV.
Came here to make sure my skepticism would be backed.  When I was 14 I literally used to drink 2-3 cans of monster a day, I would get hyper as *fuck* but NEVER was it in anyway noticably bad for my health.  8 years later and I'm still a healthy man.
Not to mention a can of monster is huge. Drinking two isn't something you could do accidentally or absent mindedly. Anyways, I'm tired of how overblown headlines are on reddit. "Girl with heart condition dies, she also had two energy drinks, I'll bet it was the drinks that did it and nothing else."
And, it's not like she drank two 8 ounce, or even 12 ounce cans of the stuff. She drank two 24 ounce cans, aka the "tallboy". I'll have to check energyfiend.com later but I'm guessing that they're referring to fourteen 12 ounce cans of coke. Those two cans had the volume equivalent of 4 cans of coke, so we're looking at roughly 4x the caffeine if all the numbers check out. Still a bit high but not OMG 14 times as high!!!!
People that die from being tased have things like that too.

Fuck them and their weak bodies.  Why should regulations protect them from levels of artificial chemicals whose LD50 for a 40kg child is 6 grams?  

She drank 480mg, which is just 8% of an LD50.  It's probably just like radiation -- you go below the LD10 and the effects disappear exponentially and poof, perfectly safe for a billion people to experiement with when they're happy or drunk or being dared by their friends to drink something.

Everyone knows you might die if you drink two 700ml bottles of something bought from the local grocery store.  You need to be more careful.
Well, a 14 year old with a chronic heart condition.
Every day I drink an amount of coffee that would probably kill a very small horse with a heart condition.
I regularly drink a LOT of energy drinks. Sometimes none, usually at least 2 per day, and occasionally a dozen. It killed me the first sip. I'm just kept going by all the evil caffeine. This is how it starts. This is how the world ends.
Right. Two of the 24oz drinks has about as much caffeine as 2 cups of coffee (less, actually), and I guarantee you no one would be freaking out if she had had two cups of coffee within 24 hours of each other.
As a frequent energy drink drinker, I know that most have 80 mg/"serving", or 160 mg per can.  The buffer ones have 240 mg per can.  I can't even tell I'm drinking them.  If I want a buzz, I chug a 24 oz. truck stop coffee with a couple of extra shots.
Get out of here with your logic!
So what you're saying is that my urge to burn every Starbucks I see to the ground is correct...
uh actually it is surprising.

unless you're a silly billy
The only logical conclusion we can draw here is that the girl was 2kg.
**SCIENCE!**

USA: People demand the government get involved shit like this and four loko but god forbid it's "socialist" when the government gets involved in healthcare.
I wish we could just skip to the logical conclusion and lock everybody in padded cells.  For their own safety, of course.
they already ID everyone... it's so stupid. 
Four Loko. 'Nuff said.
Indiana will ban sales of it on sundays.
That shouldn't be an issue though.  Most 14-year-olds don't have jobs to begin with, so obviously the money came from somewhere.  And last I knew, adults are responsible for their children up till a certain age, even if they aren't directly parenting them.  
I find it amusing the Americans don't require "nutritional" information on the products. I don't think banning or restricting access is the proper route, but I do think education is.

Put the info on the can. Put the suggested serving as well. Done, no issue. Anybody wants to keep drinking it is taking their own, informed, risk.
Journalism loves post hoc, ergo propter hoc.
Girl dies after waking up in the morning!  Film at 11.
You are right, but from the Today article:

>The official cause of death, according to the teenager's death certificate, was cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity.

>Sure, 14 cans of coke.  **Or 3 cups of coffee.**

Coffee legislation limiting people to 2 cups a day seems like the only possible solution to this problem. Maybe one just to be safe. OR a ban on caffeine so the black market can control caffeine delivery.
One can of monster down, one-hundred more to go!
It doesn't say whether she knew about the condition.   It does not say if she skipped sleep.  It does not say what her physical activity level was.

I highly doubt the caffeine caused it.  If it triggered anything, she was probably going to drop dead within a week anyways.
From the Today article:

>The official cause of death, according to the teenager's death certificate, was cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity.
Eh, how is caffeine 'fun'? It's useful, yes. But fun?

I remember a couple of years ago, a student overdosed on water. Where's the headline talking about the dangers of drinking water? I'm starting my own group, Parents Against Water (POW) to warn families about the dangers of drinking water. The public needs to know!
Prob came from a single parent (mum) household, and he was something like a Bigbrother/bigsister foundation participant. 
If you add up the amount of caffeine in 2 24oz monsters, it's less than like 3-4 cups of coffee.  Hardly dangerous.  Even for a child.  
It's unwise to exceed that, but not lethally dangerous without a heart condition. You can check how many it would take to kill someone of your weight through caffeine overdosage [here](http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine)
Why?  Just set age limits like everything else that it "bad" for you.  Or just don't drink them if "you have a heart condition".  Or monitor what your kid eats and drinks.  This is poor parenting and should not be taken out on the beverage companies.
Well, they didn't let, she did it anyway.  So, I'd say it's more of a sad story about how teenagers are all too often rebellious and dumb, and much less about the dangers of too much caffeine.  But I guess they all have their points.  

One could possibly argue that the parents were foolish for letting their child go out with friends and no adult supervision at 14yo, but, not me.  When I let my 14yo child go out alone, I'll be worried, but probably about 100+ other things, and not energy drinks.  Of course she doesn't have a known heart condition.  If she did, I'd probably worry about that and energy drinks too.  

Sad story, for sure.  :(








Did you miss her mother's comment, "...I do not allow them because I know they are bad for you."

Unless you shackle your daughter to the bedpost, she's going to be a kid.

It's not uncommon. It's just rare.
Two 24-ounce Monsters = 480mg caffeine
One can of Coke = 35mg caffeine
480/35 ~ 13.7
Are you comparing the damaging effects of caffeine to the damaging effects of cannabis? Because caffeine is to cannabis as cannabis is to alcohol.
I'm sorry you lost your friend, but all this attention surrounding her death, people trying to point the finger and scapegoating, is not going to bring honor to her memory. Her death is being used as leverage by her family to sue a corporation for money. Fact is, she shouldn't have been drinking such an excessive amount of energy drink at her age and with a heart condition. 
Did you read the article? Noooooope.
Because it is not harmful for you doesn't mean it isn't harmful for others.
I was in a similar situation. I didn't find out until I was 23 and was also told the condition was totally benign. Even if her condition was known, this article should still serve as a warning to those who have MVP and drink Monster. 
No one should drink what is equivalent to 3-4 cups of coffee in a 24 hour period?

It could be done as easily as a single 12 ounce mug with breakfast two days in a row.
Why not?

(why not consume that much caffeine, in case someone thinks I was trying to pry into your medical history)
From the article, though:

> But caffeine poisoning is not uncommon in the U.S. TODAY reported that cases of caffeine poisoning have increased over the last few years, from 1,128 in 2005 to 13,114 in 2009. 

In CNN's case, things like a battle over the best bagels (featured on their front page since yesterday). Modern news is just depressingly laughable.
That's the thing about news--what we get is what people respond to, and what sells ad space. (at least the mainstream news sources.)
Remind me NOT to enroll in your dead zombie school.
Should make them a might bit nervous when they drink it, mhmm.
That must have been exacerbated by her heart condition. It shouldn't need saying, but that is *not* a dangerous dosage of caffeine. It's barely 1/50th of one, *at most*.
The simple fact that Monster existed when you we're 14 makes me feel like and old, old man.
I bet I could kill one hundred 14 year old girls with heart conditions.
that 1 in 10 people have.

(according to the article)
[deleted]
Those would be 2 exceptionally strong cups of coffee. Most cups have 100-150mg of caffeine, usually maxing at 200mg. Still agree that although it's certainly a good amount, nowhere near deadly for the average person. If it were, me and most of my friends would have died many times by now.
...Mormon? 
I thought it was that shes a giant rat?
Some Americans don't want the government involved in either.
Not many people demanded it. And not many people demanded they ban the "incense" fake weed stuff. But when you give the government all the power they want the people no longer have a say in what is legal.
For energy drinks? I've never seen or heard of that. 
Is that real? 
They do require nutritional information, including suggested serving size. The two 24oz cans she drank would have been clearly labeled as containing 3 servings apiece. 
Hey that was a West Wing episode!
I understood two of those words! \o/

I think mandatory weekly blood testing for caffeine levels is called for.

I suggest that Homeland Security be in charge of this program.
>limiting people to 2 cups a day

That's fine. We have BIG cups here in Seattle.
Then she must have been using those drinks to wash down handfuls of caffeine pills.
You've never drank coffee recreationally? It can be very fun.

I just read wayy to many depressing things on reddit, so cynical.
forgot about the 24oz cans.... I have been out-mathed :(
I'm comparing the fact that we promote chugging of such ridiculous poisons at concerts, auto events, the beach, even in movies and it is completely fine that you can buy two cans and kill your self, but if you wanna get a gram of some cannabis, WATCHOUT. And to mention alcohol would be another argument, kids can't walk into a store and purchase booze, but Energy drinks? Fuck i remember being a freshman in highschool and they had the Starbucks Espresso Double shots. Real responsible.
Guilty. 
I think the point is that, as the article said, this condition is not rare or heavily accounted for, so the combination of mitral valve prolapse and excessive caffeine is not unlikely enough to just brush off as a special circumstance. 
Human biology is rather consistent.  
Get out of here with your logic!
Ive heard of people dying due to heart conditions, ive never heard of people dying from pure caffeine. One of those tens of thousands of people would have made a much more interesting article.  imo.
From the [wiki article on caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Caffeine_intoxication):

>The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be about *150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram* of body mass or roughly ***80 to 100 cups of coffee*** for an average adult. Though achieving lethal dose with caffeine would be exceptionally difficult with regular coffee, there have been reported deaths from overdosing on caffeine pills, with serious symptoms of overdose requiring hospitalization occurring from as little as **2 grams of caffeine**.

To put that in perspective, a can of soda usually has 35mg of caffeine.  A No-Doz (or any other caffeine pill) has around 200mg.  You'd literally have to eat a handful of caffeine pills to have a chance at hospitalization, let alone death.
I'd put that down to Starbucks rather than energy drinks.
The only difference in today's news is that they now have a better understanding of what their viewers/readers want to know about. 
I don't give a shit about Bagels. Unless it's Pizza Bagels.
Not if you have some of them French fried potatoes.
A mite bit. "Mite" means "A little".
Dude it was only 2002...
.
Cool. The site I was looking at said that Monster had 80mg per 16oz can, but it was probably a different variety of the drink. It also said the average 12oz cup of coffee had 200mg.

>me and most of my friends would have died many times by now.

And most of reddit.
Doctors have used hurtful terms like "pyromaniac".  I like yours better.
They ban the sale of alcohol on sundays.
Do you have anything to back that up? According to the Today article (which this one was taken from), the FDA doesn't regulate caffeine in energy drinks, and the American Beverage Association only has voluntary policies when it comes to issues like nutritional labeling, and marketing energy drinks toward kids
What?
Quam multa rubrum tauros aut monstra esset tibi bibere priusquam Latine loqui copiose et portare in sermone?
It is a very common logical fallacy that seems to be ingrained in human nature. Simply means that "Since one even follows another event, the first event caused the second event". 
Yea I understood "journalism" and "loves", too. Doesn't mean I speak Latin. 
if you add whiskey!
Well, no.

His parable indicated that in his opinion caffeine is just like other "fun" substances...
Cause you can totally get sarcasm out of your post.  Hint, you can't  Sorry for taking it like it came across.
Yes, it is, because those dosages are *harmless* unless she's been doing this regularly for weeks, and this story is absolute *bullshit*. You can't "buy two cans and kill yourself", there's simply not enough caffeine. You'd need about *70* cans to reach the mean lethal dose.
It said *most* people have a mild form of this condition. Just because it's common to have a mild form doesn't mean she didn't have a serious health condition. Benign tumors are really common, but you can't use that to extrapolate that most tumors are inconsequential.
No it isn't. Not at all.

Anyone that studies anatomy and physiology could tell you that it isn't.

Just because its in the textbook and most textbooks have consistent pictures, doesn't mean human anatomy is consistent. 
Note that these are 13,000 cases of caffeine poisoning, not of deaths by caffeine poisoning.

From http://www.negativeeffectsofcaffeine.net :

> Symptoms of caffeine poisoning would most often involve rapid or irregular heartbeat, muscle twitching, convulsions and difficulty in breathing, or feelings of thirst, dizziness, and confusion, or hallucinations. Caffeine poisoning can also cause a loss of consciousness, in some cases leading to death.
Or as this article makes clear, have some sort of pre-existing condition that is exacerbated by caffiene consumption.
Anias consumed only 480 milligrams of caffeine.

With caffeine LD estimation is going to be pretty variable.  It has such a wide range of effects on a person.  Especially people with heart conditions are at a much higher risk.
There's also caffeine powder that you can acquire in europe and mix into drinks. Some dude seriously od'd on that a couple years ago....not going to waste time finding the article... 
Trust me, it's not Starbucks. 
>And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into your kill room. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you

As a homicidal maniac (specializing in 14 year old girls) myself, I can completely confirm this.
If I see an amateur at the local middle school mowing down a hallway of 12 year old girls, I'm going to be a judgemental arsehole.
If I see an amateur stalking the local 9th grade popular girl, actually breaking a sweat, I'm thinking "Good on ya, mate".
This is a reddit antique. 
.. the fuck?
>Cool. The site I was looking at said that Monster had 80mg per 16oz can, but it was probably a different variety of the drink. It also said the average 12oz cup of coffee had 200mg.

A cup is 8 oz not 12, that's why there was confusion about your original post.
Ah, thanks for the clarification.
I was also a bit confused when the Today article said:

>The Food and Drug Administration regulates the amount of caffeine in soda, but not in energy drinks -- the latter are considered a dietary supplement, not a food. But the American Beverage Association says it has adopted voluntary policies when it comes to issues like nutritional labeling, and marketing energy drinks toward kids.

because as far as I can tell, labeling for dietary supplements (energy drinks) should be required as per the [Code of Federal Regulations: Title 21 Food and Drugs: Subpart C: Section 101.36](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title21-vol2/xml/CFR-2008-title21-vol2-part101.xml#seqnum101.36).  Specifically, the part that states:

>(a) The label of a dietary supplement that is offered for sale shall bear nutrition labeling in accordance with this regulation unless an exemption is provided for the product in paragraph (h) of this section.

I'm no expert at this legal mumbo-jumbo though, so I may have missed something.

Well shit, I need 1500lbs in 15 mins to kill my self with cannabis, but that doesn't stop the Gov from ostracizing any of its supporters.
one in ten is not "most"
Human hearts all have the same fundamental structures.  The differences, such as mitral valve prolapse, is not enough to say that the design of the heart is inconsistent.  Mirtal valve prolapse is simply the improper shutting of upper and lower chambers.  This is consistent across all diagnoses.  Can you find me an example of mitral valve prolapse that is NOT the improper shutting of upper and lower chambers?  

Anyone that studies anatomy and physiology could tell you that there are statistically normal consistencies in human phylogeny.    For example, most humans have 2 arms and 2 legs, etc.  When you actually look at the specifics, the vernacular makes it very particular in order to maintain consistencies.  

Humans also have a tendency to apply a dynamic approach to everything; "we are all snowflakes and unique in our own ways, down to our genes".  However, we are all rather similar, actually.
Sounds like a normal morning after a couple cups of joe.
but the title is so SCARY! we have to make it scary! 
It would be pretty expensive to get caffeine poisoning from Starbucks.
I will totally trust you, anonymous internet person with no sources cited.
[Context](http://www.reddit.com/comments/6nz1k/got_six_weeks_try_the_hundred_push_ups_training)
Doing a keyword search, as well as a quick read of that section, it does not appear that caffeine content is required on the label. Perhaps that is what the Today article was referencing?

Just like you, I have no idea. My thoughts were from the article and from word of mouth. I'm from Canada, where labelling is required. I've heard we have more strict requirements, which is the reason certain things need to be repackaged when bought from the US and displayed for sale here.
lol quod?
¿Qué?
Optimum consilium. Tantum fomentis erit tendentia soluere viscera. Est bonum extra iacuit praesidio evolvere stercore receptacula.
As someone that has done human dissection, and is a physiology major, I can tell you that there are a lot of differences in form and its not like the textbook.
A couple, yeah just a couple... hehehe
Exactly. People aren't going to Starbucks and knocking back eight gross and overpriced espresso shots
And 4 dollar energy drinks aren't expensive?
I don't feel like looking up the statistics, but I can be 100% certain that people drink soda more often than they drink monsters, kids especially.
THANKS! I guess I completely missed that one. 
I understand it's not textbook universal, but I trust you understand what I mean by fundamentally consistent.
Challenge accepted. 
Actually the coffee is worse because you would drink more of it.  A 16 oz cup of starbucks coffee has about the same caffeine as 7 cans of soda.  

So you could just drink two of those coffees, and get the same caffeine as this girl did.

This isn't even the 20 oz venti size, drink two of those and you get the equivalent caffeine of drinking 20 cans of soda.
Starbucks is overpriced for sure but there is nothing particularly wrong with their espresso. It is in no way fantastic but 'gross' overstates it just a little. It's a standard espresso. I'd have no problem drinking 8 shots of it. I would have a problem paying to do so.
According to the US Today article, Monster claims the drinks have less caffeine than some Starbucks beverages. I don't know which ones though.
I'd much rather do that at home
These energy drinks cost $2 apiece.  If you get extra shots in your coffee, you might get more caffeine bang for your buck at Starbucks, right?
A can of Monster isn't $4.
As someone who hates memes, I still cherish that one when it pops out of the blue like that. I am a  hypocrite. 
Statistically consistent, sure. I get that. Have you ever heard of the circle of willis? Its in every anatomy textbook ever made basically, but it only exists in about 25-30% of people.
the 24 oz can i just bought was $3.59 this morning, so close enough
Must depend on where you live. Also, we have a 15% sales tax here.

[edit] Also, can recycling fee.
The whole fun thing about memes is when they blindside you and catch you off guard with their wit. Not when they're dangling their dicks in your face and screaming "LOOK AT MEEEEEE". 
I remember reading through that thread in fits of laughter when it happened. Ah, the memories.
To amend what I said earlier, perhaps I should have said; considering the fundamental consistencies of human physiology, it is likely that mitral valve prolapse is not a causal factor.  Agreed?
Monsters have much more caffeine than the vast majority of coffee based beverages from places such as Starbucks. 

Edit: I might be wrong. 
That may just be where you live... I see them for $2.50, or the 4 pack for $8
I bought a Rockstar that came to exactly $4 with tax. The same price as the Monster next to it.

Mine was a 12 oz can.
If you like fizzy water, Topo Chico is the shit.  
I'm looking forward to their Rum & Coke mixer.
Hey, isn't there a South Park episode where Stan tries to return a drink mixer??
If you like mouse puppets, Topo Gigio is the shit.
I used to buy Topo Chico in Austin. I haven't found any since I moved to L.A.

Edit: when I was a kid I had a Topo Gigio doll.
I’ve had the jack Daniels and coke mixer in a can once and it was the most disgusting drink I’ve ever had.
If you're intrigued by existential gunslingers and psychedelic coming of age stories, El Topo is the shit.
Hey, give people a break. Pouring whiskey and Coke in a glass over ice is complicated. Might as well let them pay more per volume than the real deal for the privilege of premix in a can. This is America, remember?
Hey hey hey, don't be so rude to them. It's in a bottle.
They created tumblr and HAES. 

Yeah, I said it. 
With twinkies? The answer is twinkies, isn't it?
>Yeah, I said it.

LOL.  Did you think your comment was brave or unpopular or something?  Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge.
wouldnt surprise me, especially with how many want to blame (food/drink) instead of themselves for their condition 
You know, it wouldn't surprise me if SJW were funded likewise by some institution with some ulterior motives.
How I miss fat people hate 
Its unpopular ofcourse! it isn't laying down and accepting obesity. 
Holy razors edge batman, that was a close shave!
Well then why don't you go to the mall and scream at fat people how worthless you think they are. I mean, if that's how you like to spend your time.
You shitlord! Triggered. Rebloged AND tagged

Well then you are living your dream.
Clearly it was someone who tried Japanese Coke in the tasting room.....
Did they use a Max Headroom voice to make the threat?
if youve never been there you should try the Beverley soda from Italy. The best. 
Ohhhhh, FUCK yeah bud!
What...is a rip?
I don't think that's how language works, meat loaf's lawyers don't get wet every time 1 out of 3 things fails to meet expectations. 

Sooooo... Canada has rappers?
Go for a drive
According to the video he does have a trade mark on the phrase "Out for a Rip"
It's hard to understand it if you only read the headline 
Drake is Canadian.
[Canada has always had rappers](https://youtu.be/B0yGvypBwyA) 
This. It is a trademarked phrase. And just like any business he should be aggressively defending that trademark. Just as Coke would do if anybody was commercially using one of their trademarked slogans. 
If Coca-Cola and Pepsi were smart, they'd sell their syrup *for* SodaStream machines. Save money on shipping and reach more customers at the same time.

Their executives' heads are probably lodged way too far up their own asses to think of such a thing, though. "MUST CRUSH ALL COMPETITORS. CRUSH KILL DESTROY"
CBS is compromised. These recent events just prove it more and more.
I never realized SodaStream was such a big threat to Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
CBS, being a private company, has the right to choose which companies advertise on their network. And in this case, they choose to not allow one company's ad. Your local newspaper, radio station and TV broadcaster all have this same right. No one is forced to do anything. Is it bad business for CBS to reject ads? Perhaps. But CBS has a right to conduct bad business too.
soda stream sodas taste terrible. But it did allow me to carbonate apple juice so that's pretty cool.
These guys own CNET too, woo hoo!
You would think they would explain what the fuck SodaStream is
Can soda stream legally use the brand labels for both coca-cola and pepsi in their ads?
Private companies doing things in the interest of their business.  Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

* Save Money
* Use Less Plastic

I think maybe it's time to invest in a SodaStream. I've always wanted one anyway.
I'm someone who is the epitome of "anti-big corporation", but I don't see anything wrong with this.

When I was in College I worked for a local music store. That music store had other competitors in the area, and we regularly advertised on billboards, as well as newpapers and radio spots.

In each advertising situation the owner of the store would work out a deal where we would gain "exclusive advertising rights" for our medium with the advertising outlets. This essentially meant that no other music stores would be allowed to advertise as long as we were advertising in those outlets.

In some cases we paid a higher rate, in other cases we provided hefty discounts to employees of the companies we paid for advertising from, or provided services to the companies we worked with. We set it up where it was mutually beneficial for all parties involved, and the end result was that we were the only music store that could advertise in those outlets.

It worked too. We were easily the most successful music store in the area. We were informed on several occassions that other music outlets tried to advertise and were denied due to exclusivity.

I don't really see anything wrong with this. I'm all for competition in the marketplace, and I see this as part of the competition. Much like how a business tries to woo a customer in with great service and wonderful relationships, you try to do the same with advertising outlets. Both benefit your business in the long run.

This is no different than the bar I go to regularly. I'm there every week with friends, and we get a "regular customer discount" on our bills. Sometimes a night of drinks and food is discounted upwards of 40%. Not every customer gets it, but we built a relationship with the establishment to get that type of treatment.

Life is about relationships and so is business. This is an example of that.
Sodastream is an Israeli owned company, expect CBS to issue an apology, pay a fine, contribute a large sum of cash to AIPAC and the ADL, and promptly air a bunch of Holocaust programmes. If they don't, watch as Coca Cola gets widely exposed for developing Fanta for the Nazis.
So are there not some sort of antitrust laws being broken by this?  
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! D: I <3 SodaStream. 
Ban? Sounds like a rejection to me. I guess "ban" makes better linkbait.
CBS can suck it. No love for CBS!
Looking afraid of a competitor is the wrong publicity to give to that competitor. I would never have watched the superbowl to hear about them, and I heard about them now. CBS with the guerrilla marketing.
And this kind of crap, kiddies, is why the Telecommunications "Reform" Act of 1996 needs to be repealed.  It's a stupid, stupid, stooopid idea to turn control of your media over to an oligarchy.
There is something [VERY wrong](http://www.palestinechronicle.com/old/view_article_details.php?id=17308) with SodaStream.
I am in favour of the ban, but for other reasons:  http://rabbibrant.com/2013/01/29/interfaith-coalition-launches-boycott-of-sodastream/
I felt bad for them thinking they were a small newcomer to the market with a clever idea until I did a little research and found out they've been around since 1903 and use proprietary valves on their CO2 canisters so they can charge 10-20x the going market rate to refill them, and that they sue companies that refill their canisters and tried to ban sales of them on ebay as well:

That's brilliant! I would go out and buy a sodastream RIGHT NOW if i could make it with pepsi products!!
Actually it'd make more sense to have their own, that way there's no revenue sharing. But that wouldn't be good from a consumer point of view of course.
[CBS is not compromised, how dare you question their integrity!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQYwFND7rHE) 
CBS is just the one caught with its hand in the cookie jar this month, they all do it
I never even heard of it. Can anyone say why I should give a shit?
Yes, and we have a right to read between the lines and call them on it.
But CBS has a responsibility to be editorially independent - including in advertising.  They have a responsibility to do what is best for the people as voters and as consumers.

Why?  Because they are granted the privilege of a broadcasting license.  

They hold a valuable position to be able to control what people see and hear in the media, and the ability to manipulate public opinion and markets.  They can do this because they are granted frequency in a very limited radio spectrum by the government (FCC) on behalf of the people.

Therefore, as a part of the FCC granting use of the spectrum CBS has a responsibility to "best serve the public interest".

Promoting free market competition and remaining editorially independent both best serve the public interest.  If another private company can better serve the public interest by promoting these things, then CBS should have its license revoked and that spectrum reallocated to another provider.

**TL;DR**, CBS is not just a private company that can do what they like, they have a responsibility to do what best serves the public interest because they are given a broadcast license to do so.  This Includes promoting free market competition and remaining editorially independent.
I agree 100%, and I think that there should be no legislative reaction to this action.  HOWEVER, I think that this article and similar information spreading is a good thing as well.
It doesn't really matter how good or bad Soda Stream is.

This is about CBS and their total lack of credibility as a media outlet.  They already destroyed the credibility of [CNET with the CES fiasco.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/ces-tells-cnet-youre-fired/)  They're trying to make a laughing-stock of themselves *again,* by bowing to the big interests.

edit: too sleepy to grammar.
I'll second that. 

Just about anything else is a better flavor additive than their syrups. 

But fizzy water? For that price and convenience? Fucking awesome. 

Mixed alcoholic beverages, mixed with juice, with other 'water enhancers'....just a great product. 
I suppose one could try and match the coke recipe, I would feel disgusted with myself for adding so much sugar though.
You can use tea concentrates to make your own flavoring. Go crazy. Add vitamin C and caffeine too if you like. 
The cola is alright if ingested within an hour. I tried the cherry cola and it tasted like cough syrup. My wife just enjoys carbonated water so we still get some use from it.
Apple spritzer! Yum. 
Actually, I like their root beer and diet cola quite well. Never buy the name brands anymore.
I was trying to save money and bought the diet energy mix to mix with sparkling water from the store.  I tried it first with plain water and it tasted like shitty whiskey flavored cough syrup.
its a machine that allows you to carbonate your own beverages at home and you can buy syrup that mimics popular sodas.
And that's why your country is basically limping around right now with a dying middle class. There is definitely manipulation going on where it applies to the 'free market.' 

Americans are dumb enough to root for the giant corporations, even as they get crushed by them. They're still waving the corporate flag as they take their last breaths. So brave and so stupid. 

If America had much of anything right, that would be reflected in its people. As it stands, you have 50 million people who have absolutely no health care with medical expenses the main cause of bankruptcy. You've got the **FIFTH** most unequal wealth distribution in the *entire* world, you've got the lowest number of middle class since the Great Depression and you are dumb enough to only elect those who protect the interests of corporations and the very wealthy and ignore the interests of the poor and dwindling middle class.

Yep, you got it right as a nation, alright. America: Fuck yeah. You're not experiencing a social or economic crisis or anything. 

Keep doing everything *exactly* the same. I mean, more of all this corporation worship by the sycophants of the class that can barely keep its head above water is *just* what America needs.

PRIVATE ~~COMPANIES~~ CORPORATIONS DESTROYING ANYONE WHO DARES TRY TO GET A PIECE OF THE AVAILABLE MARKET. That's what our forefathers fought and died for! Make no mistake.
Soda is hardly a healthy drink.  And this product has been around since 1903, it's not novel or innovative.
Because while it makes sense for the business in question- hence why they do it- it's not necessary a good thing for the market as a whole.  Remember, our economic system only works well if there is a high amount of equity to allow people to compete.  By allowing "exclusivity" like this, it is allowing pre-established businesses an edge based not on it's market efficiency, but rather the fact that it came first, which doesn't really mean much.  Equity in the marketplace is reduced, so in the end, the economy looses out.

Everyone having a fair shot of competing is necessary for economy and economic growth.  Allowing the markets to petrify themselves for their gain is bad.

EDIT: Apparently SodaStream is an old company, and does some messed up things themselves.  While what CBS did is still wrong, I don't really pity SodaStream anymore.


Not in a country designed to protect the wealthy and punish the poor. It's all part of the pretend free market everyone talks about. You can break into the 'market' but you're not 'free' to compete with giants who can crush you by throwing their money and weight around.
Alright, this needs to be seen by somebody that can tell me if this is true or not. Upvote. 
tl;dr: Their main production facility is on Israeli-claimed Palestinian land, they pay above standard wages, they employ people of many nationalities, Israeli environmental law doesn't apply in occupied territories, and they've received certifications from certifying organizations. 
Here's a [third party adapter](http://sodaco2.com/Home.html)
...Hm, but would Soda Stream let them?
Was that seriously part of the show?

Its a two minute commercial break within a tv show.  Showing off a product for a few seconds is good and all but when you start putting 2 minute commercials within a show that's just wrong.  Don't we get enough commercials during the show?  And they wonder why people love dvrs so much.   
I'm surprised any of the others actually reported this story. Maybe because all the small independent tech blogs and podcasters like TWiT network already broke the story they had no choice?
Do you ever drink fizzy water? If no, you won't ever give a shit. If yes, you might care. 

It's a home carbonation system. You get a CO2 tank and some bottles, fill the bottles with water, and then carb them yourself. You can then add whatever you want to the carbonated water. It's essentially club soda, but add a soda syrup and it's soda. 

The beauty is that after the initial outlay, it's extraordinarily inexpensive. On the order of $0.20 per liter. 

So like I said, if you don't ever drink fizzy water, you won't care. If you drink a lot of it, and aren't totally tied to pure coke/pepsi, you might care a great deal. Personally, we use it as club soda, and mix it with juice and other things. Not as a replacement for coke. But that has driven our coke drinking down, as we now have more interesting (and healthy) stuff to drink. 
So would you feel the same way if a local CBS station rejected Applebees from advertising on their television network because they already have a financially beneficial relationship in place with a local "Mom and Pop" restaurant ... and they don't want to hurt that small company, or their relationship with them?
[deleted]
Gin. Gin and a soda stream together would make a fantastic RomCom. 
Tastes good and cures scurvy!
When I bought it I got the sampler pack I couldn't stomach any of them. But if you have a juicer you can make some amazingly healthy fizzy drinks!
That's a big rant for a story about CBS not trying to lose two of their biggest sponsors over a small company like Sodastream.
You think Americans don't know that our culture and political process is fucked up? You need to surf Reddit more.
We'd better amend the constitution to state that every company is entitled to have their marketing materials distributed without interruption.

> that's why... dying middle class

What are you, Glenn Beck with this over the moon nonsense?
Yeah.. This is not what is ruining America. 
Not me... 
Wonder what your country would have to do for the rest of the world to know stats like that about it.
[deleted]
You can carbonate fruit juice as opposed to "soda". The generic product has been around since forever but an easy, affordable product with enough capital to be mass marketed against bottled sodas apparently has not been around that long.
Lets look at it from CBS's perspective.

Coca Cola and Pepsi contribute (I assume) millions upon millions of dollars in revenue to CBS for advertising. Why would CBS risk damaging a relationship with a company that makes up a huge percentage of their advertising revenue in order to work with a company that can't match their financial compensation?

I've never seen a Sodastream commercial on TV before, but I see Coke and Pepsi advertisements everyday. To possibly piss off Coke and Pepsi to the point where they spend less and/or bring their advertising dollars elsewhere would be bad business on CBS's part.

I understand your argument for "a fair shot at competing", but unfortunately it's not a logical argument to make. It doesn't make sense from a financial perspective on CBS's part to allow Sodastream to advertise. This is strictly a business decision.

I'll pose a question to you that I posed to someone else about this :

Say a local newspaper had a wonderful business relationship with a local Mom and Pop restaurant. That restaurant makes up for a solid portion of the advertising budget of the newspaper.

Lets say an Applebees moved into town and the newspaper didn't allow Applebees to advertise because they know the advertisement would not only damage the relationship they have with the Mom and Pop, but it would also negatively effect that restaurant's financial situation. They want to stand by their loyal customer, because that customer continuously contributes advertising dollars to them.

Would you feel the same? Would you bash that newspaper for standing by their long time customer instead of letting a new competitor to come in or would you preach "fair marketplace" and say they should allow Applebees to advertise?

I personally feel, if this were flip flopped, and CBS catered to a small company over a big one, the anger and ire about this would not be present. I actually feel like CBS would be applauded for their stance by the Reddit community.
Because you think someone has faked the video?  The news of this unsettling fact is all across the Internet.
and, they engage in war crimes.
My guess is yes, Pepsi and Coke should be able to throw enough money at Soda Stream to make it worth while. If SS wants to much, Pepsi or Coke find/create a similar product. 
yeah there's some really blatant product placement/advertising in that show.

here's another from that show.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfHuZ5qrYX4
Hardly ever. I mostly drink flat water, chocolate milk and milk tea (not all at the same time).

But regardless, why should I give a shit if one product is not being advertised on one network? Do companies have a right to advertise their products to every person in the nation?
"promoting free market competition".

Please read the comment.
Yeah, why should I give a fuck whether or not I'm getting all the ads from every company on Earth? 


> editorially independent -  in advertising. 

I've never even heard of that. Is this just your personal declaration, demanding that the people must be informed about any business that wants to reach us? WTF?
Whiskey isn't half-bad either. 
It brought gramps back to life! Sure shootin'!
cool suggestion. I wil have to try and experiment a bit.
Lose what? Like Coke and Pepsi would stop advertising on CBS. They are basically just advertising companies, financing the ads by selling overpriced sugar water.

Coke and Pepsi’s biggest competition is with each other, but you don’t see either threatening to pull advertising because the other’s ads are carried, too. They are acting like a cartel protecting their shared market from disruption. This is bullshit and CBS playing ball is bullshit, too.
Hate?
You completely misunderstood my post.  I admitted that it makes sense for CBS.  What I was arguing is that it's a bad thing for society as a whole.  The responsible thing *would* be for CBS to treat **all** customers equally since advertising it vital to the marketplace, and for Pepsi and Coke-a-cola to accept that.  But, that's not in their best interest.
Well, apparently SS used to have sunkist.  They've just never been too popular.
>"promoting free market competition".

>Please read the comment.

Free market allows CBS to choose who they do business with, because they are free to do business with whomever they choose. The fact that they own frequency spectrum does not limit those freedoms.
[deleted]
No I'm saying the opposite of that 
I use DaVinci or Torani syrups, as well as those Mio things. I only buy their diet cola syrup, for the most part. Plus, you can buy adapters so you are no longer locked into their CO2 tanks, which are a rip off. To be sure... haven't bought diet Pepsi.... I do love my Sodastream...
>Coke and Pepsi’s biggest competition is with each other, but you don’t see either threatening to pull advertising because the other’s ads are carried, too.  
  
Of course Coke isn't threatening to pull out because of Pepsi, Pepsi has power, big bucks, and would just increase market share if Coke left the airwaves.  Sodastream isn't worth much to CBS and rejecting their Super Bowl ad dollars is nothing compared to the loss in advertising dollars from Coke and Pepsi.  
  
I doubt Coke and Pepsi would even care about Sodastream if they hadn't used their trucks and product in the commercial.
Maybe next election cycle they refuse to air Democratic candidates' ads.  FREEDOM OR SOVNGARD!
Just because they *can*, doesn't mean they *should*.

As a broadcaster using limited spectrum granted to them by the government, they have greater responsibility and accountability to the public.

If they choose to ignore that responsibility, ultimately the FCC could intervene or simply not renew their license.

Just because it isn't illegal, doesn't mean it is ethical.
I know, the "yeah" was in agreement with you. The questions were directed at free_to_try (whom I quoted).
Advertising for companies and candidates is different. I am referring to companies doing business with other companies.
[deleted]
Oh my bad, for some reason I thought you were being sarcastic. 
Licensing comes with ethical responsibilities.

The FCC licenses commercial companies to use broadcast spectrum "based on what best serves the public interest".  Because the broadcast spectrum for TV is a limited public resource.

Therefore in order to hold onto their licenses, broadcasters have a responsibility to serve the public interest.  This includes acting as the fourth estate (maintaining editorial independence in news, current affairs and other programming), as well as editorial independence in advertising to promote competition in the free market.

It is an ethical responsibility, although there is no specific legislation saying they cannot refuse a commercial.

But if they continue to show a repeated pattern of bias (which is always against the public interest whether politically or commercially), then the FCC can simply decide that another company might better serve the public interest with the use of that spectrum and simply license it so someone else.

So while it is unlikely to happen, they don't need to break a law in order to lose their license or for the FCC to intervene with warnings etc.  They just need to be seen to not serving the public interest.
free_to_try is right to a point.

The FCC licencing requires a lot of very specific rules and content be broadcast by anyone using the public air waves.

For example, any over-the-air station is required to broadcast a few hours of "educational children's programming" a day.  The rules however do not specify what is educational or what time of day this broadcast happens, so most stations run ULTRA shitty (ie. cheap) cartoons in the dead of night around 1am-4am abouts.  No child ever sees them and it is a total waste of time and resources, but them's the rules.

TV stations have to keep insanely detailed logs of commercials, and have to justify why one commercial is over played compared to another.  This is particularly important in regard to political adds.  Promotional adds for the TV station itself are included in this.  "TONIGHT AT 10....."


Source:  I produced topical promotional adds for a TV station for 2 years.
Can they make it drinkable?
I need to stop drinking this shit. Hate most diet drinks but I love Coke Zero for whatever reason 
They already tried this, they made Sugar Free Coke almost identical to their other attempts at using Asparteme instead of sugar, if you put it beside Diet Coke you wouldn't be able to tell the difference in taste. It was basically just a new label for Diet Coke that looked similar to the regular coke label.
If only the changes would be positive enough to convince the skeptics to get a bottle. 
For some people being offended is a full-time occupation.
I doubt most people would be offended by this. I'd say it's just a vocal minority doing all this.
The pussification of America. 
If you are genuinely offended by this ad than you must be offended 24/7 about every ad ever made
give me a fucking break. god i truly hate people. 
Sick and tired of how fucking sensitive everyone is nowadays. Everyone's a damned crybaby.
im starting a campaign to only allow offensive ads 
So they are upset the actors are Caucasian? 
damn PC has reached mexico, I'm losing hope
I like the old Coca Cola Christmas commercials with the polar bear.

I don't know what ad they saw, but I don't see any racism and colonialism. I see small groups looking for outrage and publicity. Coca Cola will surivive.
[deleted]
It's still 2015, people will be offended up until new years. 
It's just advertising 101 to have models as the focus of your ad, but yeah it's annoying  to see the focus on an attractive white savior bringing benefits to the benighted natives.

Paul mooney had a hilarous bit about it: In hollywood its always a white guy who saves everyone.  Dances with wolves: kevin costner saves the indians. 
 Last of the Mohicans was a white guy: daniel day lewis.  The Last Samurai is tom cruise.  I'm waiting for a movie called "The Last N****r on Earth", starting Tom Hanks!
The amount of cognitive dissonance here makes me want to shit myself to death.
I don't have a clue about the ethnic makeup of Mexico so if there are any Mexican posters here can you tell me if the group of kids in the ad look really out of place for Mexico? 
ITT: white ppl saying the minorities shouldn't feel offended. As if their opinions matter in this case. (Bring on the down votes)
Sadly, it's actually profitable to be the victim (or at least claim to be one) in the US these days. 
I feel this is what a lot of political 'science' involves. 
Like Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, some people know they get paid (ahem, receive donations) only when they're making a huge deal and 'fighting' something. No idea who gives donations, though.
Your comment both offends and scares me. I demand that you pull your comment and publicly apologize /s
This has more to do with Americans being a highly litigious society, ready to take money from one anothers wallets for the slightest offence. Corporations like this just happen to have the biggest wallets around. Welcome to America, where the new Dream is to sue until you're rich.

>"reproduced and reinforced stereotypes of indigenous people as culturally and racially subordinate.

Its like a Chinese company trying to sell their product and claim that unites dirty extremist Muslim terrorists w white middle class. Are they really that fucking stupid?
Theres money in it, though.

America rewards this kind of thinking through lawsuits.
The irony is, they have you being sensative to their sensativity. I think you caught PC dude. Better see a doctor and get checked out
Thats because you're a climate change denying trans-bear phobic oppressor.

...I hope the second part of that comment isn't real, these Tumblrinas are really that insane.

The article has the link to the video.
I didn't see anyone say that. Just people saying they aren't offended, or that most wouldn't be.

 It's almost like you're generalizing a group based on your own politics and preconceived notions. 

It's the damnest thing.
You're thinking of social science. Political science is a serious discipline (for grown ups) that deals with real issues, not cultural appropriation and microaggressions.
Morons give donations to things like this.
Haha in the immortal words of Tim Alan *Never give up, Never Surender* Hail Hitler 
But what stereotypes? All I see is people uniting villagers, should the Red Cross not have ads of people helping out the poor? Are we living in a world where that is too un PC? What about the Peace Corps 
Fuck. FUCK. You're right. 
It's based off of the context of the ad. And based on your logic of how I'm generalizing a group, it would mean the people who complained about doesn't have any basis of their own opinion just because there are Mexicans who look European (Caucasian) are in a role that looks eerily similar to how the British colonized American with Native Indians already there.

At the very least, to anyone who isn't white, the optics looks bad, especially to any who knows anything on the colonial period of the 14-17th century (take your pick on a country NOT in Europe)

But fuck history
[Hey hosers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNRlcjz3acU)
I wonder if this is going to turn out like the mouse in the Monster energy can case, where it turned out the guy left the can in his car open for 3 days, then decided to take a sip lol.
Has anyone ever seen the science fair experiment where they leave a tooth in coke for a weekend? There is no way that mouse would even be recognizable. 

I like how Coke is beating around the bush saying that the mouse would be further decomposed instead of straight up saying that their product is so acidic that the mouse wouldn't even exist anymore. 
Well, Duff had Hitler's head in a beer bottle, so anything is possible.
I was 4 minutes late
Probably. The processing make this incredibly unlikely. Has any claim of a foreign object in a soda ever turned out to be true?
Straight to the tooth of the matter! 

I think that's a myth. 

https://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/science-experiment-conclusion-coke-the-real-thing/
Interesting. Though I still think the mouse would be a lot worse off than the picture indicates. 
Sugar is used in canning (fruit, particularly) to keep down bacteria growth.  The mixture is too rich, and consequently bacteria (which cause decomposition) are minimal, which makes decomp take vastly longer.

Back in the day, the British Navy would preserve bodies in rum, which basically sugar, water, and alcohol, so it was quite effective.

I know you're joking but I'm pretty sure pepsi and coke are both good where they are and comfortable with the healthy rivalry and have been for some time. If you could even call it a rivalry (from their perspectives.)

http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/07/06/pepsi-alerted-coca-cola-to-stolen-coke-secrets-offer.html
If Pepsi tasted like Coke, people would just buy Coke instead. Not worth the legal trouble.
Is it really news? From a basic point of view, if you don't change anything but switch from regular coke to diet, you will lower your caloric intake, which is going to the right direction in terms of weight loss.
I'm doing a study to see if this Jack Daniels makes diet coke taste better.

Results inconclusive, will attempt again.
If you suck down 500 calories a day in coke and switch to diet coke without making any other changes, no shit you're going to lose weight.  
Maybe they can find the next Jared, mainlining diet coke and whatever other shitty products.

Pancreatic cancer here we come. 

You know what is more better for you then diet drinks? Water. 
They do not... they do promote hormonal changes and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by promoting insulin resistance. Source - Science.
Does anyone else remember when Big Oil was on the forefront of researching green house gas effects and then suddenly started strongly opposing climate change legislation?

The coming storm of people with diabetes is going to be just as revealing, I suspect. We live in a time now, in the west, where we have succeeded in feeding the very poor the very worst food and it in turn creates a vastly ill population that will always be in need of medical treatment.
As we move into fascism, this is what future university research will look like. 
The sucralose in the diet coke will lead to insulin spikes though, lowering your insulin sensitivity. That eventually leads to fat gain.

edit: [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26095119)
That would be the case if caloric content was the only variable.  Some sugar replacements have been known to influence other factors; appetite for example.  So, while your statement about net calorie intake and expenditure is appropriate, if you consider the result across a large population you may still see a net increase in the calories consumed.

Anecdotally, I've personally used sugar replacements with some success, but that isn't directly applicable to large populations.  I'm far from an expert in the area, but my wife is in public health research and we've spoken on the topic numerous times.
No, they don't.
It's a red flag, but look at the data and methodology.

You are correct, univesity should not take money from corporation for these things. However, where is the separation line? There are a lot of ways to take money, and not bias the research.
1: notice the lack of numbers in that abstract?

2: Sucralose isn't in *Diet Coke* it is in *Coke Zero*

3: To "have a metabolic affect" just means it could be measured, it doesnt make it dietarily significant
yep.   best to just quite soda in general. 
Sucralose isn't even in Coke Zero. It was in Coke with Splenda, which proved unpopular. I don't even know if it's still made.

But Coke Zero is aspartame and acesulfame potassium.

Source: I drink a lot of Coke Zero. It doesn't make me crave sugar, but it does make me crave more Coke Zero.
I'll read it later when I sign into the proxy.  It's an abstract to a literature review, so the absence of numbers is not necessarily an absence of evidence.  I cited it because it was the first thing that comes up on PubMed.  It's my impression that this effect was found with all artificial sweeteners.
Why? NO harm has been shown from drinking diet coke.

At this point you're just fear mongering.

Oh my bad, was going off of memory on the Coke zero. It only has I think >60 mg caffeine so I don't bother, diet 20oz has as much caffeine as a mountain dew or redbull
You need to realize that not all studies in pubmed have good quality and methodology. Linking to the first hit blinde will, and has, made you look like a fool.

Read and understand studies before linking. Understand statistical relevance and what makes good methodology, understand blinding, understand bayesian vs P value.

If you don't have time because you are at work, then focus on work and not grabbing random studies. 


You should probably read something before you cite it. Smh
Hey, it happens!

I always find it funny though that there's a lot of claims that diet soda makes you crave sugar... if anything, I've become anti-sugar. I find I do not want sweet things at all, because sugar now tastes "weird" to me. Non-diet soft drinks are definitely off the list, but candy and cakes and other sweets have fallen considerably since I got used to "diet" soda. I rarely touch any of it, the sweetness is overwhelming and it all just tastes funny.

Mostly, I just want my cherry coke zero... lol.

Hope you're alright! Chattanooga is a nice town.
From a perspective of statistics Chatanooga is one of the most dangerous cities in Tennessee.
Yep, this is more than I expected today.
Thanks. Hard to keep up with it all.
But not this type of stuff. It's mostly gang on gang. 
Per capita. Yes. 
There's also rumor of a possible third shooting in nearby Cleveland at the mall there.
We have a serious gang on gang problem. It seems like a shooting or more per day. I remember several years back, 11 people were shot on Christmas eve. Insane. 
Just watched on reporter on periscope at that scene, says it may have started there.
Its really bad but rarely is an innocent person shot. 
Well it is lactose free. Lactose-reduced milk already costs about double what regular milk runs. Increasing the protein and reducing the sugar is a nice bonus too.

Will wait to see it to judge.
[deleted]
Well, of course it's more expensive.  It has twice your daily recommended dose of Vitamin R.
"premiumisation of milk" - wanker?
So since this has no Lactose in it, would a lactose intolerant person be able to drink this without problems?

So, real milk though.  Not that nasty almond milk, or shit like that.
Sorry, but in a couple of those ads it looks like the pin up girls are peeing milk.
I'm pretty satisfied with my non-premiumised milk, thanks Coca-Cola...but no thanks. 
No surprise. Look how much money the bottled water people make.
I hear goats milk does all that...why not just buy some goats?
so your marketing strategy is to have the execs boast about it "raining money"? yeah. that will go far.

Normally, a "dairy farm" means cows. As rats are not considered "dairy"
Yah just like lactaid basically. 
Coke owns Dasani Water.
i read goatse milk

thanks and you're welcome.
You heard wrong.

Goat milk in nutritionally nearly identical to Cow milk.
It's on Yahoo Finance, so it's a marketing strategy aimed at the consumer of Coca-Cola stock, not the consumer of this "new" product.
I dont see that in the article. Could you perhaps enlighten me with some references?
"You promised me dog or better!"

At least it'll have plenty of vitamin R.

A dairy is a business enterprise established for the harvesting of animal milk – mostly from cows or goats, but also from buffaloes, sheep, horses or camels – for human consumption.  

Think again.
And it has lactose issues like cow milk?
the Gruber effect. the assumption that people who will be buying the product are not the same people that read the business and financial news. Pretty fucking arrogant.
S/he obviously didn't read the article, especially given that the product has 50% less sugar than Milk and he's QQing about doubling the chance of diabetes.

Yes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance#Management
That's not entirely true, many people with lactose intolerance enjoy drinking goat's milk with no issue, but can't drink cow milk.  It's not a direct relationship where 10% less lactose = 10% less chance of triggering lactose intolerance; my family is lactose intolerant yet drinks goat milk like it's water, with no issue.  With all dietary ailments there's always the YMMV disclaimer, but many lactose intolerant people do switch to goat's milk with great success.  The next question is then, if they like the taste :P  There are also overall less allergens in goat's milk, if you know something in cow milk is giving you issue but it's not necessarily the lactose (ex. look up "alpha s1 casein").
Maybe, but its probably not the cornerstone of their marketing strategy to consumers. Those flashy graphic design inserts in the article probably will be. I agree with you that the exec using that figure of speech is pretty low brow and I'm definitely not lapping up KO shares.
Do you have more confidence in products that execs say will fail? 
Wow thanks...
One could say that they were... *foiled* again.
Looks like the banks just crossed a line with the soda companies. Now they fucked up. These companies have money. 
The Romans figured out that stockpiling goods to manipulate prices should be illegal in 50 BC. Lex Julia de Annona. They included the death penalty for violations.
GS, JPM, Global Terrorists, turnip. One of these things is not like the others.
Scientists and technology companys for decades have wanted to end the diamond monopoly by De Beers... so good luck with that.
That is how it plays when the economy is not only allowed, but encouraged to monopolize.  

Monopolization is the ultimate end of unregulated capitalism.
The Us government has put so much money into the pockets of the financial institutions, they are now able to speculate in everyday commodities like aluminium or agricultural products, raising prizes and creating artificial shortages.  

Profits, profits, profits is the name of the game. Do you want to know a dirty little secret? ***YOU*** ladies and gentlemen are paying for this extravaganza!  

The big financial institutions have paralysed all government agencies whose task it is to keep them in check. They owe most members of the Senate, Congress and of cause the President. Its has all been done with tax payer money. QE1, QE2 QE3 and the 2008 bailout has poured approximately 20 trillion dollars at zero interest rate into their pockets and they intend to control every facet of life to create more profits for them self.

Yeah and for the next ~1500 odd years lending money with interest was considered about as noble as prostitution.
> The Romans figured out that stockpiling goods to manipulate prices should be illegal in 50 BC

Let's follow the wonderful policies of an empire that collapsed thousands of years ago. The free market does that with every fucking commodity known to man without a problem, and butthurt redditors are just finding out. If any of you idiots invested in the market, you would know how stupid the idea of cornering the market actually is.
Global terrorists?
De Beers don't have a monopoly on synthetic diamonds, do they?
Prizes huh?  Where do I collect?
Yet we all know it and can't do shit about it.  They flaunt it in our faces and still.  They're power is already beyond what we can stop.
China and Korea should pull a doozie on them. Stop buying any of it and watch the market freefall, or simply call in America's debts.
> "If banks own storage, distribution, transmission or generating assets, they have the ability to manipulate prices for the benefit of their own balance sheet, to the disadvantage of the public interest, which is why they were prohibited from such activities after the Great Depression to the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley in 1999,"

At least prostitutes didn't get a bail out nor big bonuses for bankrupting the nation.
> of cause

I assumed that Hooked on Phonics (tm) plus a Texas accent had failed him again. ;) 
A better way to say it:

At least prostitutes are contributing something, not just figuring out new ways to get something for nothing: the bankers parasite mantra.
I just think of it this way: Prostitutes *literally* fuck you while banks figuratively fuck you, so at least you're getting something from the prostitute.
*Or else...* 

This is how sponsors take a walk...
Why do we assume whoever takes over for Darth Blatter won't just keep the status quo? 
Good for them, about time the sponsors got involved
Holy shit is Sepp still there?! Assumed he left ages ago.
Sponsors may frankly be the *only* way any justice will be done.  It's too easy to slow or halt governmental investigations if those under the microscope have enough money, but you put a kink in the cash hose and Blatter going to find himself disposed by his own employees.
Yep, that's what John Oliver called for months ago. He begged the sponsors to put pressure on FIFA. Love that man!
Me too actually 
This is one of the primary reasons why many countries had quietly agrred to allow the US Justice Dept to take the lead in going after FIFA in the first place because corruption within the sport and football orgs were too tightly connected with many govt's. 

I'd bet money Sepp won't be visiting the US (least not voluntarily) for a very long time.

You can also kill yourself by drinking too much water.
actually no soda should be able to do this to you

she had to have other issues as well
I'm actually embrassed that it happened to someone here in New Zealand :( I've been sort of following it on the news here, given how found I am of soda in general, and I've found the whole thing very WTFish... Personally I start feeling very physically ill long before reaching that level drunk.
My brother drinks nothing but Mt. Dew.  It's fucking disgusting.  I'd rather have the crab juice.
Will you please just order a large? 
She had to be mega fat.  That's an insane amount of sugar to take in every day.

OK...they sell Coke exclusively in units of liters or ounces in the U.S.  

This is our frame of reference to soda pop.  

So why the fuck is the headline using gallons?  

/rantoff
Try to half that intake with water so you don't end up flopping over.  Also, it should give you a better "rush" if you are drinking less of it, so drinking some water after a pepper may help.
Too late!

No, a human was lost, a life, any dead thing is a valuable thing since it once lived.
It didn't happen in America. 
2.2 gallons a day would do it for a lot of people I think, too. She might not have been able to drink so much if not for the sodium in the Coke.
But there's a difference between drowning and destroying your body with soda
Addiction would be the largest issues in this.

Also, soda can do this too you. Check the amounts of sugar it has, its enough to kill you in large quantities.

Is that episode un-banned yet?
And that would explain why she could probably stomach it for so long / could drink so much.

Her body, if more physically fit may have lived if she drank the same amount, but you shouldn't drink that much of anything.
Well, I don't need it for a 'rush', I need it to remain awake while working.  I generally switch to crystal lite and similar substances after I return home, so as to allow the caffeine to wear off before bedtime.
Why is it the dumbest people have the most children??

According to the wiki:

>It has since come back into syndication in some areas; however, parts of the episode are often edited out.[6] One previously such edited item is a scene of two men arguing across Tower 1 and Tower 2, where a man from Tower 2 claims, "They stick all the jerks in Tower One!" Co-executive producer Bill Oakley commented in retrospect that the line was "regrettable".

I haven't seen it in my area.
I have seen it in sindication, a few times since 9/11.

Your kidneys would beg to differ, I'm sure.
Well, you have spiked my intrest. From all that i've read/heard there is hardly nothing great about large amounts of consumption of sugar. Care to share something on it? I thought large amounts of sugar effected numerous organs and the brain....

EDIT: Oh, and btw it's /u/kaelter :P
Are you confusing consumed sugar with blood glucose levels?
I screwed up wording, I meant coffee. Generic coffee is rather cheap and is made to keep you up better. Maybe go for regular Doctor Pepper so you get the sugar as well.  It is incredibly expensive to buy Soda in most circumstances if you drink as much as you said.
I know, I just said I fucked up, I meant coffee in general, and starbucks sells coffee.  Maybe re-read my edit.
Possibly, been a long day/night.
Eh, it generally costs between $7.50 and $10 per week, not counting sodas at meals, which are more variable.  Given that a single meal can cost between $2 and $12 or more, that's not too bad.
Sponsors are really the only groups outside FIFA with any power to create change 
Now maybe something will happen
Or they could, you know, *not* sponsor .. That'd force change right there.
Who the fuck cares about some soccer organization
Hopefully things will go better with Coke.
Sponsors are the only groups FIFA cares about, inside or outside of the organization, and so are the only group *anywhere* with any power to create change.

If sponsors flee, FIFA dies.  FIFA will respond to the death threat a hell of a lot better than they will to anything else.
They already invested a lot of money into the whole thing. If they suddenly dropped the sponsorship they probably wouldn't get their money back.

Trying to reform FIFA to be less obviously corrupt could get them some good PR points and save some of that investment.
At the moment I would hazard a guess that any money you spend being associated with FIFA is one of those investments that won't pay off. Sometimes it's better to cut your losses. 
The moment you see Coca Cola on your screen to promote a world cup you've seen the ad and coca cola has maintained it's presence in your head.
That doesn't translate to a sale. In fact in this instance it'll remind me what assholes they are for supporting FIFA. 
That's not why advertisements exist. it has been shown that people don't change their buying habits when non of the competing products does advertisement. The problem is when just one of the companies advertises and the other doesn't. That's how it influences people. So basically companies want the cheapest way to show you their product name and big ads linked to big events is pretty much the cheapest way to promote a product.
> That doesn't translate to a sale.

Indirectly it does. Name 5 cola manufacturers that sell their product in the US.
Yeah, the billions of football fans around the planet will react similarly.
The missing assumption is the link is positive. Coke are linking their product to sports. What if the linkage is to corruption instead ? 
Only know 3, coke Pepsi and rc.
Yeah, I predict total collapse this week.
90% production requires sugar, holy hell, guess I shouldn't be surprised, glad I have cut down to enjoying one or two tasty sodas per week, otherwise h2o and coffee with just a few packets  
>Yeah, I predict total collapse this week.

Yep. Maybe next time, the US shouldn't try to topple democraticly elected governments.
What did the US have to do with Maduro and Chavez running the country into the ground?
Those big mean Americans always with their shit together and what not.... Boo hoo
You're not wrong, but that has nothing to do with Venezuela. They did this shit all on their own.
>What did the US have to do with Maduro and Chavez running the country into the ground?

Well, the US single-handedly drstabalized central and south america in the 50's and supported coups of several democratically ekected governments so US corporations could profit more.
Yeah, well its 2016. What does what happened in the 50's have to do with Hugo and Chavez? I'm looking for specifics.
Good luck on getting specifics. He is just regurgitating talking points from /r/worldnews

This one is pretty amazing too

Gawker: Honorable Journalism and Twitter Gags
This is why we can’t have nice things. 

It is just a fact that if you let people on the internet participate in things like this campaign then some people will go out of their way to muck it up.

Haha, Hitler must be the most famous person who ever lived right? 
Even so long after his death just being mentioned with him makes people freak out.
> Building a bot that attempts to spread hate through #MakeItHappy is a perfect example of the pervasive online negativity Coca-Cola wanted to address with this campaign.

They kind of have a point here... sure, Gawker's intention wasn't necessarily to "spread hate" (maybe it was?) but it's basically the same at that point anyway.
Tricked?

Not really.

The whole point of the campaign was to take negative things people wrote, and make them into a happy shape.


Given that, I don't really understand what the point of the Gawker bot was, unless Gawker is suggesting that quoting Hitler is positive.
Proving once again that "positivity" and stupidity are different sides of the same coin. 
I don't understand the shitty little twats that think this is 'hilarious'. 
Heh, folks hate Gawker for the exact same reason they love 4chan. Let's all pretend we weren't gushing like grannies over the Dub the Dew results.
exactly. They're too busy destroying video game culture with fraudulent articles about video game sexism, right?
Outrage-farming is a lucrative business.
The people that mucked it up are now crying outrage that it happened in the first place. Gawker did it deliberately, and now Gawker is decrying coke for having it happen. 
Gushing Granny had me in tears
That's Kotaku your thinking about.
Kotaku is owned by Gawker.
right, right. How's the fight against them going lately? I haven't heard much news, have we saved any video games at all?
Kotaku is owned by Kinja. Under Kinja there is Gawker, Kotaku, Deadspin, jalopnik, jezebel and many more.
That's a damn good question. I can't think of anything positive coming from this.
.......I didn't think so. Let's keep harassing people with CP and swat threats, though, just to be sure. That's a good plan. 
Now the real war begins.

Rock n roll, cola wars, I cant take it anymore!
I hope that this factory thrives. 

The Pepsi factory was 'off limits' to attacks by Hamas because Arafat was an investor. Not sure if the Coke factory will be treated the same.

Hamas has a history of doing things to make Gazans more miserable. Example: "Crazy Water"; a very popular water park http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_the_Gaza_Strip#Water_park
Share a Coke with Abdullah.
That's only in America we don't know to enjoy, instead we over indulge. I doubt they'll have that problem. Also they aren't going to be using corn syrup as the sweetener (also american) they'll use real sugar like everyone else.
I always took that lyric as, "Rock and Roller Color Wars", referencing the Bloods vs Crips. 
Everything Hamas does has the intention of making Gaza is a shitty place. Like Boko Haram or ISIS they are pure evil, and they have never served the well-being of the common Palestinian.
The effects of high fructose corn syrup on the human body are the same as sucrose. 

Period. Full stop. End of story.

HFCS comes in different sweetness levels. A level lower than that of sugar is less sweet than sugar, a level that is higher is more sweet. 

If you get a batch that has the same sweetness as an arbitrary solution of sugar and you taste the HFCS and the solution of sugar, they will taste exactly the same.

Not only that, but there is no evidence that anyone is tasting anything better in "Mexicoke" other than the glass of the bottle and the psychological effects of seeking out, finding, and consuming a rare product.

http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/09/the-food-lab-drinks-edition-is-mexican-coke-better-than-regular-coke-coke-taste-test-coke-vs-mexican-coke.html

http://sciencejon.blogspot.com/2012/10/does-real-sugar-make-mexican-coke-taste.html

An actual chemical analysis of "real sugar" Coke found that the "real sugar" in Coke was actually a chemical very close in composition to HFCS and that may be due to either a chemical reaction after bottling or simple mislabeling.

>For Coca-Cola, the fructose-to-glucose ratio varied from 58:42 to 65:35 for the three United States samples. The Mexican Coca-Cola sample had a fructose-to- glucose ratio of 52:48. 

[Sugar Content of Popular Sweetened Beverages Based on Objective Laboratory Analysis: Focus on Fructose Content](http://goranlab.com/pdf/Ventura%20Obesity%202010-sugary%20beverages.pdf)

>[Much of the confusion about high-fructose corn syrup stems from a 2004 article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that suggested rising obesity rates were related to increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages.](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/in-worries-about-sweeteners-think-of-all-sugars/) The lead author, Dr. George A. Bray, said in an interview last week that the real issue highlighted in the report was overconsumption of all sugary beverages, but that the article has been distorted as an indictment of high-fructose corn syrup alone. Dr. Bray notes that the fructose absorbed from large quantities of regular sugar and from high-fructose corn syrup is equally harmful. “Sugar is sugar,” said Dr. Bray, professor of medicine at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.

The problem with sugar is too much of it-- not what kind it is-- unless you know more than Dr. Bray, of course.

But hipsters gonna hip...

its "rock and dont monetize whores"
You're not wrong, but research (yeah, I'm too lazy to google) that I've recently read from some pretty decent primary sources seems to be differing a little.  I won't get into that though.

I will say that the problem with HFCS is that it's overrused everywhere.  It's overrused everywhere because it's more or less free.  It's more or less free because the government subsidizes corn production to absurd levels.

HFCS is in shit it has absolutely no place being in, and that's the big problem.  It being in your Coke?  Who cares.  Functionally equivalent to sucrose.  It being in nearly every processed food you eat?  Yeah.  That's a problem.

It would be interesting to see if cane sugar would have slowly entered every single product on the market like HCFS did, if there were no farm subsidies or protectionist laws in place.
>It being in nearly every processed food you eat?  Yeah.  That's a problem.

That's the problem! Why the hell are they putting sugar in ketchup?!? You have to pay a premium for ketchup with fewer things in it. 

Maybe that's due to subsidies making HFCS super cheap (cheaper than tomatoes?) and the move towards sweetening everything?

It's ridiculous but whether or not the sugar is cane sugar or HFCS it's bad.

Wait, but I'm looking at one *right now*.
This is a great ad strategy, papers will write about this all over the world - for free. lol
This is just another pr stunt. But a very good 1 at that. Coca cola knows how to get pr without actually destroying their reputation. I wish more companies were like that. They existed this long because their marketing departments actually knows what they are doing and when to listen to people.
Oh, it's in the Philippines. I was really confused, because a Coca-Cola commercial literally just came on my television. 
So they made an advertising announcement to announce that they will no longer be spending money on advertising. While every one of thier workers there have Coca Cola t-shirts and brand names all over them.

Yup. No more advertizing.  it is the oldest trick in the book to announce they are no longer advertising to do good so they get free advertising.
If the entire Coca-Cola advertising budget, not just the Philippines, was going I'd be a little more excited. 
Done likely for selfish PR reasons, but leads to beneficial humanitarian ends.

...Why does the world have to be so complicated?
And yet all I see is articles about how Coca Cola is doing this. It is absolutely advertising and these articles didn't come out of thin air and are prompted by Coca Cola. At this point in their brand, it's not just about awareness, or convincing you to buy coke over Pepsi, but attempting to intertwine their brand with your society and culture. That's the only way these huge sugar water companies can catalyze growth. 


Now if only they can do something about those South American Union leaders that coke hired assassins for. What's the PR for that? 
i AM looking at one just now.... 
Why do they advertise at all? Who is not aware of this product?
Lol what a Jew company. "We won't be advertising, because we're publicly announcing that are spending all that money on charity!! We're a good corporation!! Look at us, we're helping!!!!"  
I don't see ads - haven't for quite while
I guess a while isn't as long as I thought it was.  Coca Cola polar bear ad during the Texas A&M vs Missouri game.  Who else has spotted ads?
And here I thought it was because I'd never go there. Kidding. Good for coke. Least they could do probably.  I'd have been truly impressed if coke gave their entire global advertising budget.  I don't know about the rest of you.  But I've  made my choice. I like coke. In a glass.  With lots of ice.  No amount of advertising will ever make me choose a Pepsi over a coke.  None!  They are wasting all of that advertising money on people that would buy their taste preference regardless of that cute commercial they see on TV. 
Since it is the Yahoo Philippines page, I guess they didn't feel the need to get that specific, much like the US version doesn't mention that every story is specifically America-centric.
Yea, but the difference is that people who need help get help. I was initially cynical about this as well until I realized that this is a win-win situation: people that need help recovering from a disaster receive it and Coke might (keyword is might) not lose any noticeable amount of money because the goodwill they receive will offset the lack of advertising. To be honest it's kind of a shitty view to poo-poo a company that is actually helping people recover from a disaster because it may be calculated, even if it is realistic.
It's just kind of a Nash equilibrium at this point. If they stopped, people would only see Pepsi ads everywhere, and would slowly stop buying coke.
Permanent industrial cold war with Pepsi Co.
Brand recognition.

And to try and sway people away from their competitors.
Good for you. 
Nope, not a shill, not a shill at all...
/r/hailcorporate ?
Perhaps, but most restaurants I go to have Coca Cola fountain machines. The customer doesn't even get a choice in those cases. I think they're long past the 'too big to fail' point with market saturation. 
This is pretty much it. Their [lead in marketshare](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/rivalries/2013/08/pepsi_paradox_why_people_prefer_coke_even_though_pepsi_wins_in_taste_tests.single.html) is dominant but surprisingly small. Must be a lot more RC and Mate drinkers than I thought. 
Or just somebody who strongly prefers Coke to Pepsi, and you're fucking paranoid. 

I prefer Xbox to Playstation. Does that make me a shill for Microsoft? 
you're wrong.

that might be the single dumbest question i have ever seen on reddit.
You Microsoft shill you!  :)

No, I agree with you, more likely he likes coca cola vs some Machiavellian scheming going on.
What's the single dumbest question on reddit?
Where did the soda go?
For what purpose?
Sounds kind of like "Over the Moon", which I've been using for about a year. It's pretty great. ;)

I don't know if I'd trust Coca Cola with this though... 
Using sustainable farms with grass-fed milk, double the protein half the sugar etc. Sounds amazing if true. 
"Mr Douglas claimed that the milk “tastes better” than regular milk and is made on sustainable dairy farms with “high-care processes” and a “proprietary milk-filtering process”."

 ---- This is a bunch of bullshit. Although organic milk performs better in taste tests than non-organic (I think it tastes better as well), I really doubt they are doing anything different with processing and filtering the milk than Dean Foods or White Wave. Coke doesn't belong in the milk business: their warehouses are not set up for cold-storage and trucks are not refrigerated. Even pasteurized shelf-stable milk will go bad after hours in a hot truck (coca-cola will not). 

And this bullshit:

"Much of America’s milk is made in controversial mega-dairies where up to 30,000 cows are kept indoors all year round. But Mr Douglas said its milk will come from 92 family-owned farms, and Fairlife boasts that it will be “pursuing the highest standards of milk quality, agricultural sustainability and animal comfort”.

-all they are doing is copying Horizon Organic (who has made many types of dairy drinks, all organic from sustainable farms: with DHA, protein, etc). Fuck coke.

TLDR: Leave milk to actual dairy companies.
Drinking milk from a 2-liter feels wrong.
Am I the only one who has a problem with the marketing campaign? It's all about objectifying women, 'looking good' rather than being healthy. 
The types of fat in dairy products can be greatly affected by what the cows are feed. Grass feed versus corn feed is a big deal. I wonder if they are going to do this right or just try and fake it?
I just don't feel like the racy ads were necessary in 2014.

Regardless, I am looking forward to trying this new milk product.
First ingredient's corn syrup
This guy^
To make money. It's like bottled water but with milk.
To sell to schools. The school lunch market is /huge/ they will make billions...
I guarantee you it is not.

And there are Families that run those giant mega dairy's, I know a few. So just because it is "family owned" doesn't mean it isn't a big corporate operation.

Did you catch Jon Stewart talking about the New Jersey pigs not being able to turn around?
you really think they wouldn't refrigerate their trucks or their warehouses?
I'm a little late to this conversation, but I wrote a piece about this last week.  Thought some of you might like to read it.  Would love some feedback, too.  Thanks.  http://www.libertybriefing.com/articles/better-than-raw-milk/335
Of course they will fake it.

source: Dasani
Yeah, those claims were totally setting off my BS detector, although I'm somewhat curious in what exact way they're BS.
I literally worked at a coke warehouse and they do not refrigerate anything. It's a bad business move to introduce a product that requires you to change your infrastructure for little profit margins. Stick with the cash cows.
Regardless of who owns it, it's not okay to burn things down and sue terrorism like this to get your way or send a message. 

Jesus christ, what world do you people live in that it's okay to take your frustration against the system out on local businesses? Corporate or not, they are the only thing providing the few jobs that remain in those neighborhoods.
I'm sure a company as large and as profitable as Coke knows what they are getting into when they launch a new product. I will guarantee they will refrigerate their product.
Um...  Did you respond to the wrong post?   Because I said absolutely none of those things.
The issue is they will need to invest time and money changing their supply chain to distribute dairy products and likely will yield very little profit from the investment. They have little market share and are just trying to copy what better equipped dairy companies are successful at. You can disagree with me all you want but it's a fact that coke doesn't have dairy market share and other companies already make and distribute protein drinks better than coke could ever accomplish.
Yah it seems to have posted to the wrong comment. My apologies. 
You honestly think they don't think they can make money on this? Coca-Cola is a money making machine and they have teams of people that obviously think this will be a profitable campaign for them.

I'm sure they have calculated all the logistics you have pointed out. It's not like they just do these things willy-nilly.
edit: fuck it, you have no intelligent information or relevant work experience. you'd be surprised with how many stupid decisions big companies make and how much money goes to waste. It's a dumbass plan: just like you.
lmao get back to me when you're head of a multi-billion dollar company you fukin' jamook. The crux of your argument was that Coke didn't have the capacity to refrigerate milk. lmao you are fuckin' dumb.


edit: nice edit bro. so fuckin' mad.
So he has a banana?
Why can't she just be real with them?  

"OK look.  Soda's a snack.  If you want to hound us about coke being bad for you, go hound lays and little debbie first, because even their small snacks have more calories than our 12oz cans."
I pour my son a double esspresso with 5 lumps of sugar to help him windup
Classic misdirection. 
I hate the concept that soda or coffee is needed to "pick people up". I used to think the exact same thing. I was a heavy soda and coffee drinker. Anything with caffeine was what I turned to. Recently I realized it's unnecessary.

On the advice of someone whose articles I read online regularly, I began being much more pro-active in regards to drinking water a few weeks ago. I used to probably only have one or two glasses a day, now I carry a bottle with me at damn near all times and I take in a lot more.

The change it's had on my life has been shockingly dramatic. I find myself having more energy throughout the day. I'm no longer lethargic at 4pm, I feel fine. I also feel "healthier" (if that makes any sense). I don't find myself feeling bloated or bogged down, as I used to feel when I turned to coffee. Now I feel rather spry throughout the day, and I can actually notice a change in my body when I have days where I don't drink as much.

The downside is that I piss one hell of a lot more ... :)

Seriously though, I was a HEAVY soda and coffee drinker, but this one minor change has had a major impact on my life over the last few weeks. The more I read up on the subject, the more I realize that my body had been severely dehydrated; this caused my exhaustion throughout the day as well as my lethargic later.

The addition of water to my life, as well as a change in my diet to eating healthier foods on a regular basis have drastically changed the way I feel throughout the day and helped my life over-all. Not to mention I've dropped a decent amount of weight as well.
This lady never drinks water??? Weird.
A good Mom would give him milk and cookies.  &#3232;\_&#3232;
Shame on USA Today.  How much did Coke pay them to run this ad?
That was hard to read with a straight face. 
It's mostly BS but I do like this: 

A: We don't make recommendations on what kids should drink. But a 12-ounce can of Coke has 140 calories, the same as a lunch-box-size bag of pretzels.

I know parents will not give their child soda but will absolutely give them pretzels, chips, and other junk food. It's silly.
This is from the summer of 2012... is it still news?
Is there anything wrong with replacing sodas with 0 calorie sodas like Pepsi Max or Coke Zero?
Oh fuck you, you lying sociopath.  You wouldn't let your children drink Coca-Cola in a million years.
if y'all didn't see [this article about artificial sweetners tied to obesity and diabetes 2](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2013/02/15/artificial-sweetners-diet-nutrition.html) you should check it out. i think the soft drink industry is about to have their tobacco industry moment.
I think the guy must still be living in the 50's.  Reminds me of [this ad](http://i.imgur.com/UOTZGTy.jpg).
I had to double check i wasn't reading the Onion during this interview.
Everything there is wrong on so many levels. The fact is, people who are so addicted to sugary drinks and foods have their cellular process altered to a point where it will be next to impossible to put down those things. They do kill you. Slowly, but they are killing you. What happened to eating fresh foods and stuff we like any other life form were meant to eat? Those who do that, live a lot longer and healthier. It seems to me they are either completely clueless or do in fact know what processed sugars do on a molecular level. I am speaking of course about corporate suits. Those with medical degrees already know what is happening to the cell while its being fed massive amounts of acids and sugar. All diseases are because of lots of salt, processed sugars and highly acidic foods, drinks. Kids especially do not need this drink. A home made juice or a good balanced meal with lots of outside activity is all they need. Not video games that take hours in front of tv computer but a healthy lifestyle. At 32 and a male I do not even get sick and my skin is like baby skin. And I do drink coffee no sugar once in a while.
Don't forget the FDA approved Aspartame that definitely will not attribute to cancer!
I'm too uncaffeinated to find a gif of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4bftQ4xxFc), sorry.

**edit** it's a joke, folks.  Now that I've had my coffee and feel better, I've upvoted this person for being 100% correct.
caffeine is okay if you follow it with a glass of water
she gets all her hydration from her hydration beverages manufactured by her hydration company.  
heavy whipping cream and double-stuffed Oreos.
Quite right! 

I don't get the whole fizzy drinks thing anyway. We weren't allowed them as children because cavities, his father never got them because *his* father thought sugar was The Devil, our son never got them because cavities & no known nutritive value, and guess what? None of us misses fizzy drinks, wants fizzy drinks, or craves sugar.

The only thing Coca Cola is good for, is to keep hangover nausea at bay.
10 kilos.
the problem is how your body processes those calories and how easy it is to consume. We have vending machines in schools now and I remember I used to drink two sodas a day in school because I just didn't fucking know any better.
There are some potential issues with the 0 calorie options:  
1. 0 calorie sodas will have some amount of calories (FDA regulations allow anything with <5 calories to be listed as 0)  
2. The sugar substitutes used have a myriad of potential side effects that have been shown in some studies (though this is only a correlation, not a proven direct cause yet in many cases)  
3. The sugar substitutes can cause cravings without truly satisfying them, leading to increased consumption and weight gain without realizing. They can also play havoc with your natural blood sugar and insulin levels due to potentially stimulating an insulin release.

These are off the cuff (I'm at work so I don't have time to pull up any major research articles), so if I have misquoted I welcome corrections.
Fake sugar is worse for you than hfcs. You're better off switching to soda with real sugar. A calorie is a calorie, but it isnt the only factor.

edit: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892765/
You obviously have no (little) kids at home. 

I too, once, was never sick. Now I'm sick three+ times a year and went on antibiotics twice last year. My diet now is better than it has ever been, but it's not enough to overcome the power of children participating in a herd of children (aka: society).

Kids may have been healthier before but it was because they spent their time outside alone or in small groups, not in small rooms with recirculated air with dozens of other kids.
Fun fact. Dick Cheney was CEO of Searle at the time Aspartame was approved by the FDA.
Yea after a good workout I love to rehydrate with a coke...
There are [Mega Stuffs](http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2013/02/12/review-nabisco-limited-edition-mega-stuf-oreo/) now...
You realize that cookies and milk have more sugar that a Coke, right? And a lot of fats, too. 
Not sure about other places, but the schools in my area don't offer anything sugary in vending machines. 
Well fuck. I completely quit drinking full calorie soda last year and switched to 0 calorie 3-4 times a week. I guess I could try water.
Worse how? HFCS has mercury in it, among other things.
Isn't America Great? /s
I like to hydrate my Coca-Cola by injecting it with Coca-Cola, infusing my hydration beverage with the unparalleled hydration compound found only in Coca-Cola.
Depends on the size of the Coke and the kind of cookies, and when children are growing they need fats too. 

But the point is that cookies and milk also contain nutrients, which Coke doesn't. There's a significant amount of vitamin A in butter, and traces of other vitamins, good things in nuts, flour, and eggs. If it's an oatmeal raisin cookie, for example, the oats will contain minerals. Milk contains protein and calcium. A homemade cookie will probably contain more goodness than a store-bought one, of course.

One of the oddest things about the way Americans eat is how pathologised and compartmentalised food categories have become. It's all: carbs and proteins and fats; as if those things existed in isolation. 
Depend on the coockies which is why americains are so obese : I'll do the right thing and will gives my chidren milk and Oreo... which is just as caloric. I Had milk and a grany  (11g of sugar for two biscits). The problem is that to many of what is available in the states is crap.
A can of coca cola has 39g of sugar.  An oreo has 6.5g and a glass of milk as 11-12g.
many school districts across the country form partnerships with these companies in order to get much needed funding. some contracts even stipulate quotas that must be met. it's all very sickening.
YOU ARE MISSING OUT BECAUSE MOUNTAIN "THINKING CAP" DEW IS THE BEST DRINK AND YOUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IS DEPRIVING CHILDREN OF IT
Fish also has mercury but I know that's beside the point. HFCS doesn't necessarily contain mercury. If the goal was to lose weight (as is the focus with 0 calorie food stuffs) than switching to a soda with aspartame is worse than sticking with hfcs or switching to real sugar.
Because people only eat 1 Oreo at a time, right? 

11g - milk

6.5g - Oreo X 5

~42g of sugar, plus fats.

What was your point again?


a glass of milk also contains several nutrients and ~16g of protein
Okay. 
Can you cite some data on that? It seems metabolically that sugar is worse for you, unless you fail PKU test.
Here is one to start:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892765/
Here is all you need to know about the article. 
>"The fence will not restrict public access as it will have pass-throughs and step overs at trail crossings, and the access status of the area will not change. The fence will exclude pigs thus providing a greater level of protection for native plants," Dan Dennison, Senior Communications Manager for Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources said in an email.
Goddamn it's Standing Rock all over again.
That's socialism for you. Encouraging people to eat healthy when we're trying to profit from sugary garbage food.
Good for him.
Why does this guy only make news when he has something sensible to say? Show me some dirt on him, guys.

What's the big deal compared to "buy USA" slogans?
Correct me if I'm wrong on this and please forgive any ignorance I might have on the issue, but from what I've read from the article he's encouraging the citizens of Venezuela to eat healthy, abstain from drugs and alcohol.  So what I'm wondering is why would promoting fruit juice over soda be a bad thing if it was all natural?  I prefer juice over soda and it seems that if it's natural it wouldn't be as bad.  Yes I am aware that there is sugar in juice but aren't they better for you than say cane sugar or corn syrup?
At least he's promoting a healthy lifestyle, but still his hatred for US companies can be detected even in the stratosphere.

How is sugary garbage food not socialism? The only reason it is so profitable is massive subsidies.
How is that sensible?

Consumers should be able to drink whatever brand they want to. If Coca-Cola or Pepsi is what someone wants to drink, then that person should be able to drink it. If the state owned fruit juice company really wants to compete then they should make a competent final product. And if a product is competent, there should be no need for saying, "Hey please buy this lesser desired product and feel bad for us because we make an incompetent product that can't sell itself."
I totally agree. I don't understand those saying juice is just as bad as coke because it contains sugars too. As far as I know sugars are needed in quite large quantities just to survive. Plus fruit juice has vitamins which soda usually lacks.
He's Venezuelan. His birthright does not require him to enjoy *any* foreign influence. 

It's no different here in America. Do you know how many people here hate Chinese companies right now? Can you imagine the backlash if you were to tell any of those people to just suck it up?
Was about to say the same thing.  Fruit juice might sound good but it's still Basicly sugar water.
He's not forcing anybody to drink anything. He gave advice which, if followed, may improve the health and wealth of his country. He did so while on the national stage. This kind of dialogue is usually called "leadership".

"Hey guys, I know you like your soda pop, but the juice we make here at home is better for you and puts some of your neighbors to work."

I don't see the issue.

Edit: Stop downvoting him you hivemind dipshits.
Rather drink fruit juice than soda any damn day, despite the fact I mostly drink water. Fuck coke n pepsi.
[deleted]
It's not that it's mostly water it's that they both contain boat loads of sugar.  Drinking sugar water is bad for u no matter if it comes from soda or juice.  

Hugo isn't doing any real service saying drink juice instead of soda.

If kids stopped drinking soda and started drinking as much juice they'd be just as fat.
Well I'll just say this, you can pour coca-cola on a grease stain on your driveway, and it'll clean it, let's see some apple juice do that. Not to mention soft drinks have chemicals in them to suppress you from gagging, from oversweetness.

http://www.limelife.com/blog-entry/5-Uses-for-CocaCola-Besides-Drinking-It/138730.html

In any case, this isn't a problem for me, I drink mostly water. I do indulge in the occasional juice from time to time(make it myself from fresh fruits), which I much rather consume, over anything with high fructose corn syrup(most sodas, and a lot of "juices").
I've been drinking large quantities of fruit juice all my life. I am not overweight. Sugar exists in many types and is essential for humans to survive. The motto "all sugars are bad" is false.
[deleted]
I never claimed you will or will not become fat by drinking this or that. You did.

You want to cast doubt on my statement that sugars are essential for humans?
Well they are diet versions of the original drink, also you better have some damn good attorneys to go up against Coke and Pepsi with something as tedious as this
Money talks when it come to government lobbiest's. diet soda is an oxymoron. Like jumbo shrimp and pretty ugly.
That's ridiculous. Diet soda has less than 5 calories per serving. How is that not "diet"?
How is that diet?
Its SODA. Its not food. It is a treat. It isnt required to sustain life. 
I wonder how many fatties out there drink a bunch of it and thinks there is no negative impact
[deleted]
Well no shit, it's not the only thing I'm eating. Diet soda is also like 99% water. You can drink just diet soda and get all the daily water you need from it. And no, diet soda isn't a "treat". Regular sugar soda should be considered a treat. Diet soda is literally just flavored carbonated water with caffeine. Or if you're like me and drink caffeine free diet coke, no caffeine at all.
I am one of those fatties that drink caffeine free diet coke because I like the taste of it and it's certainly better than drinking full on sugar loaded coke.
What makes that fit the definition of the word diet 
So your addicted to it. Maybe you need help
I hate Diet Coke but I like Coke Zero. I wonder what the difference is
That's cute
Tell me what you think is addicting about *Caffeine Free* Diet Coke.
I've heard a rumor that Diet Coke is based on the "New Coke" recipe while Coke Zero is based off the "Coke Classic" recipe. Kinda doubt its true, but I've heard it said lol. 
Same foe my boyfriend but that's because I managed to get him to switch from straight coke to coke zero.
It's funny because you're implying that he's being pretentious while being even more pretentious yourself! I get it!
Isn't that like exactly what the Wikipedia says about it?
Money is the universal language
Everyone on my twitter feed who self describes as a "libertarian" is outraged. Empathy for me, but not for thee. American Conservatism 101.
Also one of languages sung is Keres a Native language spoken in New Mexico. 
It is a fucking commercial. Who gives a shit.
The third- to fifth--to-last paragraphs are very powerful: 

*The xenophobic protesters had one thing right: we do speak English in America. We speak it on official business and in Super Bowl broadcasts; we use it in publications like this one.*

*But that’s not all we do. People like my immigrant mother and her immigrant sisters learn English as adults and raise their kids to speak it, and also speak French and Arabic at family get-togethers and on phone calls. We speak English in school and Spanish with grandparents and Spanglish with friends. We speak Creole and Chinese and Tagalog sitting down to family dinners–maybe with a bottle or two of Coke around the table, which is why Coke is smart to recognize this.*

*We come to America, in other words, and we become American–but we don’t erase everything else that we were before, we don’t forget our cultures and languages as if they never existed, and we don’t hide them as if they’re shameful or less than patriotic. We bring them out and share them, and they make this country better and stronger. America isn’t weakened because people don’t submit to a monoculture; it’s strong because it can absorb the peoples and aspirations and talents of the rest of the world without erasing their cultures.*
I personally found that commercial to be very cringe worthy. It was just this awkward, weird ass forced diversity commercial. I have no clue why they did it, other than to maybe score brownie points with leftists? Also, I find it hilarious coca cola turns up with this after all the fuckery they've done in 3rd world nations lately. 
TL;dr

Too much pretentious responding to drama about a coke ad.
Powerful is definitely the right word for it. 
You seem to implicate that being pro-diversity is leftist, wouldn't that make the right anti-diversity? I remember another [group](http://icplibrary.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wes_003.jpg) that was anti-diversity.
Some fine apologetics you're peddling there.
Leftist here. No brownie points scored. Reevaluate your conception of "leftist."
I can't tell, is that a Tea Party rally or the Republican National Convention?
Obviously I didn't. I was criticizing their ham fisted attempt to say,"see we're so not racist. Look how many skin colors we included in this ad?"  It isn't real, and is just simply a means to group acceptance. 

The left has this perpetual I'm so not racist competitions. Whereas the right doesn't care about forced diversity. They can integrate if they want. 
Thanks for understanding that a Leftist is not necessarily tolerant of other people or cultures. That's ~~got~~ for progressives and liberals. 
Well, I hadn't heard you guys had duly elected a spokesperson. This will make things much easier now. 
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not a "progressive" or a "liberal". It takes more than some kind of "profound" advertisement by one of the most notorious abusers of human rights in the world to make me giddy inside. 

Enjoy Coke-A-Cola.
Keep away from the generalizations and you won't come off as such a tool.
I'm agreeing with you. 
Lol keep away from conversations, and people probably will stop being giant dicks to you. 
Oh. Good :)

Everyone knows there was coke in it...
Lots of people know *coca*-cola had cocaine in it. 

It's not like the fucking name of the soda company has the actual plant name in their brand... /s


Dumbass
I hope these will be like the great high fructose corn syrup ads
Everything that soda companies say is a lie. Stop drinking this crap because not only will you be more healthy, but you won't lose bone density. With age yes but very slow. Phosphoric acid binds to calcium and removes it from your body. As for the ones with sugar well sugar is basically white death and poison. No fiber, messes with the way your body produces energy so your levels go up and down and you feel tired craving more food, sugar to function. It's a drug. Nature has a balance of caffeine, sugars, vitamins, minerals, fiber, proteins and fats or in one phrase amino acids. Soda even with real sugar so no HFCS is still bad. HFCS is a lot worse because it bypasses normal metabolism and the body does not really know how to process that molecule completely. It's not found in nature. Glucose, fructose, lactose are found in nature and in quantities sufficient for life and function throughout the day. 
I couldn't say if aspartame is safe or not, but I don't like it because it makes my throat burn and the roof of my mouth itch. So I won't be using it.
Aspartame turns into Formaldehyde when exposed to heat. It wasn't legal until Monsanto assumed the FDA chairperson position, and self-legalized it.

Do not consume aspartame! It is carcinogenic and has been clinically shown to slow down your metabolism, in addition to other negative effects in your body.
Aspartame is the most tested FDA chemical and is still shown to be safe. Ya, your body CANT tell between corn sugar and sugar because they are the same. But the worst part is idiots that proclaim foul are just falling for the marketing against these products, just like they did FOR these products. Go have a smoke while you suntan and complain about aspartame. 
[Corn sugar](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I1SlBjbG7BQ&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI1SlBjbG7BQ) or real sugar? Your body can't tell the difference because you will die early, hooray!
that's why you make your own soda. 
Or they could just real sugar. 
what other product are people marketing? water? 
Imma just leave that here for you along with all the down votes. http://rense.com/general33/legal.htm
Coca-cola? 
Venezuela has got bigger problems then not having enough coca cola.
Let them drink Coke Zero
Didn't this happen like a week ago?
At least the people there won't be drinking that poison anymore.
Like bread lines....
but iirc zero is much unhealthier than the original one?
at least for a short period. but probably it wont affect anything since they can import sugar from nearby countries?
Not even that
It's my joke
This is going to fall flat (pun intended)... prepare for another "New Coke" fiasco. The reason SodaStream is so popular is because it's seen as a healthy alternative to all the high fructose corn syrup, chemicals and dyes in other soft drinks.

Crystal Pepsi anyone?
Ah, nothing like a steaming cup of Coca Cola in the morning to help you wake up.... 
So is how this works is that I'm supposed to pay coke like twice as much for a coke because I did all the work making it?

Or is how this works that I get 5 cent cokes if I buy this machine?
Soda machines...they keep trying to make soda machines happen. If you could go to the store and get really good coffee in a 2 liter bottle, keurig would never have become a thing. That said, Green Mountain Coffee is probably going to figure out a way to come out on top. 
Soda stream has all those syrupy flavors as well this is no different. 
if its priced similar to k-cups are now, at best it'll be about as cheap as a bottle of coke.
Yes, but you make it yourself and that makes it healthier. /s
Automatically tweeting content submitted by the general public from a corporate twitter account? What could possibly go wrong!
Unfortunate for Twitter they pulled the whole campaign. Was pretty clever up until that point.
Yeah, Coke is a [horrible company](http://org.ntnu.no/attac/dokumentene/cocacola/cokeinfopacket.pdf) they deserve it.
How did ISIS miss out on this?
Coca-Cola "Classic" is NOT the original formula!
The article fails to mention that the New Coke was introduced so that the consumers wouldn't know the difference when the sugar was substituted with CORN SYRUP.
I never got to try New Coke (my parents always drank Pepsi) but would like to taste it just to see how it to compares it to what we have today.

I doubt they would do this but I would like to see Coke sell New Coke, temporarily, as a 'Limited Edition' flavor or something along that line; much like Pepsi does for their various flavors of Mountain Dew.
No, they haven't admitted defeat.  American sheep have finally given in to the HFCS nightmare, and now they think it's perfectly normal that Coke doesn't have sugar in it.

This is an EPIC WIN for Coke over the American public, not a defeat.
I wonder if this means that my vintage "Classic Coke" T-shirt will go up in value?
More like, claiming success!
At my age, if it was around before me, it can be called classic even without a competitor.
Now that there are reports that about HALF of the high fructose corn syrup out there contains mercury (!!!!), and studies showing that it's likely that HFCS is a major cause of the "epidemic of obesity" (because it metabolizes differently than sugar, bypassing some of the body's mechanisms for regulating fat storage), it's totally nuts to consume ANY high fructose corn syrup.  Ever.

So it's time to change the Coke back to the original, and too damned bad if it "costs a bit more" and another American corporation has to reduce a bit of their all-important profits. The trick is to not buy it, and to let them know this is why.  It may work: Note that many "reputable" brands are now selling alternatives -- even Heinz ketchup, which is mostly corn syrup, now sells alternatives that are sugar-based.  Ben and Jerry's ice cream is tricky -- some are made with sugar, others with HFCS.  But just don't drink Coke (or the other little bottles of corn syrup) till they go back to sugar.  Do it for your kids.  
As bizarre as it is, I think this is the result of the Obama election.  Pepsi co-opted the Obama logo design and message, and it's so compelling apparently Coke has to answer in a fashion that makes them seem "new" as well.

In the years of "Change", "Classic" has a negative connotation.

Yes, I think when talking about marketing directions, using quotes around so many words is appropriate.  How the hell does drinking sweetened water stand for anything?  I wish they'd just bring back the taste tests and leave vague ideology out of it.
*Coke fans surely remember the spring of 1985*

Oh yeah, Coca-Cola's formula was at the height of my concerns at the age of eight months!
That's right.  For one thing, they substituted cane sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  So people wouldn't  complain about the new Old Coke formula, New Coke was introduced and Old Coke was removed from the shelves.  It stayed off the shelves until all the Old Coke had been consumed or had gone bad (does Coke go bad?).  Then, because of the public outcry, Coke Classic was "brought back" with an altered formula.

It's not that I'm one of those Coke heads who screamed for their Old Coke hit, it's that I think this was all a brilliant marketing strategy, orchestrated to change Coke's formula to make it easier and cheaper to manufacture.

I guess I'm a Coke Truther...
No, but it did taste a lot more like it than the "new" Coke did.  Coke II (imho) was nasty and overly sweet, like Pepsi.  That was the first time that something had changed and I protested it.  Ended up getting a coupon for a free 6 pack at the time after writing a letter insisting that I would not drink Coke or Pepsi but a local brand - Adirondack.
that stuff is nasty - I did a science project in middle-school where I tested what soda eroded teeth the fastest (the local dentist was a family friend)

Coke was the worst, it could disolve a molar in 35 days.

Drink that shit & you'll regret it.
["The truth is we're not that dumb, and we are not that smart."](http://www.last.fm/music/Negativland/Dispepsi)
In the US, here in Canada, we still use Sugar.
Get a Pepsi, and poor about 3 tablespoons of clear [Karo Syrup](http://www.karosyrup.com/) in it and you will have a rough estimate of the vile sludge that was New Coke.

All the sweetness of Pepsi plus a lasting coating of your mouth for horrendously long lasting after-taste.
It was stupid of Coke to *replace* Coke with New Coke.  They should have sold them in parallel.  Talk about the arrogance to pull the rug from under all your loyal customers and dictating what you think they should prefer to drink.

I really LOVED Pepsi Blue and wish they would bring it back.  I hoarded a bunch of bottles, but they were gone all too soon.
This is an EPIC WIN for corn producers.  I'm sure Coke just wants to use the cheapest form of sugar available, which in the US is HFCS.
WTF?
[deleted]
I drink about 20 ounces of Coke per day, so I know what HFCS Coke tastes like.

I got a bottle of sugar Coke from a bodega this weekend and didn't really notice any difference.  I think the metal vs glass package makes a bigger difference in the taste than HFCS vs sugar.
I agree that New Coke was way too sweet, but I think they did that deliberately so you wouldn't mind the bitter aftertaste left by the "Classic" formula.  If you want the real thing, buy your Coca-Cola from a Mexican market.  They still use sugar south of the border.
After writing my original post, I looked up [New Coke on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_coke#Coke_II).  As it turns out, it **was** sold in parallel after they brought back the 'classic' flavor.  It wasn't completely shuttered as a brand until 2002 in the states and is still sold in some American Territories.

I had no clue.

Edit, I didn't like Pepsi Blue but that's why I agree with you on the parallel marketing; I know there were people that did.
Ok, ok.  Maybe you have a point.  

It's still crap, and it still tastes like crap. =)
They should market Coke PUR, made with real sugar (aka. Canadian/Mexican Coke) - perhaps there is a market that would pay a 25% premium for the "real thing"?
http://adsareculture.blogspot.com/2009/01/pepsi-plagiarism.html
I don't doubt that Coke was popular during that time, I just think it's presumptuous to make the statement the author did because most people, Coke fans or otherwise, born after the seventies don't recall the spring of 1985 at all and even those born in the seventies probably don't specifically remember the fuss over New Coke.  
For me it was never a big difference in taste between HFCS and cane sugar, although HFCS did taste a bit sweeter. The major difference was the aftertaste. HFCS coke always leaves a longer lasting, sickly sweet aftertaste.
Do they still use cocaine too?  That would truly be the original formula.
im looking at a can of coke that uses cane sugar right now. one good reason to live in nz.
Born in the 70s wouldn't remember a story that led the news for days?

Jesus, you tykes and your short memories. Get off my lawn.
I was only a kid back then, but I cared a big deal.  One can only imagine what would happen if they tried pulling a similar stunt today.
I was born in 79 and I remember.
[Actually, real Coca Cola still uses an extract of the Coca leaf, however, the cocaine part has been removed.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca#Industrial_use)
*Get off my lawn*

I will never be able to read or hear that again without thinking of Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino.  "I used to stack little gooks like you five feet high in Korea"
LIES
>The family did not consider Coke was harmful because its labels do not contain warning signs.

Right.  And you can die from drinking too much water, too.  Maybe warning signs should be placed on the tap.
Was she eating Mentos too?
Should have drank diet coke.
For those keeping score, that's roughly 3 and a half 2 liters a day or 13 20 ounce bottles( give or take). I know people with diabetes who don't crave fluid this much.

Recommended fluid intake is somewhere BETWEEN 2 to 3 liters with water intoxication taking place around 4 gallons a day -- including fluids from food.
Best post-death burp ever?

Sadly, the world will never know. ;(
Serving size?
Least surprising news story ever.
30 with 8 kids?

Sounds like a big loss for the genepool.
There's certainly a difference between putting a warning label on something due to its toxic/dangerous nature (gasoline, cigarettes, razor blades, etc.) and just being plain old paranoid.  I'd almost take it as an insult to pick up a bottle of Coke and see a warning label telling me, "Drinking 10 of these bottles will prolly kill ya, dipshit."  This lady obviously lacked the self-control to keep her Coca-Cola addiction straight, and she payed the price for it.  I know that some people *really* like their caffeine, but most people also don't drink 10 liters of *anything* a day.
[removed]
I would tend to agree. Drinking too much water causes the body to absorb the water so that they literally drown. I can't imagine what soda absorption would do. Never mind that that much soda is somewhere in the neighborhood of 3250 calories a day. Did she even eat? There's almost no way to stay thin otherwise. 
Top that off with the consumption of roughly ~420mg of caffeine a day, and you have a real winner here.

It's milk being sold by Coca-Cola. That's the only red flag you need. It's not milk.
Isn't too much calcium bad for you? So much so that drinking too much regular milk could weaken your bones after years of doing it?
What? They own shit loads of brands 
What you don't like Moca-Mola?
There is a certain amount of calcium that can be absorbed at once, and vitamin d has a huge role in that uptake. So any you consume above that point, just passes on through
Assholes and idiots exist in every corner of the earth. This isn't an America-only problem. Over here in Norway, we have morons claiming that the presence of non-Norwegian flags during may 17th (our "independence day", if you will) is a disgrace and a proof that our "souvereignty" is threatened and that we will lose all that is Norwegian.
Well, from what I've heard, the US is a narrow-minded place and I'm not just talking about people in the "bible belt". Most US citizens have a very fierce sense of patriotism and national identity, and even those who don't know very little about the world that exists outside of the US. So they are naturally very scared of things that they consider the "other". Sure it's fine to teach German, French, Filipino, Japanese, Afrikaans in school because you're able to fetishise it (like in the way people get Chinese characters tattooed on themselves), it seems exotic and far-removed. But if you even for one moment assume that anyone wants their national pride associated with anything other than English then you are a FOOL! It's Xenophobia at it's most potent.                           
But on a side note, screw Coca-Cola seriously. They're just trying to appeal to the left-wing demographic. "Oh Coke made an Ad where people of different nationalities are singing the US national anthem! OHMIGAWD how progressive!". And if you think about it, what are they trying to say? Everyone wants to be American? Live in America? Coca-Cola literally exploits under-developed countries to make money.
Going out on a limb here, cause I didn't watch the ad or the Superbowl. When did America the beautiful replace the star spangled banner as the national anthem? 
I cannot understand or empathize with criticisms of this ad. First off, yes, surprise surprise, AMERICA IS DIVERSE! It (almost) always has been. This ad seems to have been showcasing this diversity, and what's wrong with that? Also, this is an ad after all, and the white male isn't their only demographic. 
I don't understand the controversy. America is a diverse place. I'm in the military and even I can understand that not everyone here is a flag-waving corn-fed white boy. Shit, half the people I serve with come from a multitude of different cultural and racial backgrounds. That's not controversial, it's fucking America. That's what we are - a hodgepodge of people from different backgrounds in one place with the shared interest of making things better for ourselves in any way possible.
Quite the cesspool going on in the comment area there.
I thought it was beautiful in all of the languages that were singing it. This is America isn't it? we are the melting pot of peoples after all. Whats wrong with singing it in different languages?
Why do we have to have so many red necks here? They just give people reasons to hate america even more!
They're selling Coke.  They want every demographic they showed to drink Coke.  I don't think it's deep or complicated.  Fewer old white guys are drinking Coke, gotta cultivate and appeal to the emerging markets and a wider demographic. 
who ever said white males were their only demographic?
Come on though, I think Coke knew that it would piss off conservatives and homophobes... and so who would they be targeting? 
it was just a nod to the business agenda of coca cola
And if they do - marketing success!  Everyone talks about them...at least on the Internet. 
that's because it's not just regular milk. it's a targeted specialty milk.  lay off the clickbait titles.  

> Coke says the milk -- priced about $3.98 to $4.20 for a half gallon -- is specially cold-filtered so that it has 50% more protein, 50% less sugar and 30% more calcium than conventional milk.

> But Jones says Fairlife's real competition is from premium, value-added, growth areas of milk, such as organic, soy and lactose-free offerings.
They have been making milk for years!  Just not for sale in America!
Fwiw I work Dairy Dept for a grocery store (Publix).
Product has been on the shelf for several  weeks now.
Not a big seller.
But does it have DHA/Omega 3?
It's still Coca Cola selling milk,  specialty milk or not.
cool, I'm guessing since it's not ultra-pasteurized (like just about all milk these days) it should be possible to make fresh mozzarella with it.

One coke milk please

Why? I'm sure you already buy plenty of brands they own and buy plenty of brands owned by other seemingly unlikely owners such as Nestlé. 
Coke is like bread and beer.  It will weather any storm even if it last a decade.  Apple i doubt the mobile electronics market will be as kind when we look back in 30 years.
Of course they have ! After all they have already [contained](http://www.mycoke.com/htmls/Downloads/iphoneMagicCokeBottle) Coca Cola within their impregnable walls !

Haha! This will surely bankrupt Walmart!
I can't believe people actually thought there was a sugar tax. I try to watch as my items are being scanned and I also check my receipt. One time at Walmart they charge me for 24 red peppers when I only bought 1. I was so pissed I didn't even load my car when I went back it and got a refund.

Yeah, because the problem up until now has been that people just didn't realize that soda is loaded with sugar and calories.

If you are going to get upset about 3 downvotes, you're gonna have a bad time on reddit.
It was sarcasm, just in jest.
Illegal by nature but rarely if ever prosecuted? Figures.
...as they struggle to peddle more sugar-water to people.

Should we really think they're serious?! This is nothing more than a PR stunt/gimmick.
ya it reminds me of the film super size me when they were interviewing the lobbiest for fast food. he represented so many companies that it filled up the screen with the labels lol
So now coke will be flammable?
>The use of BVO as a food additive is currently not allowed in the European Union or Japan.

Once again. Like the americans eggs and apples banned or tons of others foods.
It sounds like they are having problems affording Union labor overhead...
Gawker went and created a controversy for it to report on. It's the natural progression when News is considered to be Entertainment.
I knew there was something up about the coke can being red... J/k
Murca must not only be praised, it must be praised in English. Just like Jesus did.

The best part about this ridiculousness, is that it shows just how dumb these people are when they are mad and they do not even know that "America the Beautiful" is not our national anthem.  Anyone that is outraged about this should buy a one way ticket to anywhere but the United States, because we are a country founded on many cultures.
I'm not mad but it was a really cheesy commercial. 
They were scared because it contained bromine as in it was bound to a fatty acid. I'm guessing they change it because they found a cheaper alternative and not because it was controversial.  Lets be honest every thing that isn't labeled water has controversy from some ignorant nuts.
Coke, you can't hide South America.... Get fucked!
Pool closed due to AIDS. 
Sounds like this could go 2 syaw. It is a huge overpriced success and absolutely delicious, or new coke.
Jeez....get a life already! Do these people really think that Coca Cola was deliberately trying to insult their sister? You just can't cure stupid, can you?
I sure hope coke doesn't go overboard apologizing to these ass-hats.  Say you're sorry they were offended and be done with it.
How many of these ugly Americans were  PLANTED by Coke to drive media blitz, debate, name mentions, and viewership of the commercial?
Planted? Maybe riled up with the commemoration bottle of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement back in June. They are certainly out there, they just haven't had an opportunity like this to speak their mind.
Last year, drinks sold by Coca-Cola in the UK were found to contain pesticides up to 300 times the level allowed in tap or bottled water.
because of my New Years resolution to drink/eat less products with HFCS, I've been avoiding most sodas.  have to keep my eyes open. 
>Historian Mark Pendergrast says the recipe was handed down through the family of Frank Robinson, the commercial partner of chemist John Pemberton, who first produced the drink in the summer of 1886.

>In the third edition of his book, *For God, Country and Coca-Cola: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It*, Pendergrast reproduces what he claims to be the same recipe that Pemberton devised over 125 years ago.

>Coca-Cola has refuted [the] claims, insisting there is only one real copy of the recipe - tucked away in a vault in Atlanta.
