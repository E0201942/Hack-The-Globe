In a similar train of thought, theres also what the United Fruit Company and the other banana republic companies did. Theres avocado companies too that help fund Mexican cartels, chilean companies that buy up water, depriving access to 100s of thousands of people. Shit sucks yo.
Killing cows and humans
The company is called JBS USA Holdings. It is owned by a Brazilian company (JBS S.A.). This company is receiving tens of millions of dollars ($60m+) in subsidies from the Trump administration, despite profits of over $6 billion in just *the first quarter* of 2019. (https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/21344-jbs-awarded-another-round-of-federal-subsidies).

You know, those subsidies that are supposed to go to American farmers because of Trump‘s trade war? Why should our tax dollars help fund an already insanely profitable foreign company that erases the amazon and murders people?
Doesn’t CVS carry their products?  Since CVS stopped carrying tobacco products due to a public outcry, would a similar campaign get these products off their shelves?
My workplace buys from these companies. Pork mostly, all I can politely say is dodge the sliced deli counters at all groceries in Canada and the Midwest and starve out some of the shady profits. I'll find a new job soon enough but I'm ethically compromised everytime I sign an invoice from Brazilian pork.
And this is why I’m trying to cut my meat intake by a lot.
So where does JBS export these amzon beef to?  I mean, I realize that JBS is an american company  but the beef supplied in the US by JBS is largely sourced from the US and not the amazon.  Last time I checked, a lot of the beef exported from Brazil went to countries like China and Australia.

  

EDIT - alright settle down folks, I realize that JBS in the US is a subsidary of JBS Brazil.  If you google JBS MEAT, the first link is "JBS USA" so my bad.

  

Also, I'm mistaken, Austrailia doesn't import beef, they export it and good quality stuff too.
You know how Reddit posts a lot of cute animal gifs, sometimes of cows or pigs or chickens? And how I joked Reddit is trying to turn me vegan? And then I was legitimately considering it once I started cooking more often because handling meat grossed me out and is such a pain to cook and clean and then while I was on the fence Netflix autoplayed Gamechangers and I was like oh shit looks good, watched it and bam 

Pushed me over the fence / broke the camel's back and here I am a vegan since last Nov. Very happy to be one and not contribute to the environmental damage caused by the animal livestock industry...
Duh.  Animal agriculture is the reason we are tearing up the Amazon so fast.
This article title is highly misleading and is wrong in its insinuation that JBS had anything to do with this particular case or was really involved at all. The killings took place due to disputes over land that was to be logged for the suspects timber business. The fact that he later sold cows to JBS is incidental. The sale of cows was likely illegal but that case has literally nothing to do with the massacre and is a different issue entirely.
You mean other than the millions of animals they kill?
This thread is bananas
From the article:

> The quick sale of the cattle suggests what environmentalists call “cattle laundering” – when cattle from a farm that has environmental issues sells cattle to a “clean” farm. This gets around monitoring systems because meat companies including JBS do not monitor these “indirect suppliers”.

So it's not like JBS was actually involved.

Breaking news: meat industry linked to billions of deaths a year

Every person associated with the meat/dairy industry is responsible for massacres on a daily basis.
Agricultural scientist here. Just a reminder to folks that the Amazon is a horrible place for row crops or even grazing cattle. The soil is very poor there, and when you think of nutrient rich rainforests, that's really detritus that can be quickly depleted when you break that land up.

This isn't the case for much of the rest of the world when it comes to cattle. In the US for example most cattle, even grain-finished, are raised on pasture and spend the majority of their life on it (if not nearly all in the case of breeding cows). That land actually is suited for grass and needs disturbances like grazing to maintain those ecosystems, but that soil isn't the right quality for row crops.

If you got entirely rid of livestock in the US as the most extreme example, you'd only decrease greenhouse gas emissions by [2.6% at best.](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/48/E10301.full.pdf) (the authors basically say this is negligible) A lot of that has to do with about [86% of the things livestock eat](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html) not competing with human use, cattle recycling crop residue and poor quality grain we cant use, eating grass and maintaining pastures that can be [better carbon sinks than trees](https://climatechange.ucdavis.edu/news/grasslands-more-reliable-carbon-sink-than-trees/), etc. 

The above is *NOT* the case for the Amazon, but  the Amazon also should not be cherry-picked to represent livestock across the world either. This is often a confusing point for students I've come across that have heard about the Amazon in school, but don't have much background in general agriculture, and is often a problem in these subjects too.
Probably already posted here but JBS roughly translates to English, SGE: Soylent Green Enterprises.
Amazon right now, " no Miss Karen. We are not massacring  anyone, that is a different amazon. No you can not speak with my manager, i am not covering anything up."

I think problem lies within us also. Consumers especially in USA want Bananas for cheap , how will the suppliers get them ? This is where UFC comes into pic. Some politicians in USA( senators) will have indirect partnership in UFC and provide cheap Bananas to customers in USA. Only way to teach them an lesson is to form independent groups and constantly inspect locations for environmental damages and provide unbiased reporting to the Public . All the rich( walmart,amazon,dell,dow, Koch ,car manufacturing)  people in USA are directly or indirectly involved in messing up this planet.
It was already a massacre. They just branched into more species
*In addition to the brutal massacre that they carry out on a daily basis.

This shit is so unfuckingbelievable to me these days.  The amazon is like a world resource EVERYONE depends on, and right now _this_ is the level of barbarism overseeing it?  It's no wonder it's being destroyed.  We're fucked as a species.  All the stupidest most rotten pieces of shit on the planet reside in places that we ultimately depend on (like the white house.)

As linked to in the rest of em.
For anyone who never heard of this... United Fruit Company is now known as Chiquita.
This particular case is very different to those examples you gave. For example in the case of United Fruit they would directly take over countries using US military or paramilitary forces and then either directly take control of the land or give the land to locals who were then contracted to plant and sell bananas exclusively to United Fruit. This case was basically that a guy who owned land killed a bunch of people squatting on his land and then also incidentally sold some cows to another guy who then sold those cows to JBS. The murder wasn't related to the sale of cows and shouldn't be treated as a related event. The title of the article is highly misleading.
Capitalism put profits over people, massacres aren't a side affect, it's a direct result of it. ***"It's not a bug, it's a feature".***
This is why I have a problem when other Americans look at the Central and South American countries and say things like "America first, let those people deal with their own problems!"

Check out the Netflix show, Rotten. It talks about the negative side of bottled water, avocado etc.
Eat local. I buy my food at the farmer’s market mostly.
Yeah, I don't know why some people think the good industry can't be into organized crime.  It's not immune to corruption just because it's food.

You don't read about the early stages in your high school history classes.
I'm from El Salvador and everytime I see one of those Chiquita trucks moving on my streets, I just want to burn them all to ashes. Those companies literally overthrew entire governments just because they would lose some lands that were going to be given to the actual citizens of the country and give the workers basic fucking human rights. 

Fuck you US interference. I ain't got nothing against the average, decent human being US citizen, but fuck you US companies and all companies that ruin lifes and the environment just to prop up that bottom line. Just fuck you.

They sell meat at CVS?
CVS stopped caring tabacco because they offer health insurance.  It has nothing to so with public outcry, but they did market it that way.
They stopped selling tobacco because it wasnt profitable anymore not because of outcry
Likewise. The mega companies that control most of the mass produced and processed food are largely fuking evil. The meat industry is doubly so. There's no such thing as corporate meat that's ethically sourced.

JBS is a Brazilian company with U.S. subsidiaries.
Dude what are you talking about? JBS is a Brazilian company, the owners are even involved in operation car wash.   
  
But answering your question the main buyers of Brazilian beef are China, Hong Kong, the EU, the Arab World(afaik specially Egypt and the Emirates), Iran and Russia, but by far the 2 biggest are China and Hong Kong
You can find Brazilian canned corned beef products in the US.  Lots of grocery stores carry it; check out the canned meat section next time you're shopping and there's a good chance you'll find one.  But other than that, I don't think I've ever seen it in anything else here in the US.
Australia imports Brazilian beef? Not sure about that.
While reddit is collectively sandbagging you, any country can be a net exporter of something but that doesn't mean they don't import it. The US exports a ton of oil but we also import a ton of oil. Australia is a net exporter of beef but that doesn't mean they don't import any beef at all.
As of last week, the US Dept. of Agriculture passed a ruling that will lift the ban on imported beef from Brazil. Pork has been imported from Brazil for some time.

You are absolutely right but your comment is also misleading. The article also talks about how JBS committed in 2009 to not buy meat from farms practicing illegal deforestation.

>JBS and other big companies such as Marfrig committed to not buying from farms involved in illegal deforestation in two separate agreements signed with Greenpeace and Brazilian prosecutors in 2009 and subsequent years.

Turns out, not only they didn't respect their commitment, the company they bought from is also linked to a massacre...

They also declared this after signing the agreement; 
>“We monitor over 280,000 square miles, an area larger than Germany, and assess more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day, as well as conducting daily checks of all purchases to ensure compliance with strict standards. To date we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance,”

Basically, they knew what they were doing...

No kidding
I agree with many of the points that you make. Agriculture systems can be improved with animals. Americans are not buying meat from South America. Despite that, raising and killing animals is still fucked up. Breeding them, killing them while they're as young as they can be. Raising animals en masse still comes with its own problems--chiefly that livestock account some 66% of terrestrial mammal mass. More than a quarter of the Earth's terrestrial non-ice surface is used to facilitate livestock. 

You can make an idealists argument all you want, but in an ideal world we don't need to account for economics while weighing the value of life--therefore it would be erroneous to say that we can feed more humans and increase crop yield by killing and eating animals.

From an idealists perspective, there is a whole lot more that we can do to improve agriculture while working alongside of animals without killing or artificially breeding them.
I too can cherry pick stats that make animal agriculture in the US not look so bad. The reality is that the number of cattle required to meet the demand of US meat consumption does not fall into this and will destroy grasslands if transitioned to pastured raised. Most meat eaten in the US are raised on CAFOs and they are terribly polluting.
Capitalists from outside the region.

Same if you eat anything from some fruit providers that fund cartels,
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.  The word “Capitalism” describes nothing more than a system where people are free to own private property and engage in voluntary trade. Period.  

19th century America had the most free market state-capitalist society that the world has ever seen.  According to Nobel Prize winning economist Dr. Milton Friedman, who is widely considered one of the greatest economists of all time, it saw the largest outpouring of charitable activity in recorded history and also saw the most rapid expansion in the standard of living of the poor before or since. It would have been even more rapid had the government not deprived blacks and women of equal rights. All of the evidence shows that free market capitalism lifts people out of poverty faster than any other economic system.
The free market is driving meat alternatives at an all time high.

Your point is mute.

Don't eat meat? Is that not an option?
Hunt it yourself.
Main thing is to not waste what you buy, make sure as little of it is thrown away. This can help cut down the total amount that you buy.
I know some people who buy only local meats amd dairies, you can look into that?
Get two cows or any type of animal. Breed them, wait five minutes, breed them again, and boom you got a decent animal farm
There are a lot of pretty decent alternatives to meat now. Try them out. The best way to not support the meat industry is to not give them your money.
Murder has never had any correlation with the existence of capitalism
They weren't caught adding cardboard to the meat. They were caught bribing food-safety inspectors. The police investigation happened to uncover a conversation about cardboard which was just ambiguous enough that it could be either about using cardboard in packaging or about mixing it with ground meat. News outlets jumped to that conclusion by themselves. No cardboard was ever found in the meat and that part of the conversation was not used as evidence in any prosecution.
God what a messed up turn of events. Anyone who’s interested in learning more, look up Jacobo Árbenz.

Having a chief officer in Eisenhower’s cabinet, UFC convinced him that the “socialist Guatemalan problem” had to be taken care of, resulting in the CIA backing a dictator that would take Árbenz down and institute decades of dictatorship after dictatorship in Guatemala. All because UFC (Chiquita) couldn’t have their profits tampered with

But communism killed X-million people.

Turns out, it's the personality type incharge.
The sad part is none of this is ever attributed to capitalism. It's always "gang violence" or "obesity" or whatever else.

People like to throw around how many people died *directly because* of communism, while ignoring unbelievable amounts of death because the cause of death didn't directly say "Capatalism".

You'll never know capatalism's toll on human life. You'll never get a number on how many lives were lost to it.

That’s less capitalism itself but more just pure greed and tyranny. Every economic and political structure can be (and has been or currently is) abused by fucked up people. Russia/USSR & China with communism. Venezuela with socialism. Many European and American companies with capitalism. It’s not just a capitalism thing; it’s a people thing. If some rich and powerful businesspeople and politicians want to do shit their way, they’ll figure out how to skirt the laws to get their way regardless of the structure that is present.

Edit: There are a lot of companies out there, big and small, that grow because of capitalism but also contribute a lot to ESG initiatives (economic, social, and governance); in fact, it is a new thing many companies are pursuing more of lately, trending in the business of told especially in the US.

This is exactly the reason that a system of checks and balances was designed. Obviously we need to re-adjust things because they've changed over time but Capitalism is the best system we have by a long shot. It is real easy to pretend all the bad things are because of Capitalism. Communism sounds great on paper but has turned out to be a disaster literally every time. You're oversimplifying.

Unfortunately, every year they are put out of business by horrible corporations which destroy the land, communities and the ecology.
The problem is, their eyes don't see this far. People love their families and friends and they feel it's enough and care stops there. That's why journalists and activists that try to bring these stories to our attention face so much danger.

How do you ethically source killing an animal that doesn’t want to die? Lmaoo. Not a vegan but still.
What about lab grown meat? Not defending them just giving an answer
I mean, how can any meat be ethically sourced? Even if you’re nice to the cows on your farm, it’s almost worse that they’ll follow the people they trust right into the slaughterhouse.
Even if you don't want to take the vegan lifestyle, just cutting down on meat consumption hurts the industry. Even more so, if you can find local farmers that will let you pick out a cow and buy it. You get all the meat from that specific cow, and it's usually enough to fill an large freezer for a years worth of food. Doing this you can find a place that isn't a mega corporation that treats their animals like shit, their workers like shit, and the Earth like shit.
They also say they are one of the largest beef suppliers in Canada. 

From Google:
> jbsfoodcanada.ca

> JBS Canada is one of Canada's largest beef companies, with more than 2600 team members from across Canada and the Globe, providing the best Canadian ...

Reading the wikipedia article about bribes over $150,000,000 in Brazil. Illegal actions directed by the owner brothers with corporate control, and possible prosecution in the US for corruption. They were banned from importing products to EU and China for a time due to bribing of food inspection workers/agency. Acceptance of wrong doing in one case and agreeing to a $3.2 billion dollar fine over 25 years for leniency and to avoid legal consequences. 

I cannot fathom why Canadian Retailers and restaurants trust their products or why the Canadian Government would trust them to be one of the largest meat producers in Canada? There seems to be no chance they were not also committing illegal actions everywhere they operate. 

Maybe the problem is with the wealthy using Capitalism as an excuse to destroy the planet and behave immorally without consequence as long as it is  profitable. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS_S.A.
Those are the main importers of Brazilian beef. The main buyers of Brazilian beef are still the Brazilians themselves. The domestic market accounts for 80% of Brazilian beef consumptions. Brazilians love their beef.
 Trader Joe’s has it. Back when you had to label where your meat was from, most of their steaks said Brazil.
I think he’s mistaken. JBS has huge beef operations in Australia and export from there to Asia. I doubt they import much to Aus.
NZ does. Literally every canned beef tin in the stores I've ever checked was Brazilian.
Ahh that's OK, I should probably double check my info before I post it anyways.  But you're right, countries do import/export all the time.

Giving your money to corporations that murder/rape/torture DOES make you responsible.
They are.
Please don't be misleading. Practically all of those cattle you talk about are already pasture raised even if a portion of them go to CAFOs to finish. For those not familiar with how cattle are raised, I suggest reading this [USDA overview](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/sector-at-a-glance/), especially with respect to cow-calf operations (charts get updated annually, but the text has been pretty similar since the Obama administration). Not to mention that I'm citing pretty well supported peer-reviewed literature otherwise.

What can't be supported is doing grass-finishing with all those cattle, and that's entirely different than grass-fed even though many people mistakenly use grass-fed to describe grass-finished while assuming grain-finished cattle aren't eating grass. 

These are all common misconceptions in this subject us scientists end up debunking pretty often. It's not cherrypicking in that context. Otherwise I'd be cherrypicking every time I debunked a climate change denier. That's just simply the reality that a lot of people unfamiliar with the subject get way off-base on.
Yeah, the interventionist United States has been doing bad things for a long time unfortunately.
>The word “Capitalism” describes nothing more than a system where people  are free to own private property and engage in voluntary trade. Period.

That has to be the worst definition of capitalism that I ever heard of.  So that means a small community in the Bronze Age was capitalist because they practiced trade and owned private property?

Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production and consequential extraction of surplus value from this ownership for capital accumulation, in a market-base society.
Reddit seems inundated lately with people who equate capitalism with “everything I don’t like about America...” it’s rather disappointing how quickly these folks are ready to discard private property and thrust us all into being wards of the state.

look up the U.S intervention that led to the [Salvadorian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War). Units of the Atlacatl battalion which were created and trained in the U.S School of Americas led the [Mozote Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre), just one massacre of many in the war. [The guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_D'Aubuisson) who ordered the hit on archbishop Oscar Romero was also trained in the US School  of Americas, he was a leader of the death squads that killed and tortured many civilians during the war, death squads trained in the U.S. He was known as "blowtorch" for his interrogation techniques.

This war destabilized the country, yet Americans wondered why so many Salvadorians fled to the U.S
America should provide a substantially lot more aid and let economic refugees in given the American government is partially responsible for all the mess.
Aka democracy export
And a ton of people here (Guatemala) do believe that version of events - that there WAS a socialist problem, that there was no US intervention, and that we saved ourselves from "becoming another Venezuela".

Republic bananera for LIFE.
The government at the time was a bit sick of the fruit company, especially since Arbenz was essentially just beating them at their own game. They dodged taxes for years by depreciating their land, then complained when Arbenz expropriated it paying them more than what they claimed it was worth.

The big irony is that the coup actually led to the company’s decimation after the US government, sick of their shit, brought antitrust action against them and broke up the company.
Imagine that young men who have no idea of the politics behind things like this fly there to risk their lifes for the profit of companies.
Not just Guatemala. The United States of America engaged in activity like this countless times throughout this period in South America. It could even be said that the US is largely at fault for the state of South America today, with all the destabilisation, coups, funding brutal drug militias, etc.
Nick calluthur has a good book on this. What your post fails to mention is the Cold War hysteria being a huge part of the decision making process in overthrowing arbenz. Arguably more so than any push by United fruit company.
Confessions of an economic hitman. This is standard policy to this day.
I don’t understand how this could even still be a turn of events. We know they toppled governments. We know that the corporation itself and all its entities should be liquidated and redistributed to competition. And yet we sit here eating our Chiquita bananas squabbling over forum posts like this and nothing changes.
Reading up on Wikipedia about the Banana Republics is a good idea to give a decent overview.
There’s a book called 
“Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World,” that’s pretty decent.

Edit: punc.
Literally just Google "banana republic", or the 1954 Guatemalan coup.
Freakonomics podcasts did one on bananas which was remarkably interesting and they definitely discussed Banana Republics a bit

What is on this picture for somebody who doesn't want to watch a graphic image?
This is exactly right. No -ism ever killed anyone. Turns out, it was people the whole time.
yeah but they do it in the economic context of capitalism
Yeah, psychos in power is the problem.  The issue with that is that there's not really any governmental system that doesn't inherently favor ruthlessness, so you have to instill preventative measures through laws.  But those laws are invariably going to be eroded in times of emergency and psychos will eventually infiltrate any government.  Only solution I can see is an immortal, benevolent AI dictatorship.
I don’t agree.  The lesson of the Holocaust is that *everyone* is capable of evil.  We can’t just point and say “Well that guy there is the problem!” because this is what humanity is and does.

Edit: in case someone gets confused why I’m bringing up the Holocaust, it’s not because it’s in any way directly relevant, it’s just an example.  History is full of atrocity on atrocity and we’re even shitty to one another about the good things we do.
Nit if the economic system revolves around class based hierarchies. You cant reform capitalism to the point where this never happens
Trickel down isn't a pure economic principle. It's largely political and I don't know of many who speak of it except for reddit saying it doesn't work.  If we are talking about tax breaks here they usually will fall universally through classes or a particular sector for specific reasons e.g to stimulate.
Or we can just have workers own the means through unions and co-ops
>Venezuela with socialism.

People need to seriously research more what's going on in Venezuela. It is **not due to socialism.** The US is directly responsible for aggravating the situation that was caused by crashing oil prices resulting in hyperinflation. **It is an orchestrated crisis** This is the Shock Doctrine right before our eyes.

[US caused Venezuela's hyperinflation](https://youtu.be/m4spncQg3Fw)


>While Venezuela has moved away from free-market capitalism, its economy is hardly socialist. The private sector, not the state (and still less the social economy), controls the overwhelming majority of economic activity. Between 1999 and 2011, the private sector’s share of economic activity increased, from 65 percent to 71 percent.




Btw, Venezuela under chavez was never repressive. In fact, his programs greatly helped the poor.


>inflation and unemployment were both considerably lower during Chávez’s years as president, compared to the years before he took office (with unemployment declining significantly from 2003 on). 

.

>Under Chávez the government significantly increased spending on healthcare, education, and social services. Access to food, housing, and basic utilities was partially decommodified through state subsidies and price controls. This led to dramatic reductions in poverty, inequality, and child malnutrition, major increases in school and university enrollments, and a quadrupling of the number of pensioners.

Lmao who upvoted this illiteracy?  Economic structures aren’t going to be defined very usefully by Fox News.  None of the countries you listed have anything to do with the ideologies you matched them with.😝
not to mention how the oldest and model capitalistic societies are doing just fine. the likelyhood of your country being in bad shape and home to a massacre is connected to how recently capitalism was embraced by your people. we don't soo this shit in northern europe, the birthplace of modern capitalism.
There is no capitalism that doesn't become predatory. Whether by increment or in one fell swoop.
Power does this. Centralized power needs to be dismantled.
Who do you think runs capitalism? Does capitalism just exist out in nature?
Of course it’s the people’s fault. But the system that allowed them to commit those acts in the first place - *and rewarded them for it* shares the blame.
Always use affect as a verb and use effect as a noun. I remember because affect starts with a, action starts with a, verbs are actions 

The person you replied to should have said effect. 

Effect can be used a verb but literally never ever use it that way cause it’s a headache and people will just “correct” you anyway
It was, right up until some time in the 60s when some assholes got elected and told the CIA to go to town
But stable, democratic nations can develop a desire to get a fair deal for their resources and labour, where brutal dictatorships can be relied on to keep serving US corporate interests by just supplying an adequate bribe and some professional death squad training in the US - much more profitable. The deaths of a few thousands of people every year are just a “cost of doing business” to those corporations.
More like “Oh boy I gotta keep my portfolio growing” that funds this shit
I don’t eat garbage, I compost it.
Few things.

* Meat comes from animals. This involves killing animals. One cannot eat meat from a living animal.
* Most meat in the Western world comes from a "corporate" producer. Meat is a high investment product with low profits. For any meaningful production at the scale demanded by the Western World, this would require massive investment, logistics, and planning. We can't all eat at Uncle Welfare's Cruelty-Free Farm^(TM).
* Animals in captivity must be bred to produce offspring. This is usually done through [artificial insemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination#In_animals) to introduce better genetics. Artificial insemination involves rectal palpation and forcibly inserting a pipette full of thawed semen into the uterus. Even small time producers do this. The practice is ubiquitous in animal agriculture.
* Animal production is never done humanely. [Piglets](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/literature-reviews/welfare-implications-teeth-clipping-tail-docking-and-permanent-identification-piglets) are castrated and tail docked without anesthetic, [dairy calves](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150428081801.htm) are psychologically traumatized through separation from their mothers within 24 hours of life, and [male layer chicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) are thrown living into meat grinders, to name a few examples. Every producer does these things, no matter how "corporate" their operation is. Virtually all animal producers support laws which restrict undercover journalism on their farms. Go on YT and search some videos, if you have the stomach for it. 
* [Plant-based diets are far more sustainable than Western omnivorous diets.](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/476S/4576675) If you are concerned about the environmental impacts of meat production, then you should consider not eating meat.
How do you ethically take the life of someone who *wants to continue living*?
Unfortunately, small farms aren't going to be able to efficiently feed billions.
Small scale animal mutilation facilities still massacre animals.
Fair. I doubt CVS or any other pharmacy retailers constitute a significant portion of their sales though. They'd have to lose grocery stores to feel any real impact.
I suppose they’re referring to animals that are well taken care of (not kept in cramped cages) and killed swiftly so they don’t feel pain. That’s what I’d guess.
If you domt kill that cow yourself you're a hypocrite. Especially if you dont even witness it.
Other than buying up farms for ten cents on the dollar and creating giant commercial farms that pollute ten times as much as others, while also taking advantage of carbon pricing loopholes, I can’t see JBS Canada doing much more than that. Canada has crazy restrictions on how foods are imported, exported, quality standards, etc.

There’s a dairy cartel up here that basically decides our elections. I’m not exaggerating.
We love Argentinian beef even more.
0% import. Australian operations are 4% of JBS global. 90% of JBS Australia is exported to Asia. They do compete agains JBS USA and Brazil for market share. Back to the issue, I assume these beef companies buy cattle on the open market like they do in Australia? Therefore do not always know which lot comes from which farm (even farms or companies have different trading names).
Right, that makes more sense.
Rich people don't defund schools, politicians do.  You know...the ones that the ignorant masses continuously elect?

But they should be able to live as comfortable as you without working as hard as you. The strong have to suffer for everyone else or something like that...
I think it’s just that people in general suck. Like if I were rich, I would probably turn into the thing we hate most
Maybe rely on unbiased sources that don’t have a financial interest in animal agriculture? And the fact is, you ***are*** cherry picking. Besides, how much meat eaten in the US is brought in from Brazil? A lot, meaning it doesn’t matter what you say about American animal agriculture, a large portion of the beef that is eaten here is directly responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon.
You are only using research funded by the agriculture industry, that you also work in. That is misleading. The USDA is not an unbiased source either as it relies on profits from animal agriculture and lobby groups who block any alternative view. Have you not heard of the McGovern report in 1977? The industries you work in actively pursue profit over the welfare of anything else.   It's likely that your sources are biased towards?

And if you want a short film from just before the youtube era directed by a then emerging talent: Alejandro González Iñárritu then there's this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blb4QJe0siI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blb4QJe0siI) 

I've heard that Iñárritu described the opening scene as illustrating the typical tension a photographer might see on harvest day/payday when farm hands with machetes as their harvest tools and the armed security that oversees them and settles any disputes over fair pay. There's other interpretations out there but that's the one I heard back in the day when there was no youtube and BMW was producing films about difficult social justice issues.

There were some churches that ran a kind of underground railroad for Salvadorans. I happened to be dating the daughter of a pastor who was involved or I'd never have known.

All that was already well known and widely discussed in the American mainstream media. Films, magazine and newspaper articles, documentaries, punk rock songs, novels, etc.

>   Only solution I can see is an immortal, benevolent AI dictatorship. 

But who gets to program the AI that serves as the dictatorship?

It's a cute idea in theory, but what happens when people get tired of being ruled by a computer?  Who gets to decide who gets to design and implement the AI?  How would the AI react to a mass uprising against it's rule if it suddenly stops being benevolent?

By definition, computers are logic based systems.  Humans don't react well to logic past a certain point, we are easily swayed by emotions.  That's why we dump massive amounts of medical and financial resources sustaining ninety year olds with dementia, diabetes, and congestive heart failure.  It would make more sense to simply put them all to sleep and invest resources on people who are actively contributing to society.  But nobody wants to give gam-gam the Ol' Yeller treatment.
i was thinking benevolent aliens being our only hope.
Anarchism doesn't favor ruthlessness. Direct democracy and socialism eliminate the incentive to be cruel.
Capitalism wouldn’t inherently prevent people from collecting rain water or desalinating ocean water. Profits incentivize the creation of innovative techniques to source and sell clean water better than others at cheaper cost
You're right it would make more sense to say it's why the idea of a totally unregulated/completely free market  will never work.
Venezuela's hyperinflation was caused by currency controls put in place by Maduro. This isn't a US problem or a Socialism problem, but rather that Venezuela has incompetent leadership. Maduro is shit at governance.
> the situation that was caused by crashing oil prices resulting in hyperinflation.

yea, let's ignore the fact that socialist imposed price controls caused the abandonment of domestic production of everything but oil and forced the country to heavily rely on selling said oil in order to afford their import dependency. 

>Btw, Venezuela under chavez was never repressive. In fact, his programs greatly help the poor.

Sure, when you're incapable of looking at an issue past the superficial you will notice there's a problem when the evil bourgeois tries to sell bread for 2 bolivars when it only cost him 1 bolivar to produce it. So indeed, forcing the evil capitalist to sell the bread for 0.9 bolivars would help the poor cause now they could afford more bread. Until no one made bread any longer and the poor ended up wishing there was bread to be bought and willing to pay 100 bolivars for it but there's none and now they're starving and the money is worthless piled up in the streets cause there's nothing you can spend it on because "US bad".....
>	we don’t soo this shit in northern europe, the birthplace of modern capitalism.

Ah, I see, we are brush the fact that those economies were built by exploiting colonised countries under the rug.
Capitalism as we know it today is the best way of managing and distributing resources for utilitarian purposes - it has evolved from natural ways of trading, speculating, innovating and producing goods and services for thousands of years. The framework is part of the problem but humans represent the lions share; put us in a system and we'll bend it to our will. There was greed and killing in the name of profit or power before capitalism.
Capitalism is predatory.  It forcibly rewards the wealthy with the product of workers, and brutalizes underclasses to compete for the artificially limited spoils.
What system is there where people are not rewarded for being horrible to each other? Because literally every economic or governance system has had similar issues.
It didn't start in the 60s. You could look at the [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company#Banana_massacre) Wikipedia page, or go through [General Smedley Butler's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company#Banana_massacre). We've been at this all century.
On top of that, the meat industry is heavily subsidized,  so our tax money goes into it regardless of whether or not we support it..
Thank you for this
I don't see why things can't be localized, and done right.
Everyone acts like it's either go completely vegan, or pay evil corporations out of state to bring you your food. It's a false dichotomy. 

I want to see more "let's fix the standards of farming animals, until there is not an ounce of suffering".
Studies have shown that it is prohibitively difficult to eat the animals while they are still alive.
Fantasies. Since when was bleeding to death after being cut open or bolted in the head 4 times a way you'd want to go?
Politicians are rich people...
Due to propaganda shoved down their throat by the rich.
Uh huh. Politicians are enslaved to wealth. Paid speaking engagements, no-work consultancy jobs, no-work executive positions for sons and daughters, massive investments in businesses. Politicians do what the rich people instruct them to do, and they don’t do anything the rich people do not approve of.
Rich people can and have completely circumvented elections by donating to the winner directly.
And who bribes the politicians?

Wow, yeah, guy sounds like a real piece of shit. I had no idea how much influence he had on the world.
I have a feeling that his reason for turning down Nixon wasn’t a moral thing, but a lack of him benefiting from the deal.
Yep. The people the US gave special forces like training to take out the cartel did decapitate the leadership. Then decided it made more sense ($) for them to just run it themselves rather than take the whole thing down. They greatly escalated the violence and torture because they were very well trained psychopaths.

It's always amazing to me that Republicans say things like this, when they're so proud of themselves for stopping America from having even a reasonable foundation of welfare. 

Guess what, GOP? Nobody's coming to America for the universal healthcare, the livable minimum wage, or the affordable housing.

>Western countries don't like to document their own atrocities.

I think this is every country. Western countries, eastern countries, southern countries...

Japan doesn't acknowledge Unit 731. China doesn't acknowledge anything they've done. Saudi Arabia, Israel, India, Russia are all the same. Personally, I don't like to admit to most of my mistakes either.
Or The Philippines. Just as atrocious. When soldiers write home that they spent the month killing unarmed people in the hills and villages because those were the orders, that's fucked.
I was amazed when I had to explain what a Banana Republic was to my group of coworkers, ranged 23-30, all highly educated and emotionally intelligent people.
I am so tired of hearing that line. In public high school in the early 2000s I absolutely learned about horrible shit we did in South America, the Philippines, native Americans, war crimes in Vietnam etc.
>NO ONE learns in school about what they did in South America


We did... HoA baby
>Western countries don't like to document their own atrocities.

Germany does. And they own up to it.
America still talks about their past more than Europe.
Well, that is patently false. I went to a public school in California, and I learned about how awful we were to South America.
At least in Australia we fully document and teach about all the atrocities committed against the Aboriginal people.
We shared turkey and mashed potatoes...
Look up what happened to blacks im Philadelphia. We bombed our own black community because it was successful
I definitely learned about both.  We spent a lot of time going over the fucked up shit in south america, even hosted a general from school of america's to discuss everything.  Granted, I went to a jesuit hs and US trained killers slaughtered jesuit priests in south america.  

Crazy thing was, even after learning about all of the atrocities, and the general basically saying "whelp, that's the price of doing business" about 1/2 the school still supported the US side and thought it was all just necessary evils of being a super power.
I agree.
Yeah, those guys are real jerks.

I'd probably visit Marx and explain to him how technology develops over the next couple centuries and warn about people trying to force his theoretical outcomes before capitalism gets them there.
Yet when water companies are able to lobby for their invested interests that's no longer the case. There are 4 states in the US where collecting rainwater is illegal
But the Ancaps tell me unregulated capitalism works perfectly fine.
Maduro is shit and incompetent but this is most certainly a US problem. Did you watch the video? The US caused the conditions for hyperinflation.
And if this wasn’t obvious - the greed and killing will continue even if you eradicate capitalism.
>There was greed and killing in the name of profit or power before capitalism.

The profit motive is part and parcel of capitalism. Capitalism harnesses greed via the profit motive like no other system. The results are massive inequality and injustice. The fact that you state that capitalism

>is the best way of managing and distributing resources for utilitarian purposes

is laughable. Capitalism excels at **inequality** and **inequity**. The most equitable times in America have been the times when capitalism is most curtailed.
Best? It's just hard to imagine that we couldn't make major adjustments to make it *better*... Imagine any system that's ever been used and someone's contemporary said it was the best. Well, maybe the most successful so far in some ways... But the best? So nothing ever could be made better? That's just a hard argument to make.

And capitalism was born out of Feudalism. Likewise, its defenders referred to it kindly and imagined nothing better.

But the framework of those who produce the wealth (the workers) not actually owning the means of production... That's caused the vast vast vast majority of all of these complained about problems, from local things like outsourcing to exploitation of cheap labor to dumping chemicals and waste in areas where [the customers and workers] live.

Calling it the best is a tall order with neoliberalism showing its seams and infinite growth looking unlikely in the near future...
Yeah, capitalism is the best way of managing and distributing resources - that's why despite spending more money per person on healthcare than other developed countries, the US has some of the worst public health outcomes out of any first world country.

Very efficient.
It's not a utilitarian form of distribution unless you think profit is utilitarian. We know where medicine needs to go, we could direct that medicine however we need to like many of the countries of the world, but instead we have a convoluted medical system where medicine costs many time here than across the border.
Indeed. Of [$38 billion USD spent on agricultural subsidies annually, roughly 63% ($23.94 Billion USD) of that goes to dairy and meat](https://medium.com/@laletur/should-governments-subsidy-the-meat-and-dairy-industries-6ce59e68d26). If the US population is 330 million, that's about $72.55 per capita going toward meat subsidies!
Do you consider the killing of a sentient being at a young age to be suffering? Because if you do then it's not a false dichotomy. Meat requires animals be killed, whether that's on a factory farm or Imaginary Local Farm^TM.
Can confirm. Just tried to eat my dog and he barked at me
Lmao

First of all the guy running the bolt rarely misses. 

Second of all if this is one of those factory slaughterhouse deals he isn’t going to have time for a second shot because the animal still gets knocked out and falls over and starts bleeding out and getting processed. They aren’t stopping production and hitting anything 4 times, sorry. 

Chicken factories are the worst though. 100 people all standing in line making the same slice on a chicken assembly line. 

So what we should really be calling for is a farming revolution and a removal from corporations from our food system but we both know that’s a pipe dream and since that won’t happen the earth is going to be fucked.
It's a vicious circle so let's hope it can break one day.
That's more or less what I was going to say too. We tend to be a net exporter of beef in the U.S. That link pulls directly from the USDA and ERS, so I'd think anyone should have trouble trying to at least claim the charts are biased somehow at about 4.5% of imports from Brazil. People should also remember that not all of Brazil is rainforest. As you go south in the country, you actually do have land that is suited for grazing. That is definitely not the case in the north where the rainforest is being destroyed.
Look up the Behind the Bastards podcast episode on him of you are really interested. It's quite something.
Absolutely true. Thank you for the addendum
The same way the wealthy have always claimed that the masses rising up violently had nothing to do with their horrific abuse.
It's a catch-22. If you're a refugee seeking asylum, you automatically become a criminal, at which point you're a criminal seeking welfare. It's a self fulfilling truth!

Never heard of this before. What war was this and what years did this occur?
May I ask what it is? I’ve heard the phrase, but I couldn’t tell you what it actually means. 

Might be a few people on here like me who don’t know what it means either.

Edit: thank you to everyone for sending me all the helpful links! This is way more fucked up than I initially bargained for and I’m amazed at how little I knew about this prior to now.
I mean, we allowed it to become the name of a clothing brand. Do you think that would actually happen if even a small fraction of people knew what a Banana Republic was? 

Their Wikipedia page doesn't even have a Controversies section because literally no one cared.
Suntan lotion ?
Europe moved on, but we do learn of the past and are aware of it.
Lol haven’t you only got like 100 years of it
That is good, but keep in mind each state, and to a lesser extent district, sets their own curriculum. Many are likely to have NOT learned about that sort of stuff.
Whoa man calm down
I’m aware and think it’s ridiculous. That’s not capitalism, it’s welfare for corporations
No, the US just put the nail in the coffin. The Venezuelan economy was collapsing well before those sanctions. Inflation doubled every year in Venezuela starting in 2012 to 2013. The oil sanctions were in 2017. In 2012 the inflation rate was 21%. In 2016, the year before US Sanctions, the inflation rate was 264%. In 2017, the year of the sanctions (which occurred in August) the inflation rate was over 800%. 

You can definitely say that the US made stuff worse, but to blame it on the US is disingenuous. Maduro set his country on fire by his own idiocy, the US just poured gasoline on it. The US didn't even need to, that shit was burning plenty well without our help.
You said the guy rarely misses. So they do miss sometimes and an animal dies in pain. Even one miss is too many.
I could never work in one of those places. Has to take a psychological toll on people, surely?
I’m still upset about that
Pieces of shit, the whole lot of ‘em.
Are you kidding? They still deny comfort women were forced into it. Many high ranking individuals still deny any harm was done.
The Philippine-American War was by official US accounts 1899-1902, though the US had been there since the rebellion in 1896 and had been fighting Spain, who held The Philippines before that particular war, even longer than that.

Horrible things occurred.

Edit: I'm at work and a touch hazy on details, but look it up if you're interested - don't take my word for it. Pretty well documented as the US media had a heyday on the government once those letters recounting the various actions taken by soldiers began to arrive in the states.
It all stems from what we did to get bananas from South America and protect US company interests.

"In 1901, the American author [O. Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry) coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under [economic exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources) by U.S. corporations, such as the [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic#cite_note-1) "

" One of the most notorious strikes by United Fruit workers broke out on 12 November 1928 near [Santa Marta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Marta) on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. On December 6, [Colombian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_Army) troops allegedly under the command of [General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General) [Cortés Vargas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cort%C3%A9s_Vargas), opened fire on a crowd of strikers in the central square of [Ciénaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci%C3%A9naga,_Magdalena). Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 47 to 3000.\[[*clarification needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)\]  The military justified this action by claiming that the strike was  subversive and its organizers were Communist revolutionaries.  Congressman [Jorge Eliécer Gaitán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Eli%C3%A9cer_Gait%C3%A1n) claimed that the army had acted under instructions from the United Fruit Company."

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_Fruit\_Company#Banana\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company#Banana_massacre)

&#x200B;

American fruit companies overthrew democratically elected governments throughout South America, funded militias, and had their hands in the murder of thousands and the oppression of millions. Cause we needed bananas.
In the late 1800s to mid 1900s, American businesses and their mercenary armies effectively controlled central American companies and geared all national efforts towards exporting bananas specifically and fruit in general. 

If the countries tried to do anything, the US Marine Corps would intervene.
A country whose economy is dependent on exporting via a single monopoly in that country, which basically means that company controls that country.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic
straight from wikipedia for ya:

>In [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science), the term **banana republic** describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, such as [bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana) or minerals. In 1901, the American author [O. Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry) coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under [economic exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources) by U.S. corporations, such as the [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic#cite_note-1) Typically, a banana republic has a society of extremely [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification) [social classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class), usually a large impoverished [working class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class) and a ruling-class [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy), composed of the business, political, and military elites of that society.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic#cite_note-2) The ruling-class controls the [primary sector of the economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy) by way of the [exploitation of labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour);[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic#cite_note-GREED-3) thus, the term *banana republic* is a pejorative descriptor for a servile dictatorship that abets and supports, for [kickbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption#Kickbacks), the exploitation of large-scale [plantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation) agriculture, especially banana cultivation.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic#cite_note-GREED-3)

US corporations kinda fucked a few countries and now there is a clothing company named after it.

edit: confused quotations between slack and reddit. this isn't slack haha
Here ya go.  
  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic
To be fair, I knew what a banana republic was in 1983 and was aware of our involvement in in Latin America up to that point. What was I, as a 13 year old, meant to do about it?
Never learned it. Lived in several
states. Also never covered the Vietnam war.
Sorry, got a little carried away there.
Which corporations are able to make into law because of the wealth they collect through the capitalist system.
It's not possible to seperate those two things. The latter is a direct and inevitable consequence of the former. 

Sure you can make temporary reforms sometimes, but even then the power of capital always erodes them in pretty short order.

Capitalism means that capital = power, and power means influence. It's simply not possible to have groups of people with that much economic power and influence without them having massive power and influence over politics, directly or indirectly. 

Sure it would be nice if you could, but it's pure fantasy, sounds good in theory, doesn't work in reality. It's like when people talk about "crony capitalism", as if any other sort of capitalism has ever existed.

Now you could still say that you think capitalism is worth it regardless of flaws like that, but you certainly can't just deny its flaws.
I don't disagree with this.

My point was that the US is exploiting the crisis for their own ends and made the crisis orders of magnitude worse.
Oh yes, quite a bit. You can read a ton of papers and such about the subject. 

Chicken factories are the worst because the volume and also people just stand there and make one cut over and over for like 4 hours until they get a smoke and lunch then it’s another 4 hours.
So glad we’ve scheduled their planet to be demolished to make way for the new hyperspace bypass.
Thank you very much! I will check this out and learn my stuff. 👍🏻
"In March 2007 Chiquita Brands pleaded guilty in a United States Federal court to aiding and abetting a terrorist organization...In addition to monetary payments, Chiquita has also been accused of smuggling weapons (3,000 AK-47's) to the AUC and in assisting the AUC in smuggling drugs to Europe."

Wth? You'd think they'd lay low after everything that had happened before.
Never really thought about it before but how f'ing bizarre that that became the name of a slightly upscale clothing brand… Like of all things to name the company, they choose THAT ? I know that originally the company was not upscale and actually had a safari-inspired theme, but still for that to develop into what they are now and then keep the name, it's just SO weird.
Highly recommend ["The Century of the Self"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFwDc17WZ-A) by Adam Curtis.

That link is all 4 episodes and just shy of 4 hours long so I don't expect everyone to watch it, but the first episode (1hr) talks about the United Fruit Company.
They did the same thing to workers here. We just happen to come out on top. Look up the Battle of Blair Mountain. Oddly... they don't teach that in schools...
We still basically do that, but we use the CIA
No, you directly said that the US was the cause of the crisis.
Need me to sign off on that?
I want to upvote this bc you're bringing attention to it, but downvote it because you're surprised it's still happening.
And really fucking insensitive. It'd be like naming your company the Trail of Tears.
They don't teach ***a lot*** in schools anymore. Especially of this nature where the government/big corporations looks shady.
The hyperinflation crisis, yes. The cause of the worst part of the crisis, yes. As my linked video shows.

Farmers and ranchers have had a real shit year. 
Fortunately this is mostly in ground beef because the ecoli gets mixed in. Cuts of beef are safer because they would only have the bacteria on the surface which would be killed once the surfaces are cooked to a high enough temperature.

Chicken is different, I learned, because salmonella is in the body of the chicken, so chicken must be fully cooked all the way through.
So about 100 cows? 
and then farms shutting down on top of this
Holy shit, am I glad I got stew meat earlier today instead.
This is why europe doesn't want your food America.
You forgot death. Mostly in the really young  and elderly. If you’re young and healthy you don’t have to worry as much but, should still be a concern. 
So I must have DOMS from the gym, a cold, and E. Coli from my protein. What luck I have...
Well. Fuck.
But the workers had bigger shits on your lettuce.
glorious pun
Thanks trump for easing those pesky FDA regulations. 
Ground beef should be cooked all the way through anyways.
Went to Norway and ordered a burger abd it came back like a medium-rare steak.  I have had food poisoning before and it out me out of work for 4 days.  No thanks.  They looked at me like I was an idiot when I asked them to cook it completely done.

Do not fuck around with ground beef.
That doesn’t seem like a whole lot really, but I guess it is
A couple thousand more likely, probably one lot date for one plant.
Still not really that many head in the grand scheme of things. 
or about 1 unit of your mom.
rain on the scarecrow. blood on the combine.
[Right, this never occurs in Europe](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/emergencies/international-health-regulations/outbreaks-of-e.-coli-o104h4-infection)  

Would guess you read more about these outbreaks in the US v. Europe in that we consume more ground beef.  Thus the E.Coli on the surface of the beef is mixed together, and does not remain on the surface.  

If you have the means, would recommend getting your beef ground from a single animal.
What, you're happier to just deal with mad cow disease?
We don't want your food either, you know with the mad cow disease you guys have over there.
[deleted]
I think death can be inferred from dehydration and bloody diarrhea.

"Oh hey Bob, heard you had a nasty cold"

"Yeah, it gave me bloody diarrhea, but with a little bed rest I was fine"

this has strain O5:157 written all over it, mainy because this strain has acquired the shiga toxin.
and gyno...don't forget the gyno
It's not funny and also not true.
I agree, but there are so, SO many people who treat it similarly to steak
I think we can agree. I'm a well done kinda guy.
The poop should be cooked all the way through anyways.
Until you take 100 from 30,000,000(cows killed each year for food in the US) then you're back to a rounding error.
Why would you boil ground beef?
You're just being utopianly unrealistic. The commode, if there is one available can be up to 1/4 mile away, which is quite a trek during a hot summer day. Leaving the post is frowned upon, and if you leave your post you can get docked, or even get a checkmark which will lead to your replacement.

It's kinda funny.


Uh oh
*GROUND BEEF*? What the... What numbnuts leave their ground beef pink for eating? That's fucked 
It's the only proper way.
To see if it floats
I always put a bit of water in with my ground beef. I’m not really sure why. 
Because you want White Castle-style "burgers."
Go order a burger at a halfway decent restaurant. They'll ask you how you want your ground beef prepared almost every time. Even a shithole like Applebee's will ask "pink, or no pink?" 

&#x200B;

I tried to enjoy medium well, fuck even medium burgers, and I hated the texture in the middle. Last time I went out for some, I ordered for myself and a friend, and I had them both well-done. He was legitimately upset and started condescending to me about how much flavor and "juice" his meal lost. 

&#x200B;

So to answer your question about "what numbnuts", it's an unsightly number of both regular joes and managers/cooks in the industry. 
People who like juicy burgers, that's who.  So, probably the majority of meat eaters.
It’s fine when you’re in the EU with decent regulations. 
The beef is a witch?
I thought those were steamed. 
Every time a server has asked me pink or no pink, the first time I thought they were getting fresh, but after that I tell them to make sure it's actually cooked and it's a stupid question whether they have to ask that or not.
A properly prepared well done burger is juicier than one with pink in the middle. “Juice” is rendered fat, the fat on rare meat doesn’t render. 
You can have a fully cooked burger and have it be juicy and not pink, unless you're one of those burger squeezers who don't know how to treat meat.
Or in the US where you just give it a little ammonia. 
Is the witch a duck?
Who are you sir knight that you are so wise in the way of the shits?
I really try to avoid factory farm meat but it is expensive. I cut out chicken and eggs by raising my own, but local meat is nearly twice the price.
Is filming factory farms still legally considered terrorism?
And people ask me why I don't eat pork... Smh
I guess that's how the dinosaurs died. They thought killing to eat was to cruel. So they starved. 
Grab SKS, go innawoods, eat deer. 
Same. I’ll all for true pasture raised meat, but the only way to get a good deal is to buy a whole cow/pig at a time.

And even then its at least 2x store prices.
Well there's a few possible reasons: allergies, religion, opinions, flavour, fat contents, etc.
It's not so much the killing, but the tortuous conditions for a lifetime leading up to it. 
Funny not excuse. Most dinosaurs were herbivores 
You could just stop eating meat.
You could just go throw yourself into a lava pit.
It would be better for the planet in the long run, you got me there 
The planet doesn't give a shit whether it's a hospitable environment for living things, or a swirling mass of boiling gases, rocks and metals. WE, on the other hand ...
Eating just plants is not healthy for a human. We need meat. 
Well of course. I also eat fruits and grains/legumes and some dairy. You don’t think vegetarians eat just plants, do you? 
Dairy isn’t vegetarian. And fruits/nuts are considered plants.
Dairy isn’t vegan, but it’s definitely vegetarian— read the Wikipedia page if you doubt it.


What do they do with all that meat?  Can't they kill all the bacteria with radiation or UV light and feed it to animals or something?
At first I was like "goddamn french don't they have anything better to do than outlaw religious statues in public places", assuming it was some 700 year old eroding statue in the middle of the town square.

Then I saw it was only 5 years old and was like "actually yeah fuck it". Sometimes I wish we had a similar thing here in the US. I live in the south. There's a town near where I live that features a 30ft tall wooden cross right off the main highway exit. Not an unusual sight here in the south but the thing that makes it 'special' is the red paint dripped all over it and the words "IT IS FINISHED" also painted in creepy red letters on the crossbeam. 

Christianity is so weird...
Seems fair.  They want to ban burkinis and Islam, might as well go all the way.

Of course, I am agnostic and think all religions are kind of silly.
Well I mean, they kind of have to for fairness' sake
Maybe they should demolish Notre Dame de Paris just to be in compliance.

True Christians who follow Christ's teachings don't need to venerate idols, icons, flags, etc.

2 Cor. 5:7, NAB: “We walk by faith, not by sight.”

Isa. 40:18, JB: “To whom could you liken God? What image could you contrive of him?”

Acts 17:29, JB: “Since we are the children of God, we have no excuse for thinking that the deity looks like anything in gold, silver or stone that has been carved and designed by a man.”

Isa. 42:8, JB: “My name is Yahweh, I will not yield my glory to another, nor my honour to idols [“graven things,” Dy].”

[deleted]
Yup, thats how it works. When you start to try and reason that other goofy gods are bad and that your goofy god is cool... well, then you become what supposedly hate.
So we can pull down the eiffel tower being a religious symbol?
It's a statue. Sure if the true "believers" are such, they won't be too upset 
~~Christianity~~ People are so weird...

FTFY
Honestly this is the only way I'll respect the burkini ban, if they ban everything religious.  Otherwise you're dealing with targeted persecution.
Are you sure?
You're certainly not agnostic about religion.
>all religions are kind of silly

Quite the understatement.
Is it a public space(owned by the French government)?
You make an interesting point but take it too far. Why should one of the most important aspects of life, the work/rest balance be kept on a solely religious basis? It should be based on improvements for productivity after research on it.
Agreed.  But...

Matthew 22:39, NIV: "and the second [greatest commandment] is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself."

Let's not pretend that Christians truly, consistently follow the Bible.  Banning symbols of a specific culture (like the burkini) isn't in line with that teaching.
If Jesus was electrocuted would the Christian symbol be a chair?
>But seriously people? Does a statue of a major historical figure offend you that much?

Governments should not be spending tax money to advance the interests of religions.
...is it?
What? Its not religious at all.  It was built for the universal expo in 1870 which occurred on French independence day.
Yeah but the ones who think the universe is ruled by a bearded white dude who says you go to hell for eternity if you jack off are *especially* weird.
Just because I don't know if there is a higher power doesn't mean I can't find the current religions silly.
>consistently follow the Bible 

As if that's even possible...  As for love -- what's love got to do with it?

Luke 14:26 If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple.

Now, if you hate your own life and family, then to love your neighbor as yourself essentially means that you must hate their life and family too.

Matthew 10:34-35  Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn 'A man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.'

Also, you neglect Matthew 22:37 Jesus declared, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’

This is related to the Ten Commandments Exodus 34:13-14 You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their sacred poles (for you shall worship no other god, because the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).

In case there is any doubt Exodus 34:28  ... And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
If he had been hanged it would be a noose.
I don't think you call someone who hasn't even been proven to be an actual real person a historical figure
[deleted]
They are not, they are getting upset over a statue that is already there?
I'd prefer it to be the [Head-Ripping-Off Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfsMMVgIToA).
The person exists only as a religious figure. Saying it is historical and not religious is like saying the ten commandments are just good advice and arnt trying to convert anyone.
The article says the statue was built using municipal funds (local taxes) in 2011.

That shouldn't have happened in the first place.
Those are writings encouraging people to act in a certain way. 

This is a statue of a historically important person. A person who is important to more than one religion.
The person has no historical significance outside of religion. Claiming it isnt a religious statue is just dishonest.
Just because she is a religious figure that doesn't mean she isn't also a major historical one as well.
She could be. But she isnt. 
What did she do that doesn't have anything to do with jesus?
For the non-military a 2 star General getting relieved  is a super big thing. It's about as pain full for the service as a VP at a Fortune 500 getting removed for what may be misconduct. 

Depending on what comes from this he could also be looking at a couple thousand dollars a month in lost retirement pay. 
cant stand stripes.com
I quit out after the second pop up 
Some dick comments in here early. Can't wait to see the pom-pom girl they replace him with
Is it just me, or does he look a lot like Woody Harrelson?

Also, if anyone has any info on why it is the pentagon lost confidence in him, please send it my way. Very curious.
A far-right religious fanatic made it all the way to Infantry Division Commander.  Guys like this are the kind of people who would participate in a right-wing coup against the U.S. government.  I'll bet this guy also supports Trump, probably a good thing he was removed from command before Trump's defeat. 
Doesn't being a "conservative christian" immediately call into question a person's intelligence?  I don't want some deluded moron making life or death decisions with "medieval magical thinking" in the mix.
I presume the "lack of confidence" here is in higher ups confidence in him?
> It's about as pain full for the service as a VP at a Fortune 500 getting removed for what may be misconduct.

Not entirely. A VP at a Fortune 500 company removed for misconduct can get a position at another company and move up still. 

One a General (1 through 4 stars) gets relieved of command, his career is over in the military. He'll never get promoted or a major command again.
> *Can't wait to see the pom-pom girl they replace him with[.]*

E-1 or never been in?

This guy is a ***ᴄᴏᴍʙᴀᴛ ᴀʀᴍs*** - Infantry Division Commander - General Officer, not some Finance or Maintenance Depot guy.

The Army doesn't put 'pom-pom girls' in that kind of position.

The people the Army tends to put in charge of a Division almost always have actual combat experience, and most often are medaled for some sort of valor under fire while at a lower pay grade.

That said:

> *FORT RILEY, Kan. — The 1st Infantry Division’s new commanding general is under intense scrutiny this week after missing the division review in his honor, sources report. Maj. Gen. Wayne W. Grigsby Jr. reportedly told his commander he was “really, really ill” and at sick call, sources say.*

> *Grigsby, who replaced Maj. Gen. Paul Funk III this past Thursday at the top position in the Army’s oldest serving infantry division, was seen by numerous witnesses limping to sick call after half-heartedly grabbing his leg and yelling “My hammy!” in the first 100 meters of a 10k division change of command run earlier that morning.*

> *After nearly three hours, a senior NCO found him at the aid station with his head tilted back, mouth agape, snoring while all 4,000 soldiers under his command were standing at parade rest on the blazing hot Custer Parade Field.*

> *“Any time I see a piece of shit racked out at sick call I come up behind them, violently shake them awake, and ask them who their commander is,” said the division’s Sustainment Brigade Command Sgt. Maj. Stephen Harris,* ***who stops by sick call seven days a week to berate and shame soldiers for malingering.*** *“When he said [III Corps Commander] Lt. Gen. McFarland I thought it was some turd-lifer Specialist fucking with me.”*
 
> *“Turns out it was not.”*

> *After speaking with several soldiers who served with Grigsby at previous commands, it seems that this is not the first time he has “missed” parades with last-minute injuries.*

> *“When [Grigsby] was getting ready to leave Djibouti,* ***he was purportedly attacked by a congress of Hamadryas baboons*** *and unable to attend his change of command,” says an unnamed source, who served with Grigsby at multiple duty stations. “And back when he was Aide-de-Camp to the Commander of XVIII Airborne Corps he always seemed to ‘burn-in’ on a jump right before the ‘All-American Week’ parade.”*

What are you talking about? The General in question here is being releived for a completely different reason than attending a prayer breakfast. Not to mention that a "far-right coup" is about as realistic in the US as the spirit of Lincoln coming back and inhabiting his image on Mt Rushmore. Mate, you need to get out and meet people.
Invest in tinfoil!
Yoi cross the line and start using g your military position to support other religious nuts when the military made it clear they crossed the line, you deserve the boot.
It could have been either way. Realistically, though, it probably came from above him.

It takes some *serious* clout to get get a general officer forcibly relieved of duty. 
For those of you who may have missed it about [the Duffelblog:](http://www.duffelblog.com/about/)

>We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization.
Can we all agree that would be dope as hell though
> *Not to mention that a "far-right coup" is about as realistic...*

I suggest you spend some time on Wikipedia perusing something called "The Business Plot" of the 1930s, where certain business leaders approached TWO-time Medal of Honor winner Marine General Smedly Butler claiming that they had 500,000 out-of-work WWI veterans willing to march on Washington to overthrow the US Government and wanted Butler to lead them in that effort.

While you're at it, look up Prescott Bush, US Senator, and father and grandfather to George and George, who was involved in that plot and was subsequently indicted (but not convicted) for doing business with the Nazis ***ᴅᴜʀɪɴɢ*** WWII through his bank in New York.

Also look up the John Birch Society, which oddly enough, began its rise to popularity about the time of the Business Plot.

The JBS is about as Far-Right as it is possible to get, and in the '60s and later, ANY association with the JBS would get you denied a security clearance. (Source: I conducted background investigations for very high-level security clearances in that time period.)

While you're on the JBS Wiki page, note it's principles and then mosey over to the Republican National Committee's website and read the Republican Party Platform. Compare the two.

Fascism is about the marriage of government and business, with a strong dose of Nationalism to keep the serfs in line. Think about that while you also mull the word 'privatize'.

If there ever is another attempt at a coup in the US, it WILL come from the Right, and 'small government' will become the word of the day, because a 'small' government is also a 'toothless' government - except for military. Big military is GOOD. Big military keeps EVERYbody in line.

And with all media in the US owned by just six companies (thanks to the Telecommunications Act in the early '90s, which was touted as 'fostering competition', but resulted in the consolidation of some 4,000 radio and TV stations into a mere handful of companies within a matter of MONTHS), there will BE no more pesky 'investigations' by newspaper and broadcast interests that resulted in the formation of agencies like the EPA, OSHA and others of that ilk.

It takes some *serious* fucking up on a General Officer's part to GET relieved of duty.


Smedly Butler was a bad ass, I suppose you have to be when you're named Smedly.
