$580 million to just Oklahoma, imagine what the national lawsuits could get
Which states are next in line to sue?
580 million is nowhere near the sum that the AG was seeking, but the Judge did leave open the idea that in the future Jannsen and J&J could be forced to pay more if costs to do cover the nuisance they caused. I am both surprised and disappointed. It seems like the judge made a smart call with the sum but I wish it was a lot higher.
$580M is a ridiculously paltry amount. This epidemic should bankrupt the company, or near it.
I know what opioids have done to my hometown, and I’m mad at Johnson & Johnson, but I’m really pissed at the quack doctors and their “pain clinics” that wrote all those prescriptions and the shady pharmacies that filled them. The problem started with the drug company but the doctors really helped it spread. There’s a lot of blame to go around is what I’m saying.
I am going to get ripped apart for this comment but there are legitimate patients with legitimate pain needs. Surgeries and pt cannot magically fix degenerative diseases and for some people opioids are the only remaining option.

You all need to stop complaining. I'm sorry they didn't drag the CEO out of his limo and summarily execute him, but 580 million for one state isn't a slap on the wrist. This is what the system looks like when it's working. Take the win.
Unlike cigarette companies, JNJ didn't directly sell the pharmaceuticals directly. They had licensing to poppies that were low in morphine and high in other opioids which they sold to other pharma companies under the supervision of the FDA.

 This lawsuit sets an interesting precedent moving forward tbh
This will have so many mixed comments but I think certain people’s voices should be heard.

Only the state is being reimbursed or apologized to however the citizens are the ones who were corrupted by these companies.

Non-violent drug offenders will continue to be ignored and cycled through the epidemic and treated like cattle.

Not even an apology to the addicts who are suffering and who would have never been addicted if it wasent for the massive supply of these synthetic opioids.

They might not get a dime, but how about a public apology?

It’s terrible.
In other news, Johnson & Johnson announced today it would be raising prices across all of its products by approximately $572 million to support 3Q earnings.
Tell me when some one goes to jail
I am all for taking the drug companies to task. But as someone in healthcare, I walked into urgent care the other day with what I thought could possibly be a break but turned out to be a sprained ankle. Doc whispers under his breath, "you want pain meds for that?"
Me: "No I'll just take some Advil. I just wanted to make sure I didn't need a cast."

The problem is these fucking doctors who hand it out like candy! For the type of injury I had, Advil is the course...not fucking opiates.
If you paid attention to the this three ring circus and are as confused as I am about why this kangaroo court was allowed to happen, write your reps. 

The makers of suboxone https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/indivior-inc-indicted-fraudulently-marketing-prescription-opioid were doing and continue to do an order of magnitude worse than what J&J were accused of. Indivior paid the DOJ billions of dollars to have the investigation against them stopped after they were indicted. These settlements against pharmaceutical companies have been in the hundreds of thousands to the millions. Really makes you wonder what they were afraid of, to settle in the billions. https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/indivior-s-former-parent-company-will-pay-1-4b-to-settle-federal-probe-into-suboxone

Yet here is our attention, not in Indivior but on J&J for making pain patches for patients who can’t take oral meds and have a hard time with IV access. Because of some bogus statistics drummed up by people who are on the payroll of... you guessed it, makers of suboxone. 

Guess who paid off doctors to the tune of $10,000 each to push suboxone prescriptions on their patients? Starting in the early 00’s? If you guessed the same “expert” who was paid $500,000 for his testimony, the “evidence” vs J&J, about how all non suboxone opioids are evil heroin pills, you would be correct. He also makes six figures a year (many times over) running a rehab house where they have a suboxone based program and is the “scientist” who has been putting out all those misleading statistics about prescription rooted opioid crisis while ignoring the illegal fentanyl that is actually what’s killing people. He hauls yet another six figure salary for his University research. To study the link between rx opioids and addiction. Cushy career choice!

https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/10/12/opioid-epidemic-6-charts-designed-deceive-you-11935

That’s quite the sleight of hand our corrupt government and media have going on.
Honestly I think the best solution to this problem is to hold the drug companies responsible for the rehab stays(not just one for most people seriously addicted) at high end facilities for every person who was prescribed opioids and subsequently became addicted. 

As awesome as this win is with the recent laws passed in Oklahoma all the winnings will go directly to the state, and let's be honest that means it probably won't end up in the hands of families that were directly impacted by addiction.
And here comes the appeal.
[removed]
A couple of questions for anyone who knows more about this than me:

1. Why was Oklahoma the first state?
2. What responsibility does the FDA hold for all this? They’ve approved each one of the drugs. Are there conditions to the approval (ex. Cannot be taken for more than 4 days etc). If not, then perhaps they are responsible too
I want to know why the people writing the scrpits are not the root of the problem?
I lost my father to this shit.
No money will ever be enough. 

They belong in prison.
500 million is not enough. They ruined entire generation of Americans.
Too bad the state of Oklahoma will probably just turn around and give that money to oil companies.
There's two sides to this.

 J&J marketing opiates as non-addictive and minimizing the negative effects of their drugs is unethical and they should be prosecuted for it.

On the other hand, and beyond what J&J did, opiates are sometimes necessary for pain management. I was hit by a car in my teens and had 7 surgeries within 8 months on my knee. The first few months were hell and I couldnt sleep without them due to the excruciating pain. I did become dependent on them after a while but fortunately, my doctor actually gave a shit about my mental well being and weened me off before it got bad. I think some of the doctors who were negligent in this case are getting a free pass. At the end of the day, they are the ones who prescribe the medication and believe me, sometimes it's absolutely necessary. 

The problem with opiates are the pleasant effects. They do what NSAIDs and other blood thinners can't do at the price of getting high. To some, that's a dangerous benefit. 

There's hope for the future of pain management. There are several research compounds being tested that seek to alleviate extreme pain without the pleasurable symptoms and this could ideally eliminate their addictive potential.

However, the way J&J marketed this to doctors who had no problem prescribing opiates because they could just point to the manufacturer's statements on the safety of these drugs, thus side stepping responsibility on their own part is inexcusable. Additionally, the prescribers who  liberally handed out these prescriptions despite knowing the addictive potential are equally at fault.
$500M on the BILLIONS they've made destroying lives? News of the low judgment caused a 5% RISE in the stock price. Since J&J's market cap is around $337B, that means the value of the company increased by nearly $17B today.
fuck the sackler family.
$572m... Just the cost of doing business. 
For context-->Net Earnings pulled from J&J's annual filings:

2018- 15.3 Billion
2017- 1.3 Billion (large tax charge this year)
2016- 16.5 Billion
2015- 15.4 Billion
2014- 16.3 Billion
2013- 13.8 Billion
2012- 10.5 Billion
2011- 9.7 Billion
2010- 13.3 Billion
2009- 12.3 Billion
2008- 12.9 Billion
Wait wait wait...We can *prosecute* drug dealers?! When did that happen?
I know both Johnson and Johnson got boned in this case, but I honestly think Johnson kind of fucked Johnson over. Johnson always seemed to be sort of the leader in this whole thing whereas Johnson was always sort of just following orders.
> “Janssen did not cause the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, and neither the facts nor the law support this outcome,” Johnson & Johnson general counsel Michael Ullmann said in a statement. 

Ah yes, the classic "Nu-uh" defense. Shrewd legal minds.
They supplied 60% of the materials used by opioid manufactures and pay $500M in a lawsuit seeking $17B. Seems like an extremely weak fine.
About 6000 people died in the state since 2000 due to opioid overdoses. For-profit healthcare can't die quicker.
[deleted]
Yikes, hope they don't cut Jansen Care Path, otherwise I'll want to die lmao
J&J are going to take it to a higher court
Lol but chump change will actually be paid out after appeals
Get ready for the bailouts.
Will this money go into programs to correct the situation? Or will it be brushed off that those who are now addicted must be willing to change? Or will it open up programs to help treat addictions and medical costs for all addictive related problems?
Not good enough. Call me when one of the CEO's gets a lethal injection.
Their stock went up! They were prepared to pay between 500 million  and 5 billion.  They have to be looking at this as a win.
The fact that J&J's stock went \*UP\* 2% after the judgment should be enough of a sign that the system is broken.
hell yeah...Oklahoma...doin the right shit...hey ya'll im down here in Durant and theres just pollutin people everywhere...haelp
What is this case about exactly?
Oh yeah the same company who, according to our president, are creating a "serum" to stop soldiers from committing suicide. Nothing to see here
Investors were pleased the number was so low... the stock increased.  What kind of world do we live in...
Something's really sizzling in the cooking pot.
So the AMA/doctors are going to skate?  Every pill was prescribed by a doctor.
Who ever heard of money damages for public nuisance? Why don’t they ask for injunctive relief to stop the spread of opiates? Because they don’t actually care about what they say they care about. This is a huge money grab by the gov.
What’s the probability that this gets appealed and the fines get cut down to hundreds of thousands?
**Johnson & Johnson**: People low enough to make a business model out of packaging heroin as medicine and using doctors to push it on vulnerable people.
It's good to see at least one thing going right.
What is the state of OK going to do with this cash? Spend it like drunken sailors and give more tax breaks to the rich? This does fuck all for the victims. The funds from this judgment should be strictly be used to combat the opioid crisis. Education, rehab, narcan for first responders, etc.
J&J stock actually went up about 5% when the news broke because investors thought the punishment would be more severe. Executives need to go to jail
Is this gonna be one of those things where 20000 people get to split a settlement and everyone gets like 2 bucks in the mail
They'll just pay off some politicians to get this quashed.
I don't understand why there is so much pressure on J&J considering they manufacture less than 1% of opioids in the US market, including generics...

The weird way the US has public advertising for drugs is crazy, and I know that pharma market directly to doctors too, however doctors have to stand up and take a lot of responsibility for this issue. I saw someone  post they were prescribed 200 tablets. Who the fuck needs 200 pain relief tablets at once??
This statement really jumped out at me and blew my mind: "training sales representatives to tell doctors the risk was 2.6% or less if the drugs were prescribed by a doctor" 

Why are sales reps "educating" doctors on the drug effects at all?!!
That’s it? I find that J&J can easily afford that amount of money. No jail time for anyone? So they pay a fee and can’t be tried again? 🤔
$580M deposited directly into the governments pocket for “future use” that they have the gall to say will only pay for like 6 hours of opioid education programs. Their utterly unchecked system of using the needy to get richer remains pristine. Zero going to victims
ًI am sure we all hope for a fair, race-neutral application of our nation’s wise narcotics laws.
Drug dealers go to jail, big pharmacies just pay a fine... The cost of doing business I guess?        

Money is our god.
Can someone explain why the stock went up after the ruling was read?
I know this will probably get a lot of downvotes but, why aren't doctors being held more responsible? Everyone keeps saying it was marketed heavily and with exaggerated stats - like every product ever marketed throughout time. Tf do doctors get paid so much for if they aren't even able to read labels or use common sense to know that someone getting their 100th pill for a twisted ankle isn't right? Tf do I fill out all those forms for when I go to a new doctor's office if they aren't even looking at my medical history enough to know whether I'm at risk for addiction? Why the hell do I have to jump through hoops to get a refill on my prescriptions if they aren't even checking to see if I actually need it or if I am taking them at the correct rate? Big companies put profits before patients, and always have. Doctors and pharmacists are trained professionals with a responsibility to care for patients above profits; if they aren't doing that, we need to demand they explain themselves or take them to court. If doctors aren't held responsible, we will be in the exact same situation in 20 years, except with a different drug.
"rules against"... with a slap on the wrist.

The stock is up significantly today based on such a light ruling.
Ehh, he may have found them guilty but that amount is a huge win for J&J, just look at their stock price today if you don't think so.
How about stop treating pain as an unnatural condition?
So in news feed just above this; A guy goes to prison for 11 years for an illegal pot dispensary.  Wealthy people and corporations just pay a bill, Pleebs do prison time.    


Ain't justice grand.
Instead of all the states rushing to get as much money as they can out of this, how about we start putting some CEOs and board members in jail?
...and gives them the slightest tippy tap on the wrist. Justice!!!!!
But they probably made more than $580 mill in profits from selling the opioids though?
So basically nothing more than a slap on the wrist for a multi billion dollar company.
[deleted]
Wow, the lawyers for J&J are still arguing technicalities, by disputing the legal basis Oklahoma used to sue J&J, in relying on a “public nuisance” claim. It's like we caught the arsonists red-handed and they're disputing the brand of accelerant used.

Did J&J and the other opioid painkiller manufacturers knowingly and aggressively pushed this drug? From all indications, yes. Do they hold responsibility then? Yes. Alrighty then. Round up the manufacturers who did this, tabulate how much it'll cost to fix this problem nationally, and then push the bill to the manufacturers and make *them* decide how to divvy up the liability. I'm sure at that point, since it's likely that they *all* know what each other was doing, all will be revealed and we'll get a fair settlement.
Don't fool yourself into believing this company feels the pain.  All this really means is that  J&J will pass the lawsuit setback onto the consumer. Big corporations such as this rarely lose.
And the judgement amount will likely be knocked down on appeal. Appeals courts routinely decimate (yes, reduce to 1/10th) jury judgements.
And..... appealed. 

In 2030 after the 40th appeal and Trump on his 4th term, they will have settled for $20 mil that never gets paid as somehow he "pardons" them all the while praising them on twitter for "making the best band-aids." 

The rich can't lose these days. If Epstein can get away with raping children for more than 20 years, j&j can get away with this.
These Oklahomans are the selfsame individuals who scream PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY in every situation except when it is they themselves getting high and committing crimes.

Oh, it's J&J's fault that you got yourself hooked on opioids? But it's the refugee mom's fault that she's fleeing from violence? Oh it's a corporation's fault that your son OD'd on heroin? But it's Marshawn's fault that his son OD's on crack?

FOH zero givafucks for those backward hypocrites.
Baby lotion bout to get $$$...
I read it as Johnson vs Johnson and was thinking to myself, does that mean Johnson losed and Johnson won?
They’re gonna appeal and it’s going to get thrown out. Don’t worry.
500 million dollar fine to a 337 billion dollar company for unleashing a plague upon America and lying about it. This system sucks
This shit is not gonna fly. These companies are not gonna pay out these settlements. The Regan administration is just as much at fault as Johnson & Johnson. This is like claiming that the Regan estate should pay for damages as well.
Honest question:

If we’re suing companies that produce opiates, why aren’t we suing gun companies for producing guns?
https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reports-2019-second-quarter-results

This is nothing but a show trial. $500 million. This company made $20 billion-that's with a B - in 4 months in 2019. I want you to grasp that . TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN FOUR MONTHS.
The only difference between pharmaceutical companies and the cartels are, well I guess the cartel leaders get arrested and sent to prison. How much is this fine vs what Johnson & Johnson make a year? Time and time again once you're so big, fines mean nothing. Imagine a heroin dealer getting caught and told hey, give is 1% of what you made, keep the rest, and promise don't do this again. Think that would really keep them honest?
Judge: You are at fault; pay the fine.

Investors:  Hm, let's invest in this piece of shit!

J&J:  $16.5B profit from today alone; Oh no, let's appeal! Gotta make that profit the full $17B.

Tomorrow: introducing a newly highly addictive drug for more profit on top of profit.



Wtf is wrong with people?  Talk about a fucked up opposite day
Does this mean more states can sue? Oklahoma by population is the 28th largest state with 4 million people. Imaging if a state like Florida with 21 million people sued.
Hijacking top comment....

The products at issue manufactured by JnJ (Duragesic, Nucynta & Nucynta ER) make up less than 1% of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma as well as the U.S. 

Why isn't the maker if Oxycontin, Percocet, Roxycontin, Vicodin, etc. getting sued for billions of dollars?

It seems like they just chose the biggest fish that they could get the most money out of. Not the companies that actually caused the problem.
Does this mean West Virginia gets like 100 billion?  That poor state was fucked over hard.
Every single penny should go to the rehabilitation treatment to those lives that have been destroyed by the greed of these corporations.
>$580 million to just Oklahoma, imagine what the national lawsuits could get

.

>The fine was significantly less than the penalties sought by Oklahoma, sending J&J’s stock up about 2% in post-market trading after the verdict was read.

So either the plaintiffs were overstating the damages or this is small fries to the damage J&J did.

Doesn't matter because J&J will appeal.
Well they likely f***** it up because they pre-allocated the money but a lot of the money could be based on Medicare prescriptions of which they will have to reimburse the government so oops
[deleted]
Wouldn't double jeopardy come into play?  (Asking)
They were asking 17 billion. Half a Bn is a drop in the bucket and will not go very far in a statewide crisis, but it is a start.
That'd be nearly 1/3rd of their revenue if 50 states got that payout. . Not sure how I feel about that.
This is based marketing alone, the logistics chain is supplier, manufacturer, pharmacy, doctor. J&J is the first tier and can't have access to the number of pills produced by manufacturer via HIPAA, just so people know that it's not that they were just dumping pills out on the street, but being deceptive on their marketing (still extremely corrupt). If you don't know pharma logistics, don't pretend to think you know the full story.
Ohhhhh. I thought it was an outrageously low sum. I mean, I know there wont be real justice, but...
This is literally pocket change for them. Unless assholes go to jail they'll just pay the tickets - often with taxpayer money.
didn't they want 20 billion? if so, this doesn't seem like a great deal.

their stock is up a couple points... so I'm guessing this is actually a victory for jandj
>The fine was significantly less than the penalties sought by Oklahoma,  sending J&J’s stock up by about 2% in post-market trading after the  verdict was read. Investors were expecting J&J to be fined between  $500 million and $5 billion, according to Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth  Anderson. 

I don't think they mind much.
The state sued for 17 BILLION. They got about 3.4% of that. JNJs stock actually went up in after hours trading. 


Imagine what a real win would look like for victims. Because this wasn't it.
Still far too little for the cost of all those lives lost and destroyed. The CEOs and upper management should all spend life in prison.
I feel another corporate tax cut coming.
Their stock jumped 4 % when they weren't fined the full 1.7 billion so they actually ended up making money this time. Hopefully we get an administrator that is sincere about holding these people accountable
Oklahoman here:
J&J actually considers this a win, because prosecutors were originally asking for $17B.
I'm proud of my state for this and simultaneously legalizing MJ.
It doesn't quite work that way.  Victory by the state of Oklahoma came by really stretching and perhaps abusing a law that's somehow novel to Oklahoma.  Other states don't have the same loophole to exploit.
All that money is going to Oklahoma state university to study addiction. 

It’s not actually benefitting anyone. 

Living half an hour away from them, they piss me off.
https://reason.com/2019/08/21/new-survey-data-confirm-that-opioid-deaths-do-not-correlate-with-pain-pill-abuse-or-addiction-rates/
What did J & J do ? I must have missed it.
An undisclosed settlement
You know that is only 2% of their 2018 yearly income. Doesn’t really seem like a punishment to me... more of a slap on the wrist. I make $50,000 a year and that’s like me paying $1,500 for contributing to a crisis that has left tens of thousands dead.
Well J&J has total assets above $160 billion. I really hope that this isn't the end of their punishment, they most definitely profited multiple billions pushing opioids
Next is a federal case in Ohio consisting of a conglomeration of almost 2000 cases from various states, cities, tribes and others. This is supposed to start in the fall of this year.
Personally I trust judges to pick fair amounts in these circumstances. AGs have a political motivation to ask for as much as possible. Judges are more insulated from that pressure. This is what the system looks like when it's working. At least, that's my opinion until I see something to convince me otherwise.
Jannsen is owned by JNJ.
You're right. In fact, their stocks went UP based on this amount, because it's much less than the state was seeking. 

That being said, this is the first of what might be hundreds of law suits. This is just one state.
There are 2000 lawsuits lined up into one big lawsuit... that one has not started.
I think this is just the beginning
If every state in the union settles for this much, they would be in a bad way financially speaking—I mean, that would be like $29 billion dollars.
Once they're held liable, then every subsequent case is precedented. 

It won't break them, but it'll fuck 'em pretty hard, *a la* the tobacco companies.
If it makes you feel better Johnson & Johnson sold less than half a percent of all opioids and Oklahoma was less than 2% of the country. Total liability for everyone could easily still be >$100 billion. 

JNJ only got hit with a judgment this high because 1) they were dicks and refused to settle and 2) they can afford it
No, it shouldn't. J&J provided a heavily regulated product completely within government regulations, along with every other company that received manufacturing approval. The FDA should be the ones under scrutiny. This is like suing Coca-Cola for obesity and diabetes. Yes, they are a huge cause, but they were 100% within their rights to market their product. Opiates have been known within the accredited medical community for over 200 years, they are in essence, pretty much all the same. Some last longer, some hit harder, but pretty much the same.

*edit- And the alternatives are pretty much just Tramadol and NSAIDs. It isn't like there was a better alternative to chronic pain. If Tramadol doesn't work for the pain, what option is left? Oh, opiates are a no go because some percentage of people abuse them. You just have to suffer the rest of your life.
The cost of doing business
I don’t think it should. The doctors who prescribed it are most culpable. It’s like someone who was murdered suing Smith and Wesson for manufacturing the gun that killed the person.
no it shouldnt bankrupt them. it's a huge company with many divisions and they make a TON of great products.
It should bankrupt the expert doctors that permitted opioid abuse and spread the epidemic. It should remove their license to practice medicine.
most likely the company will pay out less than that may, down to 50 million.
Your quality of life would be reduced if J&J ceased to exist. 

Why do you wish for that?
I'd assume there'd be some sort of insurance or at least a fund set aside for suits like this, so it doesn't really affect the company much if at all.
Stocks surged because of how small this payout was because it was expected to be larger.
That is only 2% of their 2018 yearly income. Doesn’t really seem like a punishment to me... more of a slap on the wrist. I make $50,000 a year and that’s like me paying $1,500 for contributing to a crisis that has left tens of thousands dead.
Roughly 3% of their annual earnings and 0.6% of their annual revenue. Yeah they sure learned their lesson
The company should receive capital punishment. Freeze their accounts, seize all of their assets, and charge all executives. Sell the company's assets to compensate their victims.
Every investor should have to pay back the last 35 years worth of dividends
You want to wipe out a company that employs 130,000 people across the globe?
JNJ isn’t to blame for the opioid problem. They only sold 1% of the opioids in the state. And on of their products was an opioid patch. 

This is a highly misguided lawsuit.. the state should be suing the hospitals and doctors who prescribed these pills at outrageous high #s. There were warning labels on the pack.
But that’s part of the problem—the pharmaceutical industry undersold the level of addictiveness of these drugs to the doctors. Not saying that doctors don’t have a tendency to over prescribe for various reasons, but opiates were first marketed by the pharmaceutical industry as being “safe, non addictive” pain treatment options. They pushed and pushed doctors to hand these out like candy. I agree that there’s a lot of blame to go around but the highest culpable party here is definitely big pharma.
I had some pretty severe disc issues about 10 years ago, and was all but immobilized because of pain.  The fentanyl patch made life possible.   It got tiresome being treated like a junkie by some pharmacists (at the time, in my area, there was an influx of morally-conservative Christians entering the practice as a kind of back-door attack on morning after pills and birth control.)

I'm concerned there will be a backlash against the availability of these options for people in the position I was in.  Due to the nature of that injury, it's almost inevitable it will happen again. 

Aside from the human misery caused by addiction and overdose, making "the right tool for the job" harder to get is going to take a toll as well.
Not exactly. They didn't just make the drug, they advertised it and sold it to doctors. Do the doctors deseve some of the blame? Sure, but they were still veing told by the people who made the drugs that was safe.
agreed. And J&J products only made up 1% of opiate meds. 

Should drug companies just stop making any opiate pain med period? Because that's what this is eventually doing. No one will want to make pain meds, and no doctor will want to prescribe them. 

I think these lawsuits are ridiculous. It discourages pain treatment, it goes after the wrong people, and it's just a measure to make people feel better, that "something is being done". It's bullshit.
They’re all at fault, j and j, Purdue etc pushed to get lax regulation of their painkillers and the doctors prescribing them. These doctors just took advantage of the situation these companies created. They are both at fault, these companies the most so

Edit: it’s like Pablo Escobar and the guy selling on the block, who has the real responsibility

Edit 2: a better comparison is that you want to sue the cashiers since they served the food instead of McDonalds for obseity, but that’s still bad since doctors have some fault
It sounding like a big number in no way means it’s proportional.
Finally someone with sense
Hopefully the ruling stands on appeal.
Agreed but their should be criminal action seriously considered at the end of this

Kinda ridiculous to say these companies knowingly devastated the country and nobody goes to jail
Their stock shot up after this ruling. I know $580m sounds like a lot, but the investors aren't stupid; this is a slap on the wrist and everyone involved knows it.
It's .7% of their 2017 revenue.

For comparison, if the average American income is 56,000, .7% would be about $400.

So, in fact, the judge charged them less in total for ruining countless lives through false opioid ads and misrepresenting their addictive qualities,  than most folks pay PER MONTH in rent. 

Johnson and Johnson will make back that money in about 62 hours (81.5B / 52 weeks / 168 hours in a week)

Let's take it once step furthur. Let's say all 50 states sue, win, and are awarded the same amount as OK.

50 x 580m = 29B

29B / 81B = 35.5%

35.5% out of  1 years income to pay for damages done that have helped lead to the opioid crisis we are in. 

In comparison, it would be like an average citizen buying a new car with cash. Yeah it might hurt in the short term, but mind you this company has a net worth of 360 Billion. So even then, it's less than 10% of their net worth. 

It'll sting a bit if it gets to that level too... kinda like a slap on the wrist.
If you think this is a win then you’re not looking at this with any depth. 

Their stocks surged after the ruling.
Johnson & Johnson has announced raising drug prices last year and again this year, but they're not trying to cover earnings that have been lost; they're raising prices because Congress has been considering legislation to lower prices. https://www.biospace.com/article/j-and-j-increases-the-price-on-medications-as-more-bills-are-filed-in-congress-to-lower-drug-costs/ They're raising their prices to reduce the impact of future lost earnings from any legislation to reduce drug prices.
I was a while ago but when I got my wisdom teeth out I was told to take pain killers for 2 weeks. I was given a 3 week supply.
Is there any onus on the doctors seeing these patients week after week and refilling the scripts? If we're gonna talk about preventing this epidemic, we need to look at all parties involved
This crown belongs to you.
Yes, that is how the legal system works. Would you prefer it worked differently?
That's an odd way to spell negotiation.
Why would they appeal?  They won.
Oklahoma already sued Purdue Pharma and got a $270 million settlement, not sure about any other states/federal jurisdictions though.
For the first one- the state filed it first. That’s pretty much it.

Second- not sure. That’s not going to be quite as simple as this, relatively.
They’re more of the branches, or each node in the canopy.

Pharmaceuticals are the root and stalk.
did your father not follow the doctors instructions?
For one state dude. There's 49 more if you haven't noticed. How about we trust the professional judge's reasoning. I'm sure they didn't just make that number up.
This just in: Bank robber who stole $500,000 has been fined $37.54, will face no prison time
500M is more then I honestly thought would happen. Like there's no hope for some of my friends.  But if even a fraction of this money goes to naecan and treatment that's more lifes then had a chance before
Shouldn't you be comparing the damages reward to their net earnings from just Oklahoma, given that the reward only accounts for damages done to Oklahoma citizens?
~~drug dealers~~ pharmaceutical companies. And probably yes but probably not successfully because they pour millions into campaigns and legislation.
They didn't. JNJ opioid sales made up less than 1% of the sales in the state, and a good piece of that 1% was low dose slow release patches.
Imagine screwing up so bad that the most expensive lawyers in the world can't come up with anything better than that.
The State of Oklahoma.

But nothing is settled yet, due to appeal.
It's staying!
Oklahoma's Supreme Court could decide to hear the appeal, but even if they  do there's no guarantee they would reduce the award amount.
No that was in response to the asbestos lawsuit result in July.
J&J manufacture 1% of the opioids sold in the US. How are they taking the blame for the opioid crisis?
They're not arguing a technicality.  They're saying that the company's actions didn't cause the opioid epidemic or the resulting damages.  Causation would have to be proved in these circumstances no matter what legal theory you go with.  They're only lampooning the public nuisance cause of action because A) That's the cause of action they're defending against, and B) It emphasizes that there is a much more attenuated chain of causation in this case than in your typical public nuisance action.
Don’t know how much third will effect it but it was not a jury trial.

Hi I'm Reddit and I don't understand the difference between revenue and net profit margins.
Did they make that 20 billion specifically from the opioid products sold by the Janssen division within the boundaries of Oklahoma? Because talking about revenue from toothpaste they sold in Germany isn't really relevant to this case.
Normally, I'd agree, but this could be a "death by a thousand paper cuts" scenario. These companies have *thousands* of these opioid lawsuits filed against them by local and state governments. If this is the average take, you're looking at just a few judgments against J&J before their financial future is jeopardized.
Stop being an armchair lawyer and take the win.
Yes that is exactly what it means. Florida is an even more apt example than you realize as Florida had HUGE pill mill problems. ~10 years ago, I-95 the nations largest north-south interstate had Pill mills littering every exit in Florida. The state began fighting them with new state laws but the problem persisted. Sometime google "Florida pill mill problem" if you want to know more.  Effectively most of the pills distributed in the south came through Florida and the state spent billions fighting it. J&J has **massive** exposure to a lot of states, but Florida has perhaps the most powerful claim against them. I would expect a huge lawsuit very soon.
There is currently a massive consolidated case against dozens of opioid manufacturers (like how it was for the master tobacco lawsuit) in federal court in Ohio which comprises some ~2,000 state, municipal, county, tribal, and other parties.

I think that case is set for trial sometime late this year
Oklahoma sued them under a specific "Public Nuisance" state law, so other states can also sue...if they also have applicable laws.
Not really. The other states could have sued whenever they wanted to. This doesn't change that. All states have the same exact ability to sue as they had before.
think of all the meth that Florida can buy with that.
This is what the other states have been waiting for.
Imagine Texas
If J&J has been playing the same game as the other pharmas, their patents are all actually owned by a different company. So maybe what's next is a series of very creative bankruptcy filings?
JNJ was Snow White compared to the major opioid pushers like Purdue.  Reddit doesn't realize this, but JnJ is not the main bad guy in this case.  They sold a tiny and probably appropriate fraction of opioids, and are probably not very guilty.  That's why they chose to face trial rather than do what their ugly cousins did which was to admit guilt and pay a settlement. 

Johnson and Johnson knew this would be about taking some lumps for merely being associated with painkillers, but they didn't want to admit guilt. They also took issue with the means of the lawsuit which, depending on your view, is either a bastardization of the law or a clever but kind of stretched leverage of the law.

The only reason people/Reddit are ragging on Johnson and Johnson today is because they chose to fight and thus there's a trial with news coverage.  The much bigger villains chose to slink away with a quiet no-fault settlement.  

Johnson and Johnson could have done a settlement too, probably for similar cost.  But they would have had to make a false confession and lump themselves in with more obvious villains like Purdue pharma.
in OKC here, this was just step one.  The JnJ cased was pretty open/shut and can be used as a precedent for the others.  Our state AG isn't anywhere near done yet.  Theres also talk of a state question to take a large portion of this money and set it aside for state provided care for this problem specifically.
Almost heaven...
Well the WV attorney general thought he was the best knees for getting 2 million. Not sure if WV can go after more.
It should. It won't. 

We don't rehabilitate in Oklahoma. We lock people up every chance we get, especially for drugs. We all know the US leads the world in incarceration rate but if states counted as countries Oklahoma would beat out every NATO country and every US state [by a wide margin.](https://okpolicy.org/accepting-our-highest-in-the-world-incarceration-rate-means-believing-that-oklahomans-are-the-worst-people/)

I hope something good gets done with it. Every in-house treatment facility I was in was nothing more than tossing you in a room with a bunch of other people to sweat it out for ten days or so, then out you went. If you wanted suboxone or anything like that it was around $1000 extra up front. Few junkies can afford that.

Every long term rehab with state beds I looked into had waiting lists at least six months long. The supply is low and demand is high.
Do people who take opioids really not understand that they are addictive?
[removed]
It goes into the "general fund", too, so I'm betting they're going to squander it somehow and it'll be gone quickly.

It should really go into treatment for those affected.
no, this is a civil suit and was specific to Oklahoma, not that J&J will actually wind up paying anywhere near this amount
NAL but I assume that different states/jurisdictions come in the play in regards to that.
The Ohio case is a bellwether case in the multi-district litigation (MDL).  It won't necessarily decide the fate of the other 2,000 cases; it's more or less tried on its own.

There are other bellwether cases that will follow.  The idea is that, after a few of these bellwether cases go to trial, the results indicate the direction the wind is blowing and will drive settlement in the remaining cases.

Ah yes an almost half trillion dollar company has to be 500 million. That’s a real deterrent for future behavior.
>This is what the system looks like when it's working. At least, that's my opinion until I see something to convince me otherwise.

Depends on the state. Some states require judges to win elections or are political appointees. Judge can rule the company had an "otherwise blameless business record"
Judges are frequently elected and also have a political motive, but they definitely serve as an insulating factor as they have a completely different political basis.
I know. Was going off the judges comment. Referring to them as separate entities makes sure that both are held culpable just in case, I THINK. But I'm not a lawyer, so could be very wrong.
It went up because the uncertainty is gone -- before, people weren't exactly sure what would happen -- now that this uncertainty is gone, the stock goes up.

It often happens after lawsuits end.
And it sets a precedent
Until a judge inevitably sets a precedent where they become unsueable...
Yeah, the NY Times article about this same story points that out too, as well as the potential effect on other companies: 

> The closely watched case could be a dire harbinger for some two dozen opioid makers, distributors and retailers that face more than 2,000 similar lawsuits around the country.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/health/oklahoma-opioids-johnson-and-johnson.html
It's still not enough to cover the damages within the state, assuming the state was being reasonable with their damages estimate.  If that's the case, this is the beginning of bad things for J&J's victims.
[deleted]
J&J is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. They could absorb $30B.
The tobacco companies were doing great, they just moved their business to other countries. It's only really since 2018 with a global shift away from smoking that they've finally taken a real hit. As for the lawsuits, they just passed the costs along.
Phillip Morris bought 35% of Juul for 13 billion. Really got broke lol.
> Once they're held liable, then every subsequent case is precedented.

That's not how legal precedent works. A precedent is a finding of law, a trial/verdict is a finding of fact. 

But it will make J&J more scared to lose in the future, and provide a road map for other plaintiffs in the future.
lol...no it won’t

That actually does make me feel better, then. About a hundred billion in liability for just the state of Oklahoma sounds about right, split between the opioid makers

Had to scroll a long way to find some clear thinking. Thank you u/kacmandoth
They literally marketed the drug as less addictive than traditional opioids.

Edit: Nobody is saying we shouldn't use oxycontin etc, just that the way it was presented to doctors was misleading. A better comparison would be if Coca Cola advertised regular Coke as zero/low calorie when it isn't.

Unfortunately it’s a lot more complicated than that. 

1. States are just now starting to implement good opioid prescription tracking mechanisms. 
2. A lot of doctors were truly trying to help, and with the increasing prevalence of threats of lawsuits and hospitals rating doctors off of patient feedback (negatively rated for patients complaining they were unhappy with service) it becomes easier to give them something to make them go away. It’s why antibiotics are given out for the flu/colds, or tamuflu (even though a lot of patients are beyond the effective window)
3. It also has a lot to do with patients not wanting to put in the work to deal with more effective treatments, such as pain management, and would instead rather pop a pill and not inconvenience their lives (again, refer to tamuflu and antibiotics, as healthy individuals are perfectly capable of fighting off the infections on their own)
I got in a fucking argument on here a few months back for saying the same damn thing. Some cunt was trying to say doctors couldn't have known opioids would be abused and be highly addictive... As of we haven't been aware of opioids and their effects for hundreds of fucking years.
"Should" as in moral consequence or "should" as in reasonably likely?
How about in jail for murder
I’m willing to make short term sacrifices for long term gains. I want companies to act ethically, and since it’s been shown time and time again that companies will act unethically for profit, we need a punishment for unethical actions that isn’t just a “cost of doing business” level fine.
What? No, J&J are *very much* to blame for the opioid epidemic. They downplayed the risks and overstated the benefits of the deugs they were selling to make a higher profit with no regard for the destruction they were causing. 

That is literally the ruling made in this court case. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/health/oklahoma-opioids-johnson-and-johnson.html

And those doctors *are* getting their punishment as well. The Justice Department charged over 600 people, out of which 165 doctors or other health care professionals connected to the opioid epidemic. Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/more-than-600-charged-in-nations-largest-heath-care-fraud-investigation/2018/06/28/fe45113a-7ae3-11e8-93cc-6d3beccdd7a3_story.html

You’re spreading disinformation.
When I had my first C-section in 2008, I had another doctor than mine discharge me from the hospital. He wrote me a script for 200 Lortabs (Vicodin). 200! My prescription cost was $7. I used maybe 10 of them over the next month.  There is no scenario where *any* doctor should be writing scripts for 200 Lortabs. There is no scenario where *any* pharmacist should be filling a script for that many Lortabs without verifying with the doctor that it isn’t a typo. It’s not like a pack of gummy bears.
What did they know and when did they know it?
I’m not trying to give the drug companies a pass, not by any means, and I’m not talking about legit doctors. I’m talking about doctors who do nothing but write prescriptions, doctors who literally have the prescriptions filled out in advance, before the patient ever comes in.
Even so, how would a doctor not know opioids are addictive? It’s common sense.
Doctors are smart enough (or they should be) to know that all opioids are extremely addictive.

That said, it's a shared blame thing between them and the companies who incentivised them to prescribe addictive drugs unnecessarily.
Honestly, more blame should probably be passed to the addicts themselves, who in many cases probably pushed the doctors to prescribe more.
\>They didn't just make the drug, they advertised it and sold it to doctors.

How can doctors prescribe medicine they don't know exists?
The idea that the doctors were unintentionally selling an unsafe drug is, frankly, asinine. 
Doctors, nurses, all the way down to CNAs and EMTs know the dangers associated with opioids. 
And they ARE safe when used correctly. Like cars. How do I sue Honda because my relative was killed by someone driving a Civic?
They manufacture just 1% of the opioids sold in the US. How are they taking the blame for the opioid crisis?
Well as long as the idiots slamming them down their throats don't have to take any responsibility.
The pharmaceutical companies sold the opiates to doctors saying they were non-addictive or less addictive. Now we're in an opiate crisis. This is why they're being sued. They sold under false claims and led to thousands of deaths. How is this lawsuit ridiculous? Who would you suggest it go after instead?
It's $580 million for one state for one year, with the option left open for them to prove damages for the other 29 years they were alleging in the future.  That's pretty proportional, as a matter of fact.

Not to mention J&J isn't even the biggest player in this, they're just the biggest ones who thought they could win at a trial.
What criminal charges specifically would you have brought?
You don't know what you're talking about. The fee was already priced in. The market doesn't just ignore potential lawsuits. It was just less than the market thought.
This guy doesn't invest.
Do you not understand profit vs revenue? Do you think they made all 81 billion on opioid sales? Judges don't just make these numbers up. It's one state's fine from one year. They're potentially on the hook for several billion more for the next few years. It's a fair amount and an important precedent until I hear evidence to the contrary.

You're angry and you want to be an armchair judge. Let the professionals determine the right amount.
The fee was already priced in. The market doesn't just ignore potential lawsuits. It was just less than the market thought.
No, not at all. Just saying there’s going to be an appeal lol.
I'd prefer if there weren't two justice systems in the US...one for those with money and one for those without it.
I personally would prefer if large corporations could not get around laws by using expensive lawyers with dubious tactics to basically buy wins in many cases.
Oklahoma won.  Johnson & Johnson lost and has already stated their intent to appeal.
Could it be that the Rx writers have less money than the big pharma?
While the addiction developed? Most certainly. He actually noticed the addiction coming on and tried to talk to the doctor about it. The doctor told him that he’d “be on these pills for the rest of his life to moderate the pain, so don’t worry about it. “
the street prices out judgements for everything bud
If you had to guess how many companies sell fentanyl in the US, would it be more or less than 30?
Yea, so that's actually a fair point. In the interest of being fair, I did a little bit of digging. J&J's annual filing doesn't break out opioid sales explicitly nor does it necessarily break out those sales by state. So I did a little bit of googling, but I wasn't able to find any concrete $$ statistics on how big the opioid market is in Oklahoma nor how much market share J&J has in this space.

But this is what I did find:
J&J has 36.3 billion, 33.5 billion, and 31.4 billion in pharma sales during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. J&J breaks out its pharma sales into 6 specific categories:
1) Immunology
2) Infectious Diseases
3) Neuroscience
4) Oncology
5) Pulmonary Hypertension
6) Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other

J&J explicitly details the $$ sales of the 2-3 major drugs in each of these categories and then each category, J&J has an "other" section to show the drug sales of the remaining drugs clumped altogether. None of the drugs explicitly named in the statement are opioids, so they are presumably grouped into one or more of the "other" sections. 

My guess is that opioids are classified in the 6th group-- "Cardiovascular/metabolism/other" (although I could also see them being included in the oncology section). 

The amount of sales of "other" group in Category 6 amounts to $1.7 billion in 2017 (similar numbers in 2016/2015). Presumably, most of these sales are NOT opioids, but there is no way to know from the statement what percentage are opioids.

From later on in the statement, we can see that pharma income (pre tax) is ~30-38% of total sales. Assuming that pharma expenses are uniform for all drugs (which is most certainly NOT true), the 2017 income from that "other" group of drugs is $646m at most.

And again, that $646m almost certainly includes more than just opioid income. J&J's annual earnings for opioids are likely much lower than $646m.

So at this point, I couldn't help but notice that $572m is a much larger number relative to the annual income that opioids probably bring in. Presuming that other state lawsuits result in damages of a similar $$ amount, then the overall cost of these lawsuits will more than exceed the (recent) earnings J&J received from selling opioids. 

So in conclusion, I was (probably) WRONG. At the surface, this can look like the cost of doing business, but that appears to be incorrect. I don't have the exact numbers but it looks as though J&J's endeavor to sell opioids (at least in recent years) was probably unprofitable due to this lawsuit. And if it is somehow still profitable, I would imagine that after the next series of lawsuits, it won't be anymore. 

Hope that I conveyed the above clearly, but let me know if you need some clarification regarding the research. This was a fun exercise.

I know that it won't be proportional if Florida sued and won against Johnson and Johnson, but if the lawsuit was based only on state population, Florida could potentially get **$3.045 Billion** in damages at the ratio of population to award.
I’m fairly certain Florida is where that phrase actually came from, or at the very least what made it so well known.

There was even a "halfway house owner" who was feeding his "clients:(?) Drugs- then prostituting them out- some were raped- crazy ass florida

Also, as far as those pill mills go, they said on tv the other day, that in 1 part of broward county, there was more pill mills than mcdonalds
Watching this on VICE right now....had no idea these shops existed and were legal...WTF
There was an awesome nosleep on the Florida pill mills. 5 star story. Can't remember who did it.
Provided that J&J acted in those other states the same as it did in Oklahoma, eg. with its advertising campaigns to the public and targeting high-volume prescribing doctors...
Seriously, im in Tampa and there are 4 "pharmacies"(not counting walgreens, CVS, walmart etc) within 2 miles. 2 within 1000 feet of a school.

There are probably more than pill mills than that, those are the ones I notice.
Except Pam Bondi and Rick Scott should be convicted, in FL. They decided there was no pill mill crisis.
Florida is ruled by Republicans who have demonstrated time and time again that their policy of governance is essentially, "fuck the poor". Florida politician's will gladly push a small settlement or ruling to keep their corporate overlords happy.

To clarify for some misguided white knights, Johnson and Johnson sold some opioids, but in very small quantities and in a more responsible manner than the horror stories we've heard about other companies.

JnJ isn't on trial and in the news this week because they were the biggest or the worst.  They're in the news because they chose to defend against the allegations, because they too few their role was more minor and less heinous.

There seem to be a lot of people who just hear a pharma company name and don't know or don't want to know the distinctions between them or to understand what one company did compared to another.

Not all pharma companies had the same motive, intent, behavior or impact.  It's misguided to lump them all together.

There's collective hate for all pharma companies which I understand and share.  But for those who want to know the context and relevance, I'm providing it.  And once you know that context, the trials and settlements and fines will make more sense and might help avoid some unnecessary agita.
> They also took issue with the means of the lawsuit which, depending on your view, is either a bastardization of the law or a clever but kind of stretched leverage of the law.

So you're saying they didn't lie about the addictiveness of the opioids? They have proof, and now a conviction, saying that they did indeed do that. They sold their product and told doctors to prescribe it based on the fact that it was supposedly not addictive.

Stop saying they would have made a "false confession" when they were just convicted of what they were charged with.
The issue is that the money is coming from the wrong source, not that it shouldn't be used for abatement. JnJ played an insignificant role in this epidemic. My point is that the actual companies that REALLY caused the problem and REALLY profited from the epidemic should be paying to abate it.
Well with all the corpses
That’s insane. I’m in New Jersey where our opiate addiction crisis is also crazy. As someone that personally went through it, I know first hand how awful it is. 

BUT! Luckily, in my state they’re not locking up nearly as many people for things like possession and the state is offering things like drug court and rehabs if you’re caught. I’ve met several people that were arrested and put on drug court and it completely changed their lives. Definitely a smarter way to go about it than just locking people up.
So essentially this money will go to the private prison companies and treatment facilities. Basically from one crooked wallet to another.
Money and compassion for the user is frowned upon in this state. I've had dozens of conversations endimg 1 of 2 ways.

You're right, we blame the addict and need to adress the health-care needs of addicts to help them.

Nah it's a choice and they choose to break the law and deserve to be locked up.

I live in OK, which do you think I hear most?

Oklahoma like Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi and others are having a meth and opioid epidemic.

My friends and my family are directly affected it is very real.
We also run slave labor for private corporations, and call it "rehabilitation." The options for people in these "rehab facilities" are to either go to jail or go to work for the chicken factories, and all of their money goes to the facility housing them.

Most likely to our lovely privatized prison system.
How long are you anticipating the suit to take?
check it out now.

Since discovering Leonard French, my favorite copy right attorney,  (Or is it your?  I'm not sure how it works when he's not saying it), I really find attorneys giving the rundown on how things stand, as the law is almost opaque to anyone that doesn't study it.
It is if the action they caused earned lesd then 500million compared to normal methods.

If I make 240 million using legal normal methods, but 300 million illegally, and the lawsuit is 200 million, that's going to make me think about doing it again as it cost me 140 million essentially.  Sure I still walked with 100 million, but I would have walked with 240 had I not done it. Total value is meaningless. J&J isnt worth half a trillion because of Oklahoma or even one product.

I'm not clear on the specifics however, so this is purely hypothetical.
All relevant parties are named in a lawsuit; there were three Jannsen affiliates named in the court order. It was ultimately Jannsen that made the drugs but since it is a wholly owned subsidiary there really isn’t much difference as to who pays the fine.
Yea, the only thing markets don’t like is uncertainty. Up or down, people make money.
That’s not entirely true. JNJ accrued for this lawsuit and the amount was less than the money set aside. Other states are suing but they’ll eventually settle one big lawsuit with all of them as tends to happen with these cases. And it’ll end up being far less than all of them had been seeking. 

Markets hate uncertainty but also this was a “good” outcome for them. Keep in mind that this settlement is less than 1% of 2018’s revenues. As with most of these drug lawsuits, they’ll end up making far more from the drug than they’ll pay out in any lawsuit. See the [risperdal](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/miracleindustry/americas-most-admired-lawbreaker/) settlement (incredible article worth the read if you have an hour or two to kill).

I really hope this case is the first domino in the series.

It’s why antibiotics are given out for the flu/colds, or tamuflu (even though a lot of patients are beyond the effective window)

This particular part drives me nuts. Wife works in an Urgent Care clinic and they're all judged based on their survey scores. They'll get negative reviews for stupid things like they called an ambulance for someone showing signs of a heart attack, or they'll tell people to to go the ER, or they'll refuse to refill prescriptions from someones primary care provider.  
  
Medical care (physical, like a physician) shouldn't be about making people happy and giving them what they want, it should be about making their bodies healthy. If this means you deal with a little discomfort while recovering from an injury, then you deal with the discomfort. If this means you don't get prescribed something for a cough you've had for 4 hours, then you wait and come back if it gets worse.
I would also add 3a: A lot of health insurance plans don't cover a lot of treatments, like physical therapy. When a (not-rich) person has to choose between paying out of pocket for repeated staff-intensive procedures and diagnostics, or picking up a scrip for 10$, well, most families "choose" the scrip.

It is a concerted effort to get the most pills sold, regardless of what it costs the patient.
Doctors have many years of specialized training and a license to practice medicine.  They are the gatekeepers of prescription medicines that are dangerous if taken improperly.
Drug labels had it on them. There is no way the doctors didnt know.
Moral consequence. In reality the lawyers are just going after the biggest pocketbook to grab money.

> There is no scenario where any pharmacist should be filling a script for that many Lortabs without verifying with the doctor that it isn’t a typo. It’s not like a pack of gummy bears.

Pharma companies were taking them all out to nice dinners at the time - so plenty of reasons to not ask questions.
That’s what I’m asking too. I’m 41 yo and I’ve known for a very long time that opioids (pills) were in the same family as heroin and opium. So how do I know that and not doctors?? So yes big pharma knew that and should be held responsible but doctors should have known too. The ignorance plea ain’t working
This guy?

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jailed-doctor-barry-schultz-interview-opioid-epidemic-60-minutes-2019-08-25/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jailed-doctor-barry-schultz-interview-opioid-epidemic-60-minutes-2019-08-25/)
They were specifically told it was not. Oxy was suppose to be a magic pill with no downsides, the pharmaceutical reps promised.
I commented an explanation to your question to another commentor below, please read
Because this isn't just any product. This is a potentially dangerous drug and it wasn't advertised as such.
There is plenty of "continuing education" in healthcare, docs and nurses are always reading up on something as a condition for employment and licensure. The seller's ad is not the only way to receive information nor is it typically the most reliable, especially if they advertise under false claims such as with opioids.
Because they knew very quickly that the drugs weren't entirely safe and that it was easy to a use them.
If a car manufacturer advertised a cars safetey feature working a certain way and the crash was because that feature failed and actually didn't work that way at all couldn't you sue them for that?
Let's say that 1/4 Honda's accidentally injures the driver. Honda tells the dealers everything is fine, the cars are safe, and the reports are wrong. Then it comes out the reports are right.

Do you sue Honda or the dealer?

Now I'm *not* giving the doctors a pass here, but it's totally find to sue the manufacturer for a defect in the product they were not being transparent about.
That's not neccessarily true to the extent that is important here. Healthcare workers are aware that you can OD, that chronic use causes bowel obstructions - some dangers were known. It's not fair to say that everyone knew that prescription use would be the biggest indicator for later addiction. Studies were produced by "big pharma" that said otherwise even.
Other companies can now be sued.
I don’t disagree with what you’re saying in a lot of instances. I knew several people in my high school and college years who liked to take pills strictly recreationally. If you take something to get high that you know is illegal because of the harm it will do to you, you should hold some responsibility for the harm you willingly risked. 

However, I know a lot of people who were in an accident, otherwise injured, or just had a medical procedure and given these highly addictive drugs that were way overkill for what they needed and became addicted. I know when I got a root canal I was given Ibuprofen and Vicodin. The Ibuprofen was more than enough for the pain, and I didn’t like how the Vicodin made me feel. I know one guy in particular that now has a non-profit helping addicts that had never done drugs or alcohol in his life, was highly successful, and got in a car accident. He was prescribed addictive medication and became extremely addicted and it ruined his life. He eventually got off and now helps others. 

You need to remember these are addictive. Yes, in some instances people initially took them for bad reasons, but regardless of the reason the first time, continuing to take them wasn’t entirely their choice. 

Back to the first case of people taking them to get high. J&J illegally made these available through pill mills to people that shouldn’t have had access to them.  So while the drug users have some responsibility, and really, you’re quite misinformed if you don’t know that drug users face legal consequences every day for what they’ve done to break the law, this is J&J facing their responsibility for breaking the law, destroying people’s lives, and having a horrible impact on our society all in the name of profit.
Yeah man these idiots being prescribed things for their pain while trusting medical professionals not to fuck them over. What morons! Go fuck yourself buddy.
Conspiracy, fraud, perhaps manslaughter if you wanna really go ballsy I’m sure there is more in not a prosecutor but if what they did isn’t a crime than what is
You were bitching about it, don't lie.
That's completely irrelevant to the comment you replied to.
oh look it’s this rhetoric again
I don't understand, how did we just get a $580 million ruling then? Shouldn't J&J have been left off scot free?
I'm sorry that our legal system annoys you. Yes, it has that pesky presumption of innocence, but as long as you know who's guilty and who's innocent we can probably just skip that.
Or they had an incentive and counterintuitive data provided by big pharma to go against medical training
sorry about your loss btw.

it does seem like the doctor wasnt unaware of the addictive nature and while its awful easy for me to say now, the doctor should of been more help on that one. plenty of terribly sad stories with this mess anyways
$3B is folding money for Johnson & Johnson. 

This shit won’t stop until executives are serving life sentences.
Actually, that is not right based on judgement which I just read. The $572 million that Oklahoma won is JUST for one year. The judge left the judgement amount open for subsequent years. So the $572 mil is just the start for Oklahoma.

This ruling is far more devastating to J&J's future than people realize.
I always wonder what happens to the money. I was 18 when I got hooked on oxy's and going to the pill mills getting an insane amount of "meds". Like my friends who od'd and died do their family's get some money. Or what about all the money my family spent on rehabs for me. Or does this just go into politicians pockets like everything else.
>Johnson & Johnson is an American conglomerate that has a net worth of **$360 billion**  
  
3 billion is nothing.
So change money for this specific drug maker
It is and we cracked down on it hard a long time ago. To the point even getting ADHD meds and such became a pain for a lot of people. At this point if the things are still around, they probably won't be going away anytime soon.
You got any links for that? I'd like to know more, i hadn't heard about any halfway house issues
If you like reading, pick up "AMERICAN PAIN" about the george twins-
As opposed to Oklahoma, which is so Republican even our dirt is red.
Not what I said. Get over yourself.
Drug court around here is a joke too. The costs are beyond what most can pay. I've watched multiple people break down sobbing in meetings because they're doing everything they're supposed to but there's no way they can get thousands of dollars by the deadline after catching charges and losing their jobs. So they go to prison.
>We also run slave labor for private corporations, and call it "rehabilitation." 

Thank you for mentioning that. I should have, I just didn't want to source everything and make a long comment.
That is pretty much the way it goes.
Isn't there a point we get to when murdering people is okay?  

I mean, we kill poachers who are just trying to shoot a lion or an elephant.  We shoot people who are stealing televisions from out homes.  Isn't saying these corporate execs are somehow better, or exempt from violence, just blind hypocrisy?  Why?  Because they're white and wear suits?
Trial on each bellwether can take a few weeks to a month.  The bellwethers are scheduled fairly close to one another.

It's up in the air how long the bulk of the cases in the MDL can take, though.  The defendants can refuse to settle, meaning the rest of the cases keep getting tried and tried for the next few decades.  Or they can settle after a few bellwethers have gone to trial.  

In other words, nobody knows.
According to the article, that wasn’t the basis of the decision. $572 million was the state’s estimate on how much they would spend combating the opioid crisis over the next year. The state estimated it would spend $12.5-17.5 billion over 20 years, but the judge decided they hadn’t provided sufficient evidence of costs and time beyond the first year.
We don’t know what the net profit was illegally compared to legally, so it’s just an assumption to say they earned less then the legal way.
J&J stock rose by over $7 billion following this ruling. They didn't lose money. They \*made\* money through this ruling.
Oh word.
[deleted]
True, but I was just pointing out that investors don't like uncertainty -- so even if the amount was equal to the money they set aside, the stock could still go up. 

But of course the fact that it is less is better for them and the stock.
I looked this up.

*Decisions made by a low-level court do not become binding precedent on courts of higher jurisdiction. Because of this, binding precedent is usually the result of decisions made at the appellate court or supreme court level, though it may apply to decisions made by courts of even, or horizontal, jurisdiction. Binding precedent applies only among courts of the same system, such as a state court hierarchy. Legal precedent set in the federal court system is not generally binding on any state court, though it is commonly used as persuasive precedent.*

[https://legaldictionary.net/precedent/](https://legaldictionary.net/precedent/)

So, is it true that trial courts *do* set precedent but they would only apply within the same ("horizontal") jurisdiction? and that is pretty limited, which is why you and the legal dictionary sort of don't think it counts? (And I don't disagree, just trying to get the pedantry right.)
Sure; but it sends a message to other states that they can do this and that they can win.
That’s true, but some issues in the case may be used as collateral estoppel. And the expert methodology, now evaluated by a court, can be tweaked and applied much more easily. That, plus the fact that other state governments will see this verdict, makes it a no-brainer for other states to go after j&j.
Many big pharma companies are already global corporations with their HQ in other countries

And cannabis. Altria bought big in Canada.

I don't know, but the global trend has been downward, and the world is pretty big. It's the reason major tobacco stocks trended ~20% down since then.
Holy crap, I just saw that Johnson & Johnson’s actually rose in after-hours trading, so Wall Street agrees the company dodged a bullet on this one. Gah.
Actually, no! I hadn’t heard of this one, but there are others like him.
But WE have known that oxy was addictive for years. We the general public knew that but doctors supposedly didn’t?? It’s the same family as opium and heroine ffs
Is this sarcasm? It’s a ducking synthetic opiate. Did they not read themselves about what they were prescribing? The pharma reps promised?
In the 19th century vicious British colonialists used opium to subdue the Chinese. 

What does that make us?
I understand all of that perfectly. My point is that in no other profession would it be ok to do something you should be fully aware isn’t good and then pass the blame to someone else because you fell for the marketing.
So say they lied and committed fraud. 

I don't have a problem with advertisement for medicine.
It was more that the judge seemed to pin the whole crisis at their feet that doesn't feel just.
Yeah you're right,  I never should have assumed a person would understand the direction 'as needed'. How silly of me. I guess its really not their fault they decided to not read the fucking pages on instructions and warnings that came with the shit they put in their own fucking bodies.

Goddamn idiot.
Dude, I'm an attorney. It was a joke.
99% of redditors will revert to empty platitudes if you make them take the next step in their line of thought.
They made billions, were fined millions, and will likely actually pay thousands. But this will only happen after drawing out everything they possibly can in order to make it as painful as possible to hold them to anything resembling accountable. 

What is likely to happen is that the thousands of people dead, and lives ruined, will amount to something under $10 a person and not a one of the *people* who caused all this pain will spend a single night in jail. Meanwhile, people like you will wander around spouting off about how they weren't "left off scot free."

No, they weren't "left off scot free" but it was still massively profitable for them to destroy people. Until these *people* start paying for this kind of shit, in terms that actually impacts them, they won't ever stop doing things like this.
Presumption of innocence =/= the inscrutible legalese and layers of bureaucracy which that makes a (purchaseable) legal elite necessary, and makes it nearly impossible for any average person to interpret the laws by which they are governed, and has made the speedy trial clause into a joke.

But you can continue being snarky when people point out a very serious and real problem.
I value the presumption of innocence. I get frustrated at large corporations getting away with immoral and damaging things by gaming the legal system.

It's definitely a two tier system in that people without resources are prosecuted for things that people with resources seemingly get away with.
That may be true in the beginning.  But damn, still writing Rx in 2019?
Yeah, that seems to be the general consensus. 

There’s a lot more that every party involved could’ve done. No doubt about it.
For reference, Johnson & Johnson's market cap (the value is you take J&J's price per share of stock multiplied by the total number of shares that are on the market...it's a proxy for the approximate value that investors in the market believe J&J to be worth) is roughly $337 billion.  Note that this does not mean that J&J has $337 billion in cash and assets...it's just a rough estimate of the value of the company if someone were to try to buy it.
Yup.  We need to rewrite our incorporation laws to remove protections from liability for wrongdoing.
I would hope that at the least the board of directors will start to keep a better eye on incentives that motivate CEO's and other employees towards such practices. I doubt it though.
this is exactly true.
This ruling will likely be appealed and actually paying anything will be held up by well paid lawyers for decades, if much of anything ever actually gets paid out.
[deleted]
3 billion is 20% of their annual net earnings. That's a huge sum to lose in a year. Their net worth won't matter as much if they have to sell off their holdings to stay afloat.
celebritynetworth.com is probably not the best place to find the values of corporations.

Additionally, the market cap of a company (akd "net worth") is the number of shares times the share value.  That is not money that the company has available to it. If you still want to concentrate on that value; then consider that J&J makes 15 billion a year in profit.  If 20% of the profit is lost to one lawsuit, and there are hundreds more filed, what exactly do you think is going to happen to the share price?
Exactly why a $360 Billion company got off with only a $572 million fine. Financial slap on the wrist.
> JnJ isn't the bad guy in this case.  They sold a very tiny and probably appropriate fraction of opioids, and are probably not very guilty.

Are you fucking serious? Lmao. "Probably not very guilty" when referring to an article, about them being fucking guilty. Not to mention the fact that you gloss over the reason why they were found guilty, which is falsely claiming that these opioids were not addictive (spoiler alert: they knew they were and told doctors otherwise).

Why are you so adamant on defending them when they were clearly found to be guilty here? A court of fucking law found them guilty. Your opinion on this doesn't fucking matter. Get over yourself.
Oof yeah that is definitely one of the downsides. But for me I’ve had multiple friends go through drug court and obviously didn’t want to get clean initially but throughout the process and after being clean for so long they never went back to using. I suppose there’s a good and bad to everything.
The whole things hypothetical. Experts however can do a pretty good amount of narrowing down. They know what was expenses, what other companies make, demand, etc.  

Some of this is basic information for j&j (expenses) and some is extrapolation from other companies records but its all more or less something you can put out there. Companies do it all the time as part of performance reviews.

These numbers the lawyers and judges put forth arent just pulled from hats.
Many commoners do have jobs that match 401k contributions and some even contribute on the commoners behalf regardless of if the employee contributes or not. Their 401k is usually enrolled in a form of mutual funds and the companies that are in these funds are just like J&J. They are “too big to fail”. So actually, yes, a lot of commoners are counting on it as well
You don't have any investments and no retirement plan or pension?
You know “real” people. The ones whose birth certificates are on file in Delaware.
 Because this was a trial, the verdict itself is not precedential. Trials in general do not set precedent, both because juries are (in theory) only allowed to decide things based on the facts presented to them and because in the US trial courts in general cannot create precedent due to their limited jurisdiction. In both (US) state and federal courts, there is no concept of horizontal precedent.
Assuming that those states have laws similar to Oklahoma's Public Nuisance law (which is what they sued J&J under).
>flavored e-cigs

I'm doubtful that what makes children want to get into using e-cigs is the flavors, and more of "wow my older brother/sister blew a huge cloud of smoke" and "it makes me look older because only grown ups can buy it."
Well that's fucking awesome. Last time I checked, the only countries that were trending down in smoking were the US and one other I forgot.
Uncertainty was removed, that's all. The market doesn't like uncertainty.
Cahoots bro. People know things us bourgeoisie don't.
This was a really interesting story. At some point in time a single street in Florida had over 30 pain clinics in operation. 

Crazy man. In the video they show waiting rooms jammed with people looking for dope.
Unfortunately, he isn’t being sarcastic. Your question, if I understand it correctly, is: Why would doctors be so willing to prescribe an opiate, even if big pharma really was in their ear, telling them that it was safe and okay? Everything we know about opiates points to them being unsafe and destructive.

First, you need to realize that Purdue Pharma was AGRESSIVELY marketing OxyContin since it’s introduction to the market. From ‘96 to ‘01, Purdue conducted more than 40 national pain-management conferences at resorts in various high-population states. Physicians—even though they will argue to the contrary—are highly affected by seminars like this. It’s a well-documented psychological/marketing phenomena that doctors are affected by these events, even though they will say that their prescribing patterns are not affected.

Second, Purdue used marketing data to specifically target marketing at certain physicians that were, statistically speaking, MORE likely to prescribe opiates in the first place. This database targeted two things: 1) doctors that had higher numbers of chronic-pain patients and 2) doctors that had been willing to prescribe opiates in the past.

Third, Purdue put a “bounty” on its Opiates. It told its sales force that there would be monetary incentives (commission) if there were an increase of sales of opiates in each salespersons’ region. This made it so that sales representatives had a vested interest in getting regional doctors to prescribe opiates.

With that 3-part strategy, Purdue increased its sales force and started aggressively marketing opiates as a safe, non addictive option. Even if you think it’s impossible, unfortunately, high-quality marketing campaigns like this are effective. That is a simple fact. You’re marketing a SINGLE message to a group of people who you’ve calculated would be the MOST receptive to that message. And you’re doing that year after year after year. Eventually you’re going to have an effect.

And all of that is just to get this wonder drug just INTRODUCED. Imagine the compounding effect this would have after a generation.

Edit: source—please read if you can https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/
Okay I totally understand your disappointment with the doctors. But I just don’t think you get how powerful marketing really is. It’s not that they “fell for” the marketing. In true marketing—high quality, full fledged marketing—you’re essentially preying on and tricking the human mind to accept a message or idea. Literally on a fundamental level, to the point where the person doesn’t consciously know. On a subconscious level.

What we’re talking about here is big pharma introducing an idea to doctors. Those doctors say “my prescribing patterns haven’t been affected”. And yet, when you sit down and crunch the numbers, you see the numbers are rising.

When you throw billions of dollars and the nations greatest marketing minds at something, eventually you’re gonna see an effect.
Zero empathy. Go fuck yourself and eat shit.
Calling everyone idiots when in fact you're autistic.
580 million for a state with a population of 4 million. This isn't a slap on the wrist, it's a precedent. Stop being so whiny and take the win.
Not for long... though the stock did rally in after hours trading. Apparently the fine was expected to be much much higher.   Keep in mind this is only for year ONE of abatement for Oklahoma.  The judge left the door open for more.
So 3 billion for one state is not exactly folding money,.
\>Note that this does not mean that J&J has $337 billion in cash and assets

If J&J had $337 billion the company would be worth at least 10x as much.
Still, if every state made them pay on average 1B that’s a hit of almost a sixth of the companies entire market cap.  You better believe the execs will lose their shit.
No...  The articles of incorporation don't protect executives, they protect investors.  The executives can be charged if they commit a crime during their work.  The problem is that there's no law in place that makes this whole mess chargeable as a crime.  All anyone can due is file civil suits for damages.
Not while the corporations write the laws we won’t.
You'd just be raiding people's retirement at that point.  If you have a 401k, you are probably invested in J&J to some extent.  The owners of large public companies like this are everyone around you, not just the executives.  Would you want to be personally liable for companies breaking laws just because you invested some money in your 401k?
That’s absolutely ridiculous. Shame on people for upvoting this. If you remove the corporate veil and J&J folds due to these lawsuits then they would start seizing the assets of every private investor who held any amount of stock in J&J in the 21st century. Half of your parents would be losing their homes. Is the Reddit mob really this ignorant?
The board of directors? You mean the one comprised of CEOs and people who want to become CEOs? 😀
We could get free credit monitoring, though
Is that what happened with the tobacco awards?
and since Oklahoma's state legislature is one of those state legislatures captured by republican gerrymandering, that 'spending' will probably come in the form of tax cuts for the rich.
Agreed but $570MM seems too low in my opinion. This has been happening for twenty years. 

That $570MM was for the first year of the state's plan to remedy. It's going to take more than a year (obviously).
I guess if you don't have a valid complaint, you can just keep harping against an imaginary one.
THIS needs to be higher.
Yes I agree completely. What they are being marketed for is a pharmaceutical drug that they went to school to understand how these very drugs would affect patients pharmacologically. We are marketed to constantly in our lives and when we make bad decisions as a result of it we don’t turn around and blame the commercial for making us buy something. How long would it take a doctor to realize his patients were becoming addicted? How hard is it to do a simple search for people’s first hand accounts with the drugs?  Did they still not realize how addictive it was when their patients were withdrawing after only 2-3 weeks?
/u/Altephor1 is a bitch
580mil is nothing to a company worth 360bil.
I was trying to see if I could find a reason why the fine was less than expected, but nobody covered that, do you know why?
That's the real issue, all the actual decisions are so muddled by bureaucracy that any given individual apart from low-level managers telling people to do illegal things are insulated.

Realistically fines need to be based on how much the company *made* off of the illegal conduct, as in a multiple thereof.
you cuold charge it as involuntary manslaughter or something?
Exactly this. Take away the influence they having in passing laws of the first step.
I'd be in support of increased liability for large stakeholders, say, any entity that owns more than 5% of the market cap for a public firm. At this size, it's mostly professional investors who should have known better and whose job it is to know better. But the broader point is people need to do due diligence before investing, and that includes corporate governance. If they can't, then they shouldn't be in the stock market. The average retail investor should NOT be investing in individual stocks anyway. HFT firms, banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pensions have armies of PhDs scouring the market for edge; some rando retail investor is going to be better served by index funds/ETFs or even a 60-40 SPY/30Y treasury mix. Those who think they have alpha are free to play the market at their own legal and financial peril. When you contribute to a mess, you should be responsible for cleaning it up and making the situation whole again.
Bullshit, until the owners of capital pay for the costs of capital this is all a shell game. Limited liability companies are the biggest scam in human history and are responsible for most of the problems in this world.
Maybe they will use oxy as a settlement.
Implying any state government knows how to spend responsibly.
This wasn't just on J&J though.  They were only a minor player in it really.  The major players ended up settling out of court, probably for much less money.
"Probably not very guilty" in a case where they were found to be guilty. But sure, you're smarter than the courts and everyone else.
That 360 bil is not all from a single state or product. The reason related lawsuit from Okholmoa is probably not even a tenth of a tenth of that. J&J is massive and has many facets, not every facet was involved.

We dont sue you for your entire net worth because you wrecked little sussies dollhouse by mistake. We make you pay for the dollhouse and a little extra.
Oklahoma was trying to get 30 years worth of abatement/costs. Their expert valued that at $17 billion. The court looked at the evidence and the  expert’s methodology and determined that Oklahoma only really proved one year of the abatement/costs. So he awarded them the amount apportioned to the one year.
Article says the judge said the state's defense failed to prove that it would require more than one year of funding to reverse the opioid crisis. 

Essentially the ruling was "Yeah, you proved j&j broke the law sorta, but you can't prove it's even a big deal."
Where do you think those pension funds are investing? J&J has been a stable performing stock for a long time and the biggest owners are funds.
Free Oxy for everyone!  Oh wait...
there are few ways less responsible than tax cuts for rich people
No, but the courts and I are clearly far smarter than *you*.  

Keep flailing blindly against strawmen, even though it would be smarter to just take a deep breath and actually learn something that people are trying to teach you, and which, if you did learn, would make you seem like less of an uninformed old man screaming at clouds.

To clarify for people who do actually want to *understand* the scenario, Johnson and Johnson was *always* going to be found guilty if the prosecution's legal premise was upheld.  Anyone who has anything to do with opioids is currently a full-on pariah that's in open season for tarring and feathering.

People who understand context know there's a big difference between a drug store that filled 2 opioid prescriptions for terminal patients and a "pain management center" that was dishing out thousands of pills per "patient".  Unfortunately your binary white knighting fails to see or understand that kind of distinction.

Johnson and Johnson wasn't an opioid pusher.  They're a massive health company and just one slice of their activities did sell pharmaceuticals and an even tinier slice of that included opioids.  They didn't operate anything like how the Sacklers did.  JNJ, despite being huge and dominant, only supplied 1% of all opioids dispensed in the state of Oklahoma.  But don't let facts and context get in the way of your nice misguided rant against me for providing this information.
holy shit, so if all of the states involved managed to successfully sue for full abatement/costs for a similar timeframe, Johnson & Johnson might actually go under
Are you at all knowledgeable in the actual court case or are you just getting your information from regurgitated articles pushing whatever dumb ideas you're seemingly eating up? Go read what they were actually tried and found guilty of.

It has nothing to do with how much opioids they sold based on the market.

> No, but the courts and I are clearly far smarter than you

So wait, you're complaining about the courts not getting it right... then turn around and say that they're somehow smarter? Which is it? lol
Coming soon!  Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder made from pharmaceutical grade cocaine!
I'm sure they will get right on that following their asbestos baby powder settlement.
They’ll need a spoonlift to get rid of that thing!
>10-foot long, four-foot tall aluminum spoon

4 foot tall?! That dude beside it must be a fucking giant, someone call the NBA!
I remember receiving morphine in the hospital for extreme pain. Nurse injects it into the IV and this cold sensation creeps up my arm into my chest. Almost immediately the pain is melting away. I look at her and said "I can see why people get hooked on this shit" then fell asleep. Last time I ever messed with an opioid; liked the feeling too much.
Because there is so much confusion/misinformation here:

J&J originally developed the drug fentanyl for surgery. In doing so they were able to patent a process that allows you to grow poppy plants that are low in morphine and high in other opioids. At the time the FDA thought this was a good thing(less heroin) and gave them the right to sell the plants to other pharmaceutical companies under their guidance. One of those companies was Purdue Pharma. As a result they are being sued by states for being a part of the crisis. In court they claimed no responsibility as they didn't sell any out patient drugs and only did so under direct supervision of the FDA. The states claim they are complicit suppliers. Oklahoma ruled they had a part but awarded a minuscule fraction of the lawsuit as a result. 

They were definitely a part but I would list way down the list below: the pharma companies selling the drugs, the FDA, drug distributors and Doctors. The producers of Percocet, Oxycontin and Vicodin are all being sued into oblivion and states can't sue the government so JNJ is pretty much the only responsible party that can be sued. Doesn't hurt that JNJ is the 9th most valuable company in the world and by far the largest in Healthcare.

Edit: They also had some codeine sales via T3 in addition to Fentanyl.
As a recovering heroin addict "opioid spoon" sounds so silly to me.  It's a dope spoon lol.
That doesn't look like it weighs 800 pounds.
An opioid spoon, is just a spoon. Right?
You call THAT a knife?
Should have titled it The Dark Side of the Spoon.
My (heroin) spoon is too big!
Scrappers are probably drooling over 800 pounds of aluminium lmao
Johnson & Johnson: *"You know what would improve this image, if we got a Suge Knight look-alike to guard the spoon! Hey yeah lets do that!"*
"Pass the opioid spoon, please."

--No addicts that exist
I feel like this could've been bigger. I mean if they wheeled it there on a skateboard it's not a very big message. I feel like an 18 wheeler should've been involved at minimum. Probably driven through the wall of the building as well.
Cool.

Now it will get even harder for us chronic pain patients to get legitimate access to the medication we need to have a quality life.

Meanwhile the recreational users will still be able to score on the street.

Great Job!
I worked as a teacher and had BCBS insurance. I broke a disc in my neck and was constant, excruciating pain. X-rays collaborates my story. My primary care doctor of 6 years, ER doctors and specialist wouldn’t give me anything for pain. My PCD finally gave me a referral to see a pain specialist after 10 months. I was on bed rest and going to lose my insurance. I had to wait another 4 years to be approved for Disability and Medicare. Similar to gun control,The crackdown on opioids only affects law-abiding citizens. Big Pharma created the problem, the reaction and solution.
Thats a heroin spoon. Yes it's an opioid but I really hate this whole thing about pain killers being pure evil. Pain killer pills arent the same thing as shooting up in your arm. Some people rely on these to be able to function normally because of injuries. And now because of this massive fear mongering campaign people who actually need these things have been getting them taken away or reduced because doctors dont want to be labeled as drug dealers. Its really sad. The same could be said about alcohol but I don't see us making a big deal about alcohol killing people every day.  Or suing distilleries because they make a product that contributes to the hundreds if not thousands of DUI deaths daily in the US alone.
Where’s the middle ground between “all recreational drugs of abuse should be legal to reduce harm and treat addiction” and “pharmaceutical companies are responsible for addiction because they made opioids available”. 

Johnson&Johnson certainly were dishonest about risks vs benefits of long-term use. However, speaking as a new Dr, it can be really frustrating when a patient has serious pain and Advil and Tylenol just aren’t cutting it, and they ask for “something stronger”, yet we are constantly pressured to avoid prescribing opioids. Guess who will regret it when they become unavailable to anyone, or the prices skyrocket. I already see patients not given opioids post-surgery, even though they have the classic severe, short term pain that opioids are perfect for.  I’ve also seen patients get serious liver damage from taking 20 Tylenol a day because the pain was just driving them crazy.
 
The people who have sooo much trouble coming off of codeine or Percocet after just a few weeks of use, are generally ones who are misusing it to help their emotional problems, in the same way they could be misusing alcohol, weed, comfort food, or personal relationships. The medication itself isn’t the root of the problem.
I believe it that these people are using this opioid spoon to show that Johnson and Johnson has played a part in the American opioid crisis
Nice to see Jayz2cents is engaging in some wholesome protests
The latex gloves were a bonus touch. 

That security guard though....I know the whole time he was thinking about looking smooth as fuck. You can tell he ain’t about to look like a damn fool.
Would've probably been more appropriate to drop it at Bayer's headquarters, considering they literally invented heroin. But it's a poignant statement either way.
I may not know art when I see it, but I know what a giant middle finger looks like.
>Police asked him to move his protest to the public sidewalk and he did. 

Why? Why comply? 

Show up with the spoon, place it, don't give your name or stick around.
I was addicted to Percocet for 7 years after a spine injury. The drug company's pill kept me from severe pain and an even worse standard of living for 5 of those years. The last 2 were because I enjoyed the pills. The drug company didn't do anything to make that happen. It was my choice. I understand they try and sell products and have shareholders but there was a much bigger issue behind my use than drug salesmen . People have a responsibility too. There not enough blame on abusers and doctors.
J&J slangin' heroin now?
Tom Sizemore is going to need that back.
Somewhere, Paul Bunyon is strung out on a giant park bench, asleep with his hand in his pants.
I wish these protesters would realize the biggest cause of the opioid epidemic is the war in Afghanistan. We are forcing the Afghan farmers to grow opium and we're protecting the opium supply for Big Pharma
Since when does Johnson and Johnson make heroin?
I'm going to get slammed for this but there's a point somewhere between prescription opioids and shooting heroine where a personal decision occurs. I'm not saying that J&J don't have some culpability for knowingly selling an addicting product, but they didn't sell heroine. That spoon is symbolic of a switch to a drug that requires a conscious choice. It's a bad symbol for J&Js guilt in the matter.
I remember they did this back in 2018 also. The set it in front of Perdue pharma. They are the makers of OxyContin I’m pretty sure.
So, you cook pills on a spoon? This is stupid.
J&J sells spoons and heroin? I didn’t know that.
These are the kind of protestors I like
Yet again, the feel-good mob doesn't understand that the more they protest this stuff, the worse things get for people with chronic pain who legitimately need medicine; but continue to get hit with state mandated dose decreases, or flat out cut off from medicine altogether.

All it takes is one injury or a new illness to end up in pain management. Which, in 2019, should be terrifying to anyone.
I don't do heroin but I think that's too much. They should get a smaller spoon.
He did this at Purdue a year or two ago. I walked by his gallery earlier this week and it's closed :(

Biggest double take today on a post title

At a glance "protester drops 800 opioid spoons"
Ever since watching Chapelle's new stand up, Sticks and Stones, this entire thread is very sad and funny. Funny because of how right he is.
Can’t see that over the billions they make. Hell the Johnson family hasn’t had anything to do with the company in forever.
Would be nice to move homeless from the streets and set up a shelter near their HQ
Not all heroines wear capes.
That is one strong protester.  

What were they jacked up on?
Goes to show how naive I am. I always thought that the occasional curved spoon found in the streets wound up like that because it was cheap cutlery that got ran over.
Let's ban the Vapes 1st, you know... For kids.

It's a family company though
Now who's gonna drop an 800-lb contaminated water in bottle in front of Nestle's HQ?

Do they sell heroin? Either I don't get it or this guy doesn't.
We need to drop more 800 pound symbols of corporate greed in front of more corporate edifices
I know someone who works in a J&J wing in europe

Theres so much outrage affecting their share prices at the moment but theres not proper coverage

I believe the claims of asbestos in baby powder are so completely unfounded. Theyve had cases where theyve been handed fines (often with no evidence from their side) for baby powder links to cancer, which are not well-founded, and have succesfully appealed every single one with a third-party chemical analysis showing there is no asbestos in their baby powder, because pharmaceuticals are legitemately far too heavily regulated for any company to get away with that

Similarly, i don't think it's fair that theres all this protest directed at J&J. Almost every big pharmaceutical company produces opiate based painkillers. They all warn of addiction - at least here in europe, and you can't advertise prescription medication here. The real problem is that the US healthcare system works because doctors work privately. They all wanna charge an arm and a leg and they want you to recommend their treatment to your friends - so they look for the strongest drug they can reasonably give you so you feel more of an effect

Also, this is a heroin spoon. J&J don't sell heroin, and the fact is that in every branch of healthcare, opiates sometimes need to be prescribed. I've been prescribed small doses of codeine after dislocating my shoulder and luckily was never addicted. That said, i think it's unfair to put all the blame on JnJ, or any pharmaceutical company, for opiate addiction. Sometimes people need opiates. Sometimes people get addicted. I agree there needs to be much stronger support in place to avoid that, but realistically the main part of J&J isn't marketing, it's manufacture. It's not their fault if your dodgy doctor prescribes you too much, that's out of their hands at that point.
People become addicted to opioids then blame others for the addiction, I guess I should blame others for  all my problems I encounter in life.
Who the fuck calls it a opiod spoon?  Its a heroin or dope spoon.  And thats for the H, not the pills.
Ah yes, because i remember when i went straight to heroine after my meds ran out.... Fuck everyone involved with their political agenda that stops everyone as well as myself from being able to receive proper pain meds. And fuck everyone that cant handle their shit leading them to become junkies, which in turn prolongs/prohibits everyone who actually needs meds from getting them. Next person of reasonable value that says take some ibuprofen, im taking the bottle and ending this the pain for good fuck it. Fuck almost everyone and these companies, im out this bitch....
"J&J vice president, Ernie Knewitz said, "At the same time, we recognize that the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue and have deep sympathy for everyone affected".

While stuffing his pockets full of money. 

That artist has courage. I admire that.
My dad worked for Johnson and Johnson for a minute at one of their subsidiaries called vistacon. He’s one of the optometrists that helped create the acuvue 2 contact that made j and j billions upon billions of dollars. 

Right when he finished his r and d they sent him a pink slip and said his name would no longer be included in the list of scientists responsible for its creation.

Fuck Johnson and Johnson for so many reasons.
Also, maybe the artist should fucking help his brother with treatment? Giant spoons are cool for publicity, which is all this bullshit is, but, hey, if you’re brother is doing drugs, maybe, just maybe, use the money spent on your dumb art project on having your brother checked into a rehab and be a good brother to him.
Being Canadian and reading that I was like "New Brunswick?? This happened on the East Coast?  What is going on out there??"

New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Being a sheltered dweeb, I'd look at that and say "Oh cool, is that Robitussin or something? What a great art piece for a place that makes cold medicine!"
I don’t understand our legal system very well.  Can someone explain the consistency between a company being fined hundreds of millions of dollars and yet not one person being criminally prosecuted?  It doesn’t make sense to me
The outcome's tragic

Household dramatic

Livin' room for heatin' spoons

Basement's for addicts
Can we get some artist to drop a sculpture of a drone killing Afghan farmers, on the white House lawn please.
It is too late for that. 99% of people were cut off of the medication and they turned to street drugs. The street drugs are laced with some of the strongest opioids and are killing people. Then these addicts find those plugs and continue to buy it even though it killed buddy...

Unless you are old or have terminal cancer or some incurable disease that causes the outmost pain and nothing else is working (Last resort), opioids should only be used in a hospital setting and never prescribed.
As a healthcare provider, I’m so angry about this. We were told “OxyContin is a safe, non-addictive “ pain medication with a low chance for addiction when used properly. I comforted patients and told them it’d be ok. This drug was safe. Fuck Purdue.
I never thought I'd see the day when drug addicts would blame anyone and everyone else for their bad choices.

It already contains asbestos so it would be a toss up on which is worse.

That's just awful! What product and where can I buy it in bulk? I gotta get that off the streets!
I'd put them on my anus.

Uhhh where can I get it
That awkward moment when Johnson & Johnson baby powder is already in the news for giving some women cervical cancer due to asbestos or some silica variant.
Fun fact, cocaine is used as an anaesthetic for eye surgery
I agree that some execs aren’t going to see this spoon and think “this really makes me want to change the way this company operates”. But I also don’t think that’s the goal. 

Big art installations like this are meant to pull headlines and raise public awareness. Pressure from the public is the real play here.
I’m sorry their

why would they do that to baby powder
Talc. Not asbestos.
My grandmother continues to put talcum powder on her vagina after all these lawsuits and commercials. She says it’s fake news
More like "We need to drown the headlines of this bad PR and donate to rehabilitation." It works every time. J&J is not new to bad publicity.
Lol, right? I avoid them for completely different reasons. Most of them having to do with not giving a shit what they put in their health care products.
Honest question: is it safe nowadays to be around Johnson & Johnson baby powder? I'm a nurse and work around that shit all day. o_0

Calling bullshit on the 800 lb claim judging by the picture and it being aluminum.
Was my first thought as well.
[deleted]
It's probably not 800 pounds either.
Holy shit, I was prepared to make a joke about how heavy that spoon must've been, thinking they clearly meant the currency.
Why do news articles love exaggerating for activism? The Trump baby apparently tore down buildings with its lumbering mass, and overshadowed crops for decades with its sweltering, blubbering size, floating in the sky, devastating towns and farmers, starving the children and initiating an era of rats.
Oh it is so nice.
I hate the way opioids make me feel. They make me feel disconnected and fuzzy, like I'm piloting myself from a remote site with a bad connection, which is a horrible feeling IMO. But, I dont really deal with chronic pain, so I'm probably missing the appeal.
You're lucky it worked.  I was in the hospital with a perforated small intestine, and after 3 rounds of IV morphine, 6mg per round, over a span of a few hours, it knocked my pain back from a 9 to maybe a 6 or 7 at best.  Eventually they switched to oxycodone, and that was a bit better.
A lot of people actually don’t get addicted because of those effects. Over time, the body can’t do its normal processes without constant agonism of the opioid receptors. This is where opioid dependence occurs because patients can’t deal with the withdrawal symptoms and need their dose of opioids to treat the withdrawal. This dose won’t even treat the pain — they’re already tolerant to the medication, so the same dose will just treat withdrawal. They’ll need a higher dose to treat the pain. This is why opioid dependence is so scary.
Morphine gave me hives and made me feel extremely agitated and angry. =\
I was in the level 1 trauma ER with six broken bones and they'd been pumping all sorts of pain killers in me for hours. Literally in pain, in the ER, for three hours. Then they finally gave me morphine and just like you said.

The worst part is that it took so freaking long to give me that painkiller because of the politics. I should have had my pain reduced hours prior, but no I got to deal with that pain because some people don't know how to control themselves.
I have chronic pain issues. I take pain medicine regularly. Due to the opioid crisis I have to go to a pain specialist every other month.  I am given two prescriptions for the next two months.  They have dates that they are allowed to be filled.  My insurance will only cover 14 days so I have to get these pills without insurance. That’s a $35 copay every other month and $20 each month.  With my old insurance that paid for the whole month they were only $2.  I realize this stuff is addictive.  However, a lot of this is due to doctors not doing their due diligence.  When I took OxyContin after a spinal surgery my doctor only let me have it for a short tine. He then weened me off with Percocet and then weened me off of that. I’ve seen stories where people were prescribed OxyContin for simple things where the pain wouldn’t have been that bad. 

Anyway, the best pain medicine I’ve had was dilaudid injected in the hospital.  The hospital isn’t sent me home with tramadol, the most bullshit useless “pain” medicine their is.  She should have weened me off. I should have been sent home with hydrocodone or Percocet at least. I went through withdrawal from that dilaudid.  Apparently it makes you cry for no reason. It was weird. I didn’t even feel sad or anything. Just crying. 

Please remember there are people with real pain that need medicine and are being denied. If you are prescribed pain medicine take it for the pain it was prescribed for.  If it was given to you for your back don’t take it because your knee hurts.  This is the slippery slope. If Tylenol will cover your pain don’t take the opioid.

Edit:  This was longer than I intended. I just wanted to mention the glories of dilaudid.  Everything sinks and you aren’t nauseous.
It’s also important to note that not all people get hooked. As a nearly life long chronic pain patient who is told that I can expect to continue to rapidly deteriorate over the next decade it’s really frustrating with some of the misinformation.

It’s way more easy to become addicted to the high- that sensation you liked- if that’s all you want it for. If you actually need the pain killing aspect to keep working long term you only take what you need at minimum because the other option is basically making the drug stop working altogether by taking too much too often. Studies have shown less than 8% of pain patients using opioids under doctor care for non cancer chronic pain develop an addiction or begin to abuse. However it’s become really easy for various medical professionals to start denying actual pain patients their meds because it’s “doing something” where stopping people from taking illegal fentanyl from China is way to hard.

Now does the opiate industry have some blame for why so many people are into fentanyl and heroin these days? Sure, of course. But yoinking pain patients off their meds isn’t the way to help.

I actually have pre cancer of my esophagus at 32 because they replaced my meds with 2400 mg a day of ibuprofen. Now it’s Tylenol and medical weed. And contrary to popular belief weed isn’t all that great for all types of pain and for every person. 

Guess I’ll just die then.
Very true and it's sad this comment is going to be buried.
I'm gonna go smoke my "cannabis pipe" now. That's what my friends and I call it.
You’re right. This is a dope sculpture.
Came here to say the same thing. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anybody say they want to shoot up some opioid. The word opioid seems to be used only by people who are more interested in politics than helping junkies get clean.
I have 5+ years clean off heroin.

I typically just call it a "spoon."
Yeah it is pretty cool looking
I guess it's too avoid sounding like a coke spoon? Which is a different kinda spoon.
you guys want to intravenously inject  refined opium from the poppy plant species *Papaver somniferum*? I’ve got a brand new hypodermic injection device
800 pounds of aluminum is about 4.7 cubic feet. This seems about right.

edit: somewhat conveniently, 4.7 cubit feet is about the same volume as a 300 lb human, likely a bit more than the guy at the right of the image.
Metal is heavy as shit man.
I love reddit. OP makes a comment about what a thing looks like, and 4 layers of reply deeper nerds are doing napkin math to demonstrate that it *isn’t* 800lbs, when the article is perfectly clear on the matter in the first place.
It's solid metal, which is pretty much always deceptively heavier than it looks.
If it’s solid metal it does.
It COST 800 British Pounds to make it.  Headline is totally misleading.
Neither does an Opioid prescription.
It doesn't look 4' tall either.
It's bent like people do for cooking heroin.  Yes, they use a normal spoon, but the headline needs to keep it simple.
Wood and plastic are out
a grill is just a grill
Its bent to stand on its own without rocking
*There is no spoon*
I see you played knifey spoony before!
Already an album.
I'm high on three whole spoons of opioid!
It's a big spoon, alright? What's more important is getting a little spoon to go along with it.
they should have laid down a pad of fast dry hydraulic cement and then dropped it down onto that so you would have to basically jackhammer it apart.

It's solid aluminum so I mean they can only make it so big and still be able to drop it off in the middle of the night or whatever.

I suppose they could have JB welded it to the cement too, that would not have been all that fun to break apart either, but that would be a lot of J-B weld.
Seriously. This whole debate is full of fear mongering. No one gives a crap what the actual people who need to use it think, they're more concerned about the guy who's gonna like it so much they start buying bags of heroin. But they're also not gonna protest for better rehabs-- no let's just pick up all the medication. It's just a matter of time until the pendulum swings in the opposite direction. When peoples sick kids can't get decent pain care, then they'll bother to dig a little deeper. And the cycle continues
Yeah I’m not sure what is this person is trying to accomplish. They have essentially stopped prescribing opioids to people already. First they over prescribed, now they under prescribe. People are literally committing suicide because they are in chronic pain and get no help. We have to find a balance here.
Same worry here

Whatever it's not like I need to function so I can hold down a job to pay my bills 😭
As someone helping his mom trying to ween off of opioids using cannabis after she was cut off abruptly and has been made to jump through hoops to continue getting medicine, thank you for considering the patients.
this is a good counter argument to anybody who thinks these pain killers shouldn't exist.

If you find anyone like that, you can tell em
Pain management doctors are a thing. Think about it, they can be a great thing that help people with chronic issues. Or they can be a bad and lazy doctor that help fuel addiction by over prescribing strong and addictive opioids. Some companies may prefer the latter...
I don't understand why people are suing drug companies for making drugs that are useful. It's not made as a recreational drug. It's a drug that serves a function: to relieve pain. So what do severely burned patients do when they require dressing changes? Cancer patients? End of life patients in severe pain? How about if you leg was just blown off? I have nerve pain and I can barely walk, I can't imagine having cancer or losing a limb or having half my skin burned off. 

It's not the drugs, it is how people use them. There should be some personal responsibility too. If you feel you like the drug too much, stop. There will always be an addiction potential, and that's why you have to stop if you get euphoric. And no one else can monitor you for that except yourself.

Do we really want to punish drug companies for innovating and making drugs? What if there's a novel drug that's very useful but there's potential for harm, but the risk to benefit ratio is acceptable for them, healthcare professionals, WHO and FDA and they release the drug? But clearly most people don't want risks at all. What then? Should we have no drugs at all to help those who are in need?

Maybe question why it's so easy to get in America? Maybe question why people are asking for these instead of other addicting drugs? Maybe question the cultural differences which leads to Americans avoiding pain at all costs?
[deleted]
People are fucking terrible at accepting responsibility for their actions, so it's time to attack the thing.
Ya don’t say...
People don’t have responsibility about weed no?
They don't, but its easier to blame your problems on someone else than to take responsibility for your own dumbassery.
generally heroin addicts (especially within the current opioid crisis) start with pharmaceutical opioids and then graduate to heroin once their pill habit becomes too expensive. it's usually a little bit until they start taking heroin intravenously, though.
Yes there's a point when you go from a pharmacy to a street corner that is in your hands. If it's a problem, go to rehab instead. Go get help. People almost enable addicts by taking away their control "oh you're addicted you can't help it if you buy heroin". Addiction is an illness but you still have to deal with it properly
No shit! Who carries around an 800-lb spoon?
Should no company produce opiates? They were responsible for a tiny fraction of the opiate sales
Well first of all the optometrists don’t play a role in the development of the lens materials at all. They simply test the lenses in clinical trials on patients. So he wouldn’t be included on a list of scientists because optometrists aren’t scientists, they’re clinicians.
Maybe his help was negligible
Seeing as the brother has been addicted since he was 12, I'm pretty sure the artist has tried everything he can previously and failed because the artist can't stop, change or help the addiction. He can just watch as his brother slowly kills himself.
Why not both?
Governments like to take money.
It’s the American way, deny accountability and shift the blame.
By, 'the day,' did you mean every single day?
How does it feel to go through life with no sympathy, or empathy for other human beings?   I've always wondered what it was like to walk around with that much hate inside.
Many of these people became addicts because of how big pharma incentivizes doctors to prescripe heavy painkillers to patients when it's not neccesary, without informing them of the fact that these are painkillers that are super addictive when you simply use them as prescribed.  

They're just regular people who trusted their doctors.
Those bastards being....prescribed highly addictive opiates they never should have had. How dare they!
Did you know most opioid addictions started from people taking the prescribed doses of opioid like oxycontin given to them by practicing doctors (some of which were bribed to overprescribe opioids medications)? The only reason you would think that this is just random junkies doing drugs would be if you hadn't looked up the actual data and seen that the opioid epidemic was caused by the people who manufactured these drugs, not the people who trusted the pharmaceutical industry to help them. Yes, there are some people who are just junkies, but to call everyone involved in the opioid epidemic a junkie is just fucking irresponsible on your part.

The concern from the asbestos powder was that it could make its way into the fallopian tubes and cause irritation that could eventually lead to ovarian cancer. 

That probably doesn't apply if youre straight snorting it though.
Asbestos balls.  
I use baby powder to dry the bit between my balls and legs.  
Nothing worse than using Veet hair remover and getting that slime feeling when you sweat and wear tight clothes. Baby powder fixes that.  
  
I guess applying asbestos powder will only help towards my vasectomy and keep me kid free.
I’ll take the cocaine please
It's like a late term abortion...  In powder form!
They put the best in asbestos!
Oh damn...those poor women.
It's also used by Ear, Nose and Throat doctors for the same.  My late step-father was an ENT surgeon with his own practice.  He was able to buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for $10 oz, in the late 80's.  He developed a huge coke habit and had his license to practice suspended by the AMA (my mother contacted them, and they did an investigation).  He went to rehab, was under some type of probation for a year, and then they reinstated his license to practice medicine with a restriction that he was not allowed to perform surgeries (I guess he farmed that out).  I was an unaware kid.  I didn't know what was going on.  I just thought it was cool that my step dad was always excited about life!
and public pressure sometimes leads to government involvement. J&J execs were probably shitting over what happened to [Purdue Pharma](https://www.purduepharma.com)
More like “This really makes me want to change the way this company opiates”
Maybe they should put one in front of every doctor's office that prescribed these drugs and the medical schools that trained them and the hospital staff that decided that patient satisfaction was the primary goal of their hospitals.  Probably the lawyers that sue the hospitals should get one too as the hospitals were partially motivated in their decision to evaluate the docs that way based on the fact that patients with higher satisfaction rates are less likely to sue even if the medicine they received was bad.

There are a lot of people responsible for this mess.  Drug companies, for example, do not get to prescribe medication.
I had no idea J&J was guilty of pushing opiods until today. If reaching me and ignorant people like me with the info was their goal, the art succeeded!
Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $4.69 billion to 22 women and their families who had claimed that asbestos in the company’s talcum powder products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/johnson-johnson-talcum-powder.html
Talcum in its natural form can contain Asbestos: [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-28/is-it-safe-to-use-baby-powder/10630398). 

Apparently they stopped using talcum with asbestos in the 70's after everyone realized their wonder material was actually deadly. But exposure way back when could be causing issues, like slow painful death, now; hence the lawsuits.
because its cheaper than using other ingredients. 
if they can save one cent per bottle, that's an extra $100k for every million bottles sold.
Tbh if she's a grandmother it might be too late to make a difference now anyway
Why do people use the word "vagina" when they mean "crotch"? It's weird since you can't put stuff "on" your vagina so much as "in."
Factsabouttalc.com
This is a J&J website.
Believe what you will but it comes with links to independent studies from the FDA etc.
I dont see how it could be JUST J&J powder, it would be any product with talc having trace amounts of asbestos.
I feel like you meant to use the hashtag but instead got the big lettering. Now that is a \#kneeslapper

Thanks for explaining it.
800lb is doable. Volume is deceiving. Al is still heavy if youve handled 1 inch plates of it. 

Its like 3x as dense as ice.
I'd buy it. Aluminum is light but it's not that light. If it's solid it could definitely be 800lbs.
Well it's also not news...it's olds I saw an article on this back in May

https://fox61.com/2019/05/18/giant-spoon-sculpture-highlights-opioid-crisis/amp/
that's solid aluminum, it'll be pretty heavy. i work with aluminum all the time.
I mean, that much aluminum could probably weigh 800 lbs. It's not steel, but it's still fairly heavy
I had a bit trouble believe it to be 800 lbs [as well].

If it was solid aluminium I'd believe it though, but that seems awfully expensive and unnecessary to bother with going solid. I guess that's frequently not an issue with artists though. And it would seemingly save a lot of time of having to form the hollow structure instead.

Yeah same was a total drain I did not like it at all.
I have chronic pain and I have also had numerous surgeries and I fucking hate opioids/narcotics with a passion. I liked that I wasn't in pain, but I hated how I wasn't exactly *in control* of my body. I live in a constant state of pain and absolute exhaustion but fuck that.

You might be an "ultrametabolizer". There are mutations in the population in the gene that metabolizes opioids like morphine, some people naturally just don't have a reaction to the drug. Enzyme is CYP450 3A4. If have tried codiene cough syrup in the past and it didn't work also, this is why.

Irritability is a normal opiate reaction
Yea I had a vehicular accident open fracture elbow popped out and said hello. Thought I would get some morphine Nope naproxen for 24 hours until I was asked to rate my pain. Sure if me making eye contact with my bone that should be inside of me isn't at least an 8 I don't know what the hell this pain scale is.
Patients heal faster when their pain is controlled.
>some people don't know how to control themselves.

that's not how addiction works
This is the downside that is getting swept under the rug. Everyone is so busy talking about how addictive these painkillers can be, and how they can lead to all sorts of trouble if people arent careful, but these protestors and politicians arent in the ER begging and screaming for something to stop immense pain.

These companies arent innocent, and neither are the doctors that handed them out like candy to patients with pain issues, but we have to be careful to not go so far that people start suffering because opioids arent being prescribed.
I has an abscess in my mouth due to a failed root canal. The pain was hard to pinpoint and I thought it was a sinus infection, went to the ER because the pain had reached epic levels overnight. The docs there had no idea how to treat me so they gave me a script for 100 OxyContin and some Biaxin (for the infection). 
Well, after about 48 hours the pain was gone, and was then left with 97 oxys. 
I tried one when the pain was gone and oh god that was... unnerving. I get why people love it, you get to escape.. I don’t like that feeling of being a puppet in my own skin.
It's ridiculous, people ignored an excess of opiates until their loved ones got addicted-- then they overreact. Now they're not gonna care about the lack of opiates until their sick kids are in terrible pain-- I wonder who's fault it's going to be then. There's just so much ignorance and misinformation. 

Especially on reddit-- where people obviously just parrot lines they've heard other people say. I've seen like three different people say doctors still just hand them out like candy and they can't avoid them. When in reality it's been documented that at this point doctors are so scared to prescribe them that even chronic pain patients they have been taking them for years can't get proper treatment-- they're spewing the opposite of the truth. I'll be honest it pisses me off, can you tell? Lol
Yeah. Like I said JNJ's hands aren't clean. I just feel like they are taking the brunt along with Purdue(who 100% should) while the other 90% of players involved in the crisis aren't being blamed as they should, particularly the government just because they have sovereign immunity.
I thought those were only for use with tobacco products? I mean, that what the label says so it must be true.
Who uses a crack pipe for cannabis? Sheesh man
>likely a bit more than the guy at the right of the image.

Haha.  God damn, leave the poor man alone.
That's not 4.7 cubic feet.  Not to nitpick, but that's probably less than half that.

Cannibalcorpsium is brutally heavy.
It's aluminum though, one of the lighter metals.
>It COST 800 British Pounds to make it.  Headline is totally misleading.

Where are you getting that information from?
Why do they bend it like that? Also, how? (Assuming standard steel cutlery that can’t be easy).
There's a minimum crew
After the wording of that headline, I was expecting to see a giant spoon *made out of* 800 pounds of opioids.
And fries should be fries either way
If only reality weren't so complicated. Dude not all pain can be stopped with fresh air and frequent massages. Not to mention that crap is prohibitively expensive anyways. Im a chronic pain patient.. So tell me what you think the simple solution is to this problem as old as time?
[deleted]
please refer me to these doctors that hand them out like candy.  I've spent over 150k on alternative pain treatments since november of 2018 as well as most of my free time, and nothing has worked.  But no one will prescribe opioids, so stop with your bullshit narrative.
[deleted]
I have never been to a doctor who had handed them out like candy. You're repeating what people are telling you which is a lie. There might be some sketchy doctors doing it but 99% of doctors are not

Edit: people are absolutely protesting pain pills. Not sure why you think they're not.
Yes I heard about that town. And it got shut down like it should have. Care to show me other towns where that has happened?
We know doctors are handing them out like candy because a Reddit comment said doctors are handing them out like candy, which was sourced from someone else on Reddit saying doctors are handing them out like candy.

Honestly why do you people so casually copy-paste talking points and opinions you never came up with yourself? I might as well be conversing with a mindless robot.
It's true that pain pills were made popular in the US by pharma companies especially in the 2000s, but the current crisis is fueled by counterfeit pills pressed from Chinese fentanyls mixed with bulking agents. The pills are either pressed in China, in Mexico or in the US by drug dealers. But ultimately the fentanyl is coming from China.
opiate addiction literally changes how your brain works.  these people are no longer fully in control of themselves.
the only kid willing to raise his hand in class and answer the question that everyone knows lol
In other news, water is wet.
Weed, opioids, trans fat, sugar et all Whatever your choice is.
Have empathy from the chronic pain patients killing themselves now because they can't get basic pain care. They're the ones not willing to go to a corner pusher to deal with their issues, but they have to suffer just the same
Feels great. Probably not as great as shooting heroin but you gotta be pretty fucking stupid to do that.
Fucking a if it came in the big ass bottle body powder comes in I'd take 7 as well. 8 would kill me.
I think he means 5040.
No. 7! which is 5040
I’ll take 1 crack rock please.
7 pallets
5040 cocaines, please.
Interesting, I don't watch cable tv so I get to miss all that.
> that it could make its way into the fallopian tubes

I thought it was also an issue because of how fine it was and would get dispersed in the air and you can breathe it in. I haven't looked at it in a while so can't remember the particulars.
Haha, you should try goldbond as it adds a tingle and since it's still talc it may contain asbestos as well.
Dude. Use cornstarch. It's like silk.
Is that the baby smell?
That fact wasn't so fun
[removed]
What J&J did was shitty but isn't really comparable to what Purdue did. They sold 2% of the opioids distributed in Oklahoma.
It's a completely different situation though. J&J is in trouble for selling to Pharma companies that then created and marketed the drugs. We didn't go after the supplier of paper and tobacco when Big Tobacco was sued in the 1990s.
What government? Our good old government will just shrug. Doesn’t matter if everyone in this country walked out tomorrow for climate change. Old Donnie and Moscow Mitchie would laugh and laugh and not give a fuck.
The Sackler family just stashed 1 Billion dollars in Swiss banks, then they declared bankruptcy

. These people are no different than sociopathic killers, just better dressed.
They don't get to prescribe the medication themselves, but they sure as shit push HARD for those that do, to do so.
I feel like the whole patient satisfaction thing is a big part of the problem. Insurance companies and lawyers are a big factor in this whole patient satisfaction shit. Patient satisfaction scores are a “the customer is always right” type scenario in a terrible way.
It didn't help that some hospitals lost lawsuits for not providing "adequate pain management". If not giving people painkillers could result in a lawsuit it really changes policy. And it did change policy. 

In short it's a giant clusterfuck.
Lawyers should sue the fuck out of distilleries and anyone else that sells alcohol in their stores, and same with tobacco sales.  Alcohol kills more people annually than all illegal drugs combined, and tobacco kills way more people annually than alcohol.

Seems to me you just want to fuck over the sick and disabled, while not making any type of personal sacrifice to just enhancing your leisure time (whereas opioids actually help improve the quality of life for people suffering in severe pain and allows them to potentially work, or you know get out of bed and do SOMETHING).  Seems like you're either just ignorant or a hypocritical asshole.
Doctors shouldn't be afraid to prescribe any medication they feel is justified for the patient. Sometimes that includes opiates or benzos or many other addictive drugs. In 90% of cases if you just don't abuse your medication you won't get addicted. Yes, addiction is a disease, trust me I know this, but it's also a choice. One that's made every time you pick up your chosen substance. Responsibility can not be taken away from an addict. Not only for their own good but for the good of the medical industry.

Doctors need leeway to be able to do their job properly and it should only be other doctors that are allowed to dictate what their guidelines are or scrutinize their prescribing practices. Most politicians and cops are not qualified and shouldn't be the ones calling shots. This quota bullshit they've brought in might make the statistics look good but doesn't actually help most patients and has made many a life worse
The most ridiculous part about all of this, hands down, is the overwhelming fact that a company like Johnson & Johnson have it so absolutely fucking easy. They are literally sitting on a gold mine for life. What do I mean? I mean they are a company that sells fucking shampoo, soap, baby powder, birthday cards, etc. They will rake in billions for as long as people need this stuff, which as we can see, is for fucking eternity. And the craziest part of all is the fact that they could have had good, God-like PR for their entire existence. All they have to do is make their product bottles bright white, have cute soft newborn babies and their mommy's on commercials to advertise their products, and they are fucking golden. But no, they had to go sell death to their fucking consumers because that just wasn't good enough.
Any idea what the actual settlement will be? Certain states have capped damages at 2 million so the jury award is moot except for headline fodder (thanks GOP "tort reform" for yet another example of long out for corporations at the expense of citizens).
Crap. My friends and I would throw handfuls of *that* baby powder at each other as kids. Have no clue how much of that shit has gotten into my lungs
That makes no fucking sense that asbestos can cause ovarian cancer. Like yeah we don't want it with our talc but get real.
because people use the word vagina to refer to the entire structure surrounding the vagina. 

like calling your head a head despite the fact that there is a mouth, eyes, ears, nose, teeth, hair, etc..
Don’t tell me what I can and can’t put on my vagina!
You be correct, i know not what i do.
Absolutely. I think the general rule of thumb is if something is twice as large then it becomes eight times heavier. That can add up quick.
That's a different place it's at though?
Yeah people hear aluminum and think "light" when really they should think "light *for metal*." Aluminum is still 2.7x as dense as water and water is already pretty darn dense.
Congrats! That is something to be proud of, Keep at it!
I’ve been clean since 2003 but I shot a lot of heroin into my veins.

I’ve cooked black tar in a lot of spoons but I never saw a junkie bend one like that. They work just fine in their normal shape. If you have 18/10 stainless the burn spot on the bottom cleans right off.
Dilaudid *replaces the fuck* out of morphine. Morphine is basically like saline once you’ve had Dilaudid.

The first time I had Dilaudid I was in the ER from ongoing severe Crohn’s disease complications. My fever was over 104, my abdomen was in extreme pain, and they were prepping a room for me upstairs. The ER nurse puts the IV in and walks away. Comes back 10 mins later with a small syringe with some clear liquid in it. I assumed it was just a saline flush to keep the line open since they hadn’t hooked up a drip bag yet. She connects the syringe to my IV and pushes the liquid in. She says “Let me know if you need anything!” and closes the curtain. The instant that curtain closed it all hit me at once - it was like being stuck in an orgasm for the first minute, then just pure euphoria for the next 15 minutes, then I was just very relaxed for the next few hours with zero pain. Dilaudid is the absolute shit.

Edit: I want to clarify that I do not recommend using opiates recreationally. I’m just trying to describe the sheer power of this drug *when used responsibly* to manage pain. If you are ever given opiates for a medical reason, *please be blissfully aware of cravings to use the drug even when you don’t need it for pain, and take measures to counteract the addiction before it takes control of your life*. **Tell the prescribing doctor that you are experiencing symptoms of addiction.** It’s nothing to be embarrassed about and it is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength to do this. They’ll help figure out alternative medications to manage your pain and get you off opiods before the drugs kill you.
Like putting down a heavy suitcase you never knew you were carrying
One time I did something awful to my back to the point I could barely walk.  Someone gave me a pill that contained codeine.  OMG, I was itching from my head to my toes.  I couldn’t scratch all the places that itched and it drove me crazy.   Took a few hours to wear off.
10/10 , would rather have the back pain any day over that itching.
I had a very similar reaction when I was given Vicodin at 16 for my wisdom teeth removal. All 100 pounds of me couldn't even handle a quarter of the dose they recommended me. Fuck all of that, and high key fuck them too for giving a teenager a 2 week supply of Vicodin for something I did fine on Ibuprofin for.
I can’t take any narcotics without vomiting. Anesthesia makes me vomit as well. I’m terrified of being in a car accident because I can’t take pain medicine.
If only. My mother says the same thing you guys say. And yet, for me opiates were like being on a warm cloud. It was like setting down a 1,000 pound suitcase I never even knew I was carrying. Then after a few years of crippling addiction I finally straightened my life out. Still, you never truly forget what it feels like to set down the suitcase. Don't get me wrong, my life is amazing now and I am *genuinely* incredibly happy. But I know I'm always at risk. I know that if my mom dies or my girlfriend leaves, I have to be vigilant and know when I need support.
[deleted]
They usually start low to see how you handle it.  Last time I was in the hospital I needed a chest tube.  The morphine made me super nauseous and didn’t make a dent.
8 sounds about right. 

The pain scale is tough. Asking people to be objective about reading their pain on a scale most folks don’t understand doesn’t really work, but we rely on it. So many patients will tell you their pain is a 10, and when you explain that a 10 is pain so bad you can do nothing but scream or pass out, they will look you in the eye and say, “Yes. That’s the amount of pain I’m in.“

On the other side of the coin, some people can suffer an injury like you did, and do fine with naproxen and acetaminophen. It’s proper to try those first. But 24 hours of trial does sound a bit excessive.
That is infuriating. It's not like they didn't know you (and I) were seriously injured and in excruciating pain. Honestly after the first 48 hours I didn't need any more pain meds. I can't believe they kept you from having pain relief during the first 24 hours (i.e. the worst part).
Definitely not, pharma marketing (JnJ included) in general is wildly inappropriate. No one mentions Purdue (most Americans don't even know Purdue Pharma is a thing) took a settlement in the Oklahoma case because they knew they couldn't fight it. JnJ is holding it's ground that it acted within the law and with FDA oversight. 

And yet the physicians and dentists who prescribed opioids without examining their patients get off without a slap on the wrist.
Fml too real living in Texas
Honestly, I wasn't even trying to imply he was overweight. He's a security guard and looks to be mid 200s. That seems reasonable to me. I expect a security guard / bouncer to be the sort of person you could take a running charge at and get knocked on your ass without them even moving.
Assuming the dude is about 6' tall, the spoon unfolded is 16' or so.

At an average width of, say, 1' (a lot of the handle is less than this, but the spoon is more), it would have to average 3.5" thick to be 800 pounds.  Is it?  Eh, I don't know, but it's not *dramatically* off.

There's also the weight of whatever is in the spoon.

I doubt it's solid aluminum, though.
> Not to nitpick

Then why are you nitpicking?
its definitely not less than half of that
Yeah lemmium was going to be what is now moscovium
Ah, so like Staind and Korn.
what weighs more, 800 lbs of aluminum or 800 lbs of lead?
I WAS cracking a joke.
Easier to hold, but more importantly easier to set down on the table without spilling the contents.
Standard cutlery is extremely easy to bend
Cheap cutlery is often made of thin steel that bends easily.  They bend it like that so it makes a finger loop and is easier to hold they way they intend to use it.  Also the bowl of the spoon sits more flat so the stuff doesn't spill out.
And what might that be?
but this grill is not a home
Idk man. These pain doctors are so scared now. 20 year old men in particular are judged in such a way that it's nearly impossible to get a script
Nucynta was a miracle drug for me. One of the very few that actually helps me. Every doctor I talk to has never heard of it. I had heard a rumour it was gone.
[deleted]
Well that settles it, your personal experience trumps the various news and reports done on the matter.

> And now because of this massive fear mongering campaign people who actually need these things have been getting them taken away or reduced because doctors dont want to be labeled as drug dealers.  

I sympathise, although ultimately the (perhaps few) doctors and the many corps that flooded the market with pills and have created these incentives have made it both too easy for most to get these drugs, and because of that, generated a problem and backlash that now makes it harder/more stigmatised for those that really need it and have no other choice.
\[hand raised\] I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a *zoning issue.*
Is it though? Wouldn't the definition of something being wet, be that it would have some kind of moisture on or in it? Water is moisture therefor you can't wet it by adding more moisture.
Just do half of the 8th one!
A **desk** of cheese? Where the hell are you getting these units of measurement?!
Iirc that is a problem with industrial asbestos,  but wasn't the problem with it being in talcum powder. Im not 100 percent positive as its been quite awhile since i looked into it as well. Take it with a grain of salt.
Dont use the green gold bond, i thought itvwould bevrefreshing on a hot sweaty day but it just burnt my ballsack.
It is the talc that is the problem basically a k ik and of asbestos.
Yeah, but he actually cleaned himself up and died a sober and happy man.
I’m with ya. When are we starting cause this shit is ridiculous
WTF!  How dare you suggest such a thing.  Nothing is more important for a healthy society than fetishizing civility and respectful, most importantly legal, peaceful protest.  If change or justice cannot be achieved through those means, than it is obviously something that should not happen or is not worth it.  Has everyone forgotten that MLK, Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi all clearly condemned (they didn't) incivility or violating the rule of law... and most importantly stated (they didn't) that should all else fail violence was not an option.

^(giant /s because some ppl really believe this shit)
Waiting for the 2A crowd to wake up any day.
I 100% agree, and I fully support this sentiment.
If the public gets too vocal the company will make a sizable “donation” to the nearest police department a few hours before asking them to come break up the gathering.
Oh haven't you heard? You just *vote with your dollars*.

Because that totally works for completely necessary life-saving medications that you will die without.
Yeah you're totally right
And when that doesn't work, the government is supposed to shut down the internet and communications, and roll tanks into civilian zones to mow down the protesters and dissidents.


Oh wait, they're ***NOT*** supposed to do that? Well shit history, fooled me again.
It's been broken, meanwhile corporations are influencing them to give up their last line of defense.
of course it's comparable, it's just not the same magnitude.  A person who commits one murder is comparable to someone who commits 100 despite being different.
“A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.”
Sat outside my doctors office for a few hours during a glucose test, OMG the parade of supermodels coming and going. Pharmaceutical reps, every last one of them.
What the fuck are you talking about?
This is rediculous an really doesn't do justice to actual addictions. A opioid makes a person feel better often for a specific ailment. My they got it because they broke their shoulder. But hey, look at that, back pain's gone... Feeling warm, fuzzy, like you got the world's deepest hug...

And you kind of start realizing how unwell you feel. Your bones are healed, but your back? Maybe another one, there's 30 doses in the bottle after all...

Then, suddenly you start to feel bad without them. You're condition's no worse off, but you feel bad. You take another. The feeling's gone. It comes back, you take another to chase it away. It comes back quicker, you ward it off with two.

It's utterly insideous. Doctors should be comfortable to prescribe what they want. But the fact that drug company schmooze up to doctors with fancy lunches and little perks/bribes is an ass kissing practice that costs people their lives. My 95 lb mother got 60 oxycodine, after she crushed a disc in her neck. It was oxycontin, produced by Perdue pharm. The first one was enough to send her into hallucinatory fits and we had the rest of the prescription properly disposed of. The fact she did fine without it and it had such a dramatic effect on her is enough of a case of it's own that the drug is dangerous and that alternatives should be considered first.
>  In 90% of cases if you just don't abuse your medication you won't get addicted. Yes, addiction is a disease, trust me I know this, but it's also a choice.

This is the biggest pile of horse shit I’ve ever seen.

What’s the difference between a doctor prescribing a patient a dose of 2 30mg oxycontin per day for months, and a person without a prescription taking 2 30mg of oxycontin per day for months?

Both will end up addicted. Both will end up suffering physical withdrawals. Both will end up craving the medicine.

The only difference is one was prescribed by a doctor, and the other was probably just kicked off their prescription and is now buying off the streets. Not too many people choose addiction. Pills are fucking expensive off the streets. If you’re buying enough to sustain an addiction, you were probably already addicted before you started buying off the streets to begin with.
At least they saved a few cents
That's capitalism for ya. There's no such thing as enough profit, just more profit. Human life is a purely tertiary consideration.
It's not enough to make a lot of money, you have to make as much money as possible by any means necessary.
Yeah...

Couple things with that (1) the evidence of talcum in baby powder had been pretty shady. (2) does talc itself cause the cancer or is it cross contamination with asbestos and (3) although J&J has the largest share of talc, a single dose of asbestos from a contaminated batch from someone else could cause it. 

But yeah, fuck capitalism...../s
No clue and too lazy to investigate.
I quite liked it. The bold font really drove home the kneeslap.
[Okay kevin](https://youtu.be/_K-L9uhsBLM)
I think the big text makes a bolder statement
Ah okay, you're right.  Guess this dude just likes to leave his giant dope cooking spoon in random places
He's done this at several companies who are involved with opioids.
Appreciate it! Ain’t no thing now, just another day. But yea... it wasn’t exactly easy to get sober and I def started at “the bottom” ha. 100% sober since I quit, all substances. Thanks!

I’ve seen a lotta people die behind this shit tho. In my real life and professional life too. Reversed alotta overdosed but also sat with a lotta families while their son or daughter is in life support while they pull the plug.
I was actually thinking that too. It seems nifty. No use to me anymore though.
Ha yea.
Yeah, the couple of times I've been in the hospital with pain I always request Dilaudid (or something stronger than morphine). I have a history with opiates and morphine is basically like extra strength Tylenol. My wife was in a terrible motorcycle crash about three years ago and she had a Dilaudid drip for a month! She could redose every 10 min and though I don't remember what the doses were, they were fairly large. The crazy part is when the put her on the pump they make a big deal about telling you that only she is allowed to operate the pump. Then, the floor nurse comes in and basically says that we can do what we want but if she was me she would definitely be pushing that button while my wife was asleep. Her explanation was basically that if my wife sleeps for an extended period, all the medicine is going to leave her system and she's going to wake up in extreme pain. Then it will take forever to get enough medicine back in her to get her to a point where she's halfway comfortable. My wife and I decided that I'd definitely be pushing the button. She developed a pretty bad dependency while she was there and it was not comfortable for her at all getting her onto "normal" pain meds (e.g. Percocet).  Thankfully she got off of all of them after a few months. That was a really shitty time. Obviously, much worse for her but I took a leave of absence from work to care for her. Even after she left the hospital, she was still pretty much immobile for another two months.
Welp shit I'm sold. Brb guys gonna go get hooked on opiates
Dilaudid is *amazing*. I thank everything that I have a crazy capable will to drop things no problem because they gave me that when I had gallbladder surgery a couple years ago. It was fucking great. They hooked me up at first to help with the pain from the stones it was like I was floating, no cares in the world, and just super relaxed and chill. I had a drip and something like 4 doses at-will during a 4 hour period I could push a button to get through my IV. Super nice, and the opiates they gave me post-surgery and for at home (which, also, were fucking hardcore and nice while they lasted) didn't remotely touch that feeling though they were lovely. I remember the day I got released I figured "fuck it" and just used all 4 doses at once for one last trip. Worth it.
Dilauded hits so hard it’s *painful.* It’s literally painful, in the way a really hard orgasm is. It hurts your entire body as it goes in like you’re being hit with a truck. Incredible feeling.

Local anaesthetic should be the main source of pain relief for a chest drain. I can't say I've ever given morphine to someone having a drain inserted. Occasionally maybe a bit of midazolam for calming effect for a procedure but tackling the root of the problem (eg, blocking the nerve) is better than a systemically absorbed pain reliever that causes side effects.
My grandma did a knee replacement & rehab with only acetaminophen after they discharged her the day after her surgery.  Crazy ol lady could have amputated her own arm with a few shots of tequila to dull the pain.
Just had quint bypass open heart a week ago. First 3 days in ICU, I had a few bouts of 'can do nothing but writhe and yell owww, ohhh oww'. They didn't bother asking my pain on a scale those particular times bc it was understood I was at 10. Other times when i wasn't screaming without being able to communicate, I could tell them 8 and get the stronger meds. Pain scale Def works when you use it right but it is hard to be objective for sure. At least for level 10 it's pretty obv for everyone around you. I requested death a couple times. Post op open heart is no fuckin joke, esp as a 33yo male.
Oh, I figured, I juat didnt expect to see the poor door man get casually roasted as a chungus.
Probably aluminum zinc and whatever light scrap metals he could find
for real...
Nailed it.
Well done.
OOOH I know this one, it's trick question, because lead weighs more on your heart due to be poison.  

right?
Trick question, 800 lbs of GWAR! is heavier than everything else in existence!
That's right, it's 800 lbs of lead, because lead is heavier than aluminum!
Lead of course, it always has the lead.

Okay, im done and wont be here all week.

I don't think crack is an opiate though
Ok but how ya going to make it funny
I have 5+ years clean from heroin.

Spilling those "contents" after hustling all day to get it was probably one of the worst feelings I've ever felt, right next to heroin withdrawal.
Maybe I am just weak! I tried to bend a spoon after reading this and can’t get it to move at all.
Well one, I suppose
This is not the stove I know
Ice is water, and wet ice is wet water.
You must get invited to all kinds of parties
Correct. Water is just water it is not wet. When things get water on them they are wet. The water is not wet the thing water got on is wet.
Just a baby bump!
It's a problem with any asbestos that can become airborne, by nature all asbestos is fibrous and can cause lung disease, some uses of it are too compacted for that to happen. The natural asbestos found near talc deposits is definitely a concern and at least one of the cancer suits was from daycare workers who inhaled it much more often than the general pop.
Good to know as I am not into burning balls.
They are both magnesium silicates [Talc being Mg3Si4O10(OH)2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talc) and [asbestos being Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysotile). But they have very different crystals: [talc](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238130824/figure/fig6/AS:341348138930233@1458395146766/SEM-image-of-cationic-talc.png) vs [asbestos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Cavallo/publication/318295435/figure/fig4/AS:616480441901057@1523991799159/SEM-photomicrograph-of-chrysotile-fibre-bundles-and-fibrils.png). Asbestos in filiment in structure and talc isn't, and that structute is what makes it cause cancer (too pokey for cells to eat).  Its like grabbing a knife vs a spoon (similarly, you wouldn't call a knife a type of spoon). But much like knives and spoons, you buy it at the same store. When mining you can't really pull out one without at least a little of the other.
Yep honestly it's time to start eating the rich
I think this next election is gonna decide when we're gonna riot in the U.S.
It's time for guillotines
and it took exactly 14 minutes for some one to read the first line and go off on you.
Last I checked, the only one of those three who approved of violence was Mandela. 

They all approved of lawbreaking, however. I'm not sure any of them approved of incivility.
So you’re waiting for someone else to do it for you?
The 2A crowd is the most pacified of all.   They're just too stupid to realize it.
Is 2% a lot? Is it more than a reasonably prescribed amount?  Because opioids are really useful for things other than being addicted to them.
I know someone who has murdered 1 person when he was young and impressionable and stupid, and it haunts him every day of his life. I believe for someone to kill more than once is a huge difference
i'm pointing out that everyone here so angry over J&J selling opioids and wanting to sue them into oblivion and bitching about opiates are fucking hypocrites, and showing them exactly how ridiculous they sound
They do ignore A LOT of inconvenient externalities

I looked it up. This case happened in missouri, which caps punitive damages at just 400k. 

These women will be reimbursed for 1. Lost wages 2. All medical bills and then 3. Will get 400k prior to lawyers fees etc. And also provided j and j doesnt appeal. 

In other words these women got fucked. 

4.4 billion down to 400k plus expenses. I wish the headlines would tell ppl wtf is actually going on instead of feel good propoganda. Typically the jury members arent even aware their deciison gets immediately nullified.

Edit: lost wages are also capped at 700k.

Hey, here’s a question: How “bottom” was your bottom and how did you feel about the people who just gave up on you? 

My former favorite cousin (close as brothers, godfather of my daughter) is addicted. Been in rehab 5 separate times. Been narcanned 9x, and... I just don’t have it in me anymore. Dealing with the lies and the bullshit and what looks to me anyway, like a subpar effort to quit. The shit he has put his parents through... they’re in. Financial trouble now from paying for all these rehabs that shit shitbird has gone through. I’m just at the end of my rope with him. I’ve gone NC and while I’ll be sad, I’m fully expecting the call that he finally got one dose too many. 

I’m glad you got out of it. I hope you’re leading a happy and successful life, and I hope this kid will too, but either way, I’m beyond caring how it ends and brings relief to his family, just so long as it DOES end.
I’ve been lucky to be one of the fortunate ones. I tolerate opiates like a champ and have had zero withdrawal issues. When they gave me that first Dilaudid dose in my story I had been on Vicodin for the prior several months. After I was stabilized and discharged I was on Dilaudid orally for another few months until everything culminated in surgery. During one of my hospital stays I had IV Dilaudid *and* oral Vicodin. I had the Dilaudid pump post-op, like your wife. One day, they just came in and took it without warning and put me on Tylenol. In my mind I was like “Uhhhh I’ve been on a metric fuckton of opiates for the past 8 months straight, shouldn’t we be, like, weaning me off them?” I actually never had any withdrawal symptoms, just the worry and anxiety that I would.
Now imagine the withdrawal your wife went through. And then make it deadly to withdraw too fast. 

That’s alcohol. And we sell it everywhere so that it’s available to everyone 24/7. 

So many people die of alcohol withdrawal because they decide to get clean. But don’t know that you can’t immediately get clean. You need medical supervision to ensure you don’t have a seizure and die.

Opiate withdrawal I hear is brutal. But people need to know, so that we save lives. Alcohol withdrawal is worse than opiate withdrawal. People easily die when they try to get clean off alcohol (or benzos too) without supervision and help. 

If you know anyone who is an alcoholic. Just make sure they know, everyone. Please.
Be sure to post it on reddit for the karma.
Me too.   Checking online for Mexican Dilaudid.
Outside of a controlled and monitored environment, I'd almost never give someone more than 10mg as a single bolus. The biggest problem with IV morphine is that people don't realise how long it takes to work (30+ minutes). They give 5mg and then 10 minutes later the pain is still there and they give some more. That's nonsense, no wonder you think it's not enough. Even if you give fentanyl that's a good 5 minutes for it to take effect. If you really need something rapid acting try nitrous oxide / oxygen mix, or IV route alfentanil does the trick (with an experienced provider). 

With morphine 5 is usually enough, 10 is definitely not a tiny amount. I can't think of many occasions where someone would be in so much pain you need to give more than 10mg at once. If you're considering it you need to think about what else you can give or do (eg, paracetamol, non-steroidals, nerve block?, the whole shebang of multimodal analgesia), and indeed revisit what you think is causing the pain and have you made an accurate diagnosis, could you be missing something (eg, bowel ischaemia).

Ultimately you need to fix the problem causing the pain (whether it's a broken bone, bowel infection, etc) and if 10mg morphine isn't enough giving more in a short space of time is unlikely to help and will just cause more problems (eg, respiratory depression once it finally kicks in).

Ah, i was mistaken then. I dont think inhalation was the biggest concern though. After a quick bit of research, all the talk of mesothelioma was in reference to miners specifically while ovarian cancer was the focus in regards to use of the talc. Im sure if you breathed in comparable ammounts to the people mining it it could be a concern,  but the bigger concern for the average person was ovarian cancer.  I think neither of is really wrong.

It means something like 18 million opioid prescriptions for a population of less than 4 million, total.
Purdue lies to doctors about their own research. This isn’t about how successful or abused their drug was, this is about how they deceived the medical community and public to orchestrate a health crisis for profit.

oh the opioids? I don't know much about that other than they make them.

I meant overall that the lives they've destroyed earn them a spot worthy of comparison to Purdue.  The manufacture and sale of opioids isn't inherently evil.  Purdue's methods were the main problem.
the majority of that difference is that your example expresses deep regret, and your hypothetical killer does not.

In this case, both companies are the killer that has no remorse.  That's why they're comparable.  Your acquaintance would be like Toyota, that killed a hundred people by accident and demonstrated genuine remorse: a totally different situation.
[deleted]
Well I'm saying that you can't blame the pharmaceutical companies and not blame everyone else that goes along with it.  If you're going to start suing J&J and Perdue then you should be filing suit against all the doctors that prescribed that shit and all the hospitals that put pressure on their doctors to satisfy patients and on and on.

OR better yet, just quit doing it and don't sue anyone because we all, as a society, fucked that one up.
Those caps are ridiculous
"I was awarded $1000 and was given a dollar and told to pay for my legal team with that. Also I have cancer."
The punitive damages are capped, yes. But the "aggravating" charges are significantly higher than the punitive damages and will stand.
New guy take over Michael office. New guy from Cornell.
My older sister is now 3 years clean after a 10 year long on and off methamphetamine addiction.

Towards the end I bailed. Let my parents know that unless I asked, I didn’t want updates. I just couldn’t spend emotional energy on her any more. I told her that I’d visit her in rehab, but until then I wouldn’t ever spend a second in her presence. At that point she’d stolen from all of us, and lost custody of her daughter. 

She ended up in jail(after two months MIA with a warrant) then a long rehab stay. I drove three hours one way to spend thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her in rehab. Looking around that place, at all the other people who were waiting for family that never came, my heart broke. I’m so glad that I was able to see her when she was getting help. To help her navigate the legal issues she’d be facing when rehab was over.

The thing about treatment is that many of those people don’t have any outside support. They don’t get visitors, and they leave rehab with this wall of shit in front of them. How do you deal with legal ramifications, money owed, relationships destroyed, and stay sober?

My advice is to be there if he tries to help himself.  And if you have the chance to say anything to him while he’s still using, tell him that there is no point where he can’t fix himself and have a real life. That’s what struck me most - when I asked my sister how she could give up, and spend a summer with gross tweaked out dudes instead of seeing her daughter - she said that she truly felt like there was no coming back from the hole she’d dug.
Man, everyone has to look out for themselves. We can give as much as we can, and try to help, but if it is hurting you then you gotta do what ya gotta do. 

Our society is kinda messed up and set up the conditions that make giving up on people an option.
Yo UnclePepe I dont comment to people often. Your situation with your cousin reminds me of my situation with my best friend [formerly?].

He lost his Dad from cancer. He started oxycodone. Taking them, then snorting them, then smoking them. As someone who has had a history with abuse, I didn't judge, but also as someone who has long recovered from said addictions, I encouraged his quitting of it. I didn't want to be insensitive, given that I knew his reason for falling into it.

He ends up moving back in with his mom, quits relapses.... rinse and repeat. We still hung out often, and were great friends, but his addiction was impossible to hide. I started to be more vocal about my thoughts, and he distanced himself... he eventually asks if he can live with me, and I felt really uncomfortable considering the circumstances (I've tried to outline them above, but that's a paragraph....  this was years of my life). I declined, explaining the living situation wouldn't work (small apartment, low space, etc.), which was true, (this isnt a shittymorph) but the underlying reason was the lack of trust in his character.

We hung out a few more times. My wedding is coming up soon and about 8 months ago I invited him to be my groomsman and even play some of his music at my wedding (hes a gifted, albeit humble, singer guitarist, and electronic DJ). He accepted.

A mutual friend of ours told me he ended up moving in with him. To try and shorten up what is an unrequrested story, he stole several items from his home, and cash, for heroin and opiates (surprise for me too, apparently he escalated to main lining heroin). I haven't heard from him since. How do I approach this man. This was like, 5 or 6 months ago and i dont know what to do. Life isnt black and white. Hes an incredible person with a kind heart. Not some washed up junky like you might be picturing. I cant bring myself to initiate the communication. He did something horribly wrong. What if I agreed for him to live with me? Would he have stolen all of my money and belongings? I think yes? So what do we do. Addiction is a bitch. They didnt ask for this. We didnt ask for this.

There's no grand ending to this. I'm getting married in 40 days or whatever now. This is life man. Fuck opiates and heroin and addiction.

So, you're telling me that there were 900 million prescriptions for opioids filled for a population of 4 million (of which J&J had 2% or 18 million)? Forgive me, but that number seems rather impossibly high. 

Hell, that amount of actual pills seems rather high, never mind prescriptions.
It doesn't mean anything of the sort. There's no figure given for the amount of opioids prescribed in the post you're replying to. Which would make the value simply 2% of *x*; or 
.02x.

And honestly, just think about it. With your math every man, woman, and child in Oklahoma would each have four and a half opioid prescriptions of their own.
This is J&J we're talking about, though, isn't it? I'm familiar with Purdue.
I wasnt saying the guy before me was wrong, just adding an idea to the discussion
Yeah, imo theyre blatantly unconstitutional as well. The federal supreme court agreed once upon a time, but then Republicans/corporations started buying state supreme court seats and passing the caps on a state by state basis.

"Hot coffee" is an amazing documentary about the history and tactics that got us here.

I'm on long term opoids for pain and ive easily had at least 100 myself. just to put some perspective on it
Jeez. Yea I finally heard "the coma" story from my next door neighbor. From what it sounds like it was compounding health problems made worse by medication and a TON of opiates. She just sort of fell asleep one day, woke up 3 years later.

She knows how lucky she is to survive.
Nationally, in 2012 there were 81.3 prescriptions for opioids for every 100 people. In 2017 that number was down to 58.7 prescriptions per 100 people. 

However locally, some areas are much worse. In 2017, some counties had rates as high as 400 prescriptions per 100 people.

Dont know if you can in the US, but ive had some form of opoids on my prescription for at leaast 7 years. That adds up to at least 84 prescriptions with opoids on them. People like me do tend to fuzz the numbers

Wildly different images.
I'm on constant opiods for chronic pain. Have been on em for over a decade now. They don't allow refills on opiods, so every month I get a new prescription for 2 different medications. 

Reports talking about individual pills or amount of prescriptions written don't actually give actual accurate information.  My oxycodone is 120 pills a month, but without knowing the strength most assume it's overkill. 

Also prescriptions and Heroin use are not a 100% correlated issue. Using a Heroin spoon to protest against prescription opioids is just more fearmongering and won't help find a solution.  

Not directed at you above, just really sick and tired of people screwing over myself and other chronic  pain patients because the media is all about sensationalism instead of reporting the reality of a complex issue. The protesters only feed into the obfuscation of the issue.
This. I get 2 different scripts each month, a sh9rt acting and long acting, so just for me 24 per year. For years they were filled weekly rather than monthly, so 104 scripts per year for one person. If the patient attends a pain clinic, they are likely getting scripts filled once a month, but some places are every two weeks. If the patient is only seeing their primary care physician, probably weekly.
So OC has a faulty calculator...

Should you go to l'Hopital?
I had a friend awarded $4m in a wrongful death suit for her child's death. The presiding judge said that was too much and lowered it to $100k.  Doesn't seem right that they can do that.
" No reason was given for the reduction, which was disclosed in court records."  


If a Judge can't be bothered to even try and justify a decision such as this, then the decision should be nullified.  


"I'm the Judge and I say so" is not a valid reason.
To the surprise of absolutely no one. What is the point of jury decided damages if it’s going to cut by some crony judge down the line?

 Crazy Gideon is now a judge.
So there is actually a supreme court case which deals with excessive punitive damages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_of_North_America,_Inc._v._Gore

tl;dr: Guy buys new BMW from dealership. Guy finds out that it was actually damaged and repainted before purchase. Jury awards $4000 in compensatory damages (lost value of the car) and $4 million in punitive damages. Supreme Court says punitive damages are excessive, and reduces them to $50k.

Juries are often shit in determining punitive damages, especially when "mean, faceless" corporations are involved.
They fucking get away with everything.  Justice in the US is a sham bought by the rich both criminal and civil
For more context, a few months back when the jury awarded $8b in punitive damages, there was already an expectation from legal scholars that the damages awarded would be reduced based on SCOTUS precedent.

&#x200B;

Per [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-risperdal-verdict/jj-must-pay-8-billion-in-case-over-male-breast-growth-linked-to-risperdal-jury-idUSKBN1WN2HK):

>Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said  he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S.  Supreme Court decision which found that “few awards exceeding a  single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a  significant degree, will satisfy due process.”
It is fantastic at symptom relief in schizophrenia.  It's not for every patient,  but for severe PANS scores it's extremely effective.  Check prolactin regularly,  monitor for side effects.
8 billion was a ridiculous, unfair, amount.
C’mon, 8 billion was ridiculous.
Why would the plaintiff receive $8 **b**illion dollars for this?  Treatment to reverse gynecomastia exists and it occurs in some people normally.
I was on this drug for several years (just found out that u should have never been on it to begin with, but that is another gripe) the side effects are no joke, I was in a second med just to control potential side effects. They deserve a lot more than that.
Why'd that judge's back account grow by a million?
Risperdal (risperidone) also can induce a walloping seizure.
Small adjustment. Non story.

Edit: /s jeez you guys are dense.
Once again our broken justice system throws victims under the bus whilst protecting rich corporations.
Awwww... Those poor lawyers aren't going to get filthy rich after all.
Yes, well, $4m for a wrongful death seems kind-of reasonable.  $8 billion to one guy who unexpectedly grew breasts from taking a medication when, apparently, this risk was outlined on the label seems excessive.
Yeah! That sort of favouring the wealth and power is so out of character... next thing ya know America will go to war... with a huge power regime like Grenada.
I would put that 100k towards moral restitution. Balance it out a bit.
Unfortunately most of the time this is due to laws that specify a maximum payout in certain civil and or criminal cases :(.
Depends on the facts of a case.
I agree, but, I think the reasoning is computing lost earnings—-which seems fucked up.
Yeah, judge in unavailable. Car shopping at the moment....
It’s quite possible that’s what will happen. The PA Supreme Court recently upheld a 70 million dollar verdict in and ordered the trial court to impose punitive damages.

As the article mentions both sides indicated they would appeal the ruling, this case is far from over.
Can these decisions be appealed? It seems incredibly unjust, otherwise.
The reason being that they are a republican appointee that is wholey owned by the pharma industry.
Uh, yes it most certainly is. The judge hears  both sides and makes a decision, and then “I’m the judge and I say so is all that’s needed.
to make sure that 50k turns into 7mil
>What is the point of jury decided damages if it’s going to cut by some crony judge down the line?

So when the jury awards an insanely unreasonable amount for what actually happened the judge can knock it down to something within reason. 8 billion dollars to one person who experienced adverse side effects is a little rediculous.
[deleted]
But tax free?
Nah, I'm good. If the initial $8 billion didn't tip it off, Philadelphia is the most ridiculously plaintiff friendly venue in the country, maybe the world. There is a reason the suit was filed there, when it primarily involved a NJ corporation and a MD resident. Even after appeal they knew they'd get more money there than anywhere else.
I'll remember this.
No, no it's *really* not, unless the trial was in Zimbabwe or something.
After this win, class actions start though. Doesnt help that guy, but 6.8 million isnt an awful sum for growing breast tissue. There are limits on punitive damages. 

A roundup lawsuit just had the same thing happen. It causes cancer and the award was very high (billions), but got reduced.
Around three hours I think.
True but everything is in proportion.  The reduced award of 6.8M is really nothing to an enormous company like J&J. Consider how much $$ they made on this drug - aided but the fact that they were being deliberately deceptive for many years. J&J will make this $ back in no time. Drop in the bucket. 

In contrast, your local car dealership isn't pulling in those kinds of profits. A $6.8 M award would not only shut the business down but bankrupt the owner and his entire family for life!  J&J will still be here - forever. This is nothing for them. the %50K fine for the dealership is probably an okay slap on the wrist as a warning for their business although probably more $$ would have been better
It is called "punitive", it's meant to deter the company from persisting in their behavior, its size must be enough to make the business at hand unprofitable.
The point is a company willingly did not disclose crucial information knowing it would cause harm - so they are being punished by being forced to pay a fine, just like we do if we do something like drink and drive. 

Most normal circumstances the punishment is scaled to both fit the crime and provide actual punishment. $6.8 million, while a lot to us, is a whopping 0.085% of their profits for a year. To an average American, that's the equivalent of a $40 fine. We get proportionally harsher penalties for riding bikes on the sidewalks ($85 ticket in my city) or walking out of a baseball stadium with a beer in hand ($150 in my city) than Johnson and Johnson received for damaging someone's health and life...

Think about that - getting just a $40 fine for causing someone else's medical complications. This is why companies get away with such shit, because justice is never served or equally applied to them. It's not about what any plaintiff gets as a "reward" it's about the miniscule punishment given to the company that caused the problem to begin with.
I'm not commenting on this specific case.  But you're asking the wrong question.  It's not about what the plaintiff receives, it's what the negligent part should have to pay.   You having to pay $8 million would ruin you.  JNJ paying $8 million is meaningless to them.  Judgements are intended to be of a scale that motivates the offender to change the offending behavior, and to deter other offenders.
I know you are getting downvoted, but I do agree with your perspective that the amount rewarded is insane given how people have received much less for permanent disabilities, disfigurement, infertilities, and deaths . Gynecomastia is reversible, and I personally don't think the monetary reward fits the issue here.

This is not to say Johnson and Johnson shouldn't be left off the hook of consequences in general, but as far as I know, increased prolactin (which is the hormone that causes breast growth ) has been a well known side effect of anti-psychotic drugs for a while now. 

This is because the pathway that causes psychosis uses the same signaling molecule as the pathway that increases prolactin.
I was on it years and years ago - early 2000s I think.  I'm a woman and it made me lactate.  I had not had sex with a man in more than 10 years at that point so I definitely wasn't pregnant.   


It scared the shit out of me.  I went to an urgent care doctor immediately, convinced I had some kind of cancer or something.  The doctor was great, took a few hours to do some research, and figured out that one of the medicines I was on (Risperdal) raises prolactin levels and that I was probably fine.  That calmed me down enough to wait out the time until my regular doctor could see me.
Sarcasm doesn't translate well on the internet. There is no identifiable tone.
Yeah a 99% reduction is a tiny adjustment.
Billion to million..
But the judge is...
Yeah they are... Their bill is still gonna be exactly the same.
I dont want to make light of this man situation, obviously unintended side effects real suck

But for 8 Billion dollars, I'd let you total fuck my body up.

My whole family, nieces/nephews/cousins would never have to work another day
The problem is your legal system. In places like Canada, punitive damages aren't paid out to the claimant, they're paid out to the state, as a method not of rewarding the claimant, but punishing the defendant. The defendant still gets compensation, but not from punitive damages. 6.8m in this case is completely wrong, and absolutely reeks of a judge bought out by big business.
But these were punitive damages which are used to punish the defendant and deter others from the same. It's not an exact amount to remedy medical harm caused. 

But the truth is that J&J KNEW about all of these hideous adverse effects and said NOTHING for 5 years!! No one - the doctors or patients -- knew about this. These big pharma co execs and marketing people should be locked up
It was a 9 year old boy.
"The right honorable Judge Richie has determined this awarded sum should clearly be just the market value of a child, a larger sum is too punitive against the negligent corporation that has killed them"
Yes, both sides are appealing. 

J&J is appealing the verdict and the plaintiff is appealing the reduction of punitive damages.
You can appeal on basically any grounds. But you can be denied on many grounds. That's how the typical US court system is set up, I couldn't speak for particular quirks of individual states.
Pretty fucking weird J&J continually gets caught out for concealing negative side effects on their meds, right?
It's called punitive damages. Small awards don't deter a giant multinational like J&J.
You don't think 8 thousand million dollars is excessive in this case? They're also being sued by thousands of other people, not like they're getting away with much here.
Cash usually is.
If I got sued for that much, $800,000 would make me think twice about fucking up someone to make a buck. But $680?  That's a small investment to stay in the game.
Punitive sounds like something small to me. I expect punitive damage to be like 2 cents.
Increased prolactin (the hormone that promotes breast growth and can lead to gynecomastia)  has been a well known side effect of anti-psychotic drugs for a long time. This was known starting with the 1st generation anti-psychotic drugs, that were first developed in the 1950s.

This is because the pathway that causes psychosis uses the same signaling molecule as the pathway associated with prolactin, so it is difficult to control psychosis without affecting other neuro pathways.

Johnson and Johnson has done a lot of shady stuff for sure (ex: faulty vaginal mesh, hip implants, etc.) --But in this individual case, I can understand the above poster's questioning on why the reward was so high for a side-effect that is not only reversible but frankly long well known.
The case isn't about a crime, it's about damage to the plaintiff.   There are different burdens of proof for each. The plaintiff sustained a clinical condition that requires some surgery to remove.   They were not irreversibly harmed.   

It makes no sense to administer an $8b judgment for one instance, because other plaintiffs may also want to receive compensation.  This isn't a class-action case.  The punishment is 0.085% x (number of plaintiffs) and it doesn't make sense for one to receive the bulk of the payment.
Well said. Yes, big pharma cos would rather take the risk of getting sued than disclose the most hideous adverse side effects of their drugs and risk losing money for the first years when the drug hits the market.

They can go on w/ their secret for years, making a shitload of $$ and then if they get caught, a $6M penalty is really not a big deal. The lies were worth it. And maybe the CEO can contribute some of his $33M annual salary to pay off the fines. The co will make that money back within a year anyway as they market all of their drugs for off-label, non-approved bullshit uses, promoting these drugs for weight loss, clearer skin, headaches, nausea, etc etc
It was reduced from 8 **B**illion, not million. Eight Billion is an insane amount of money to be paid to one person, especially since this case is about the plaintiff developing gynecomastia. It sucks, but a simple surgery can easily fix the problem, this wasn't a life altering condition.
Yeah, I will say I could live with the lactation because the raised prolactin levels kept me without a period for six years. Though the weight gain and binge eating was a pain. I'm glad that I changed shrinks a while ago. She had water I me off of it since she met me. I explained what got me on it during a visit and she told me that it was a misdiagnosis and got me of it. It's been a month and I feel so much better
It seems as though some folk are unaware of [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) and that the sarcastic tone of voice they used in their own inner monologue isn't readily apparent to someone reading their comments.
Judges don't get paid by the case.
Cases like this are not charged by the hour.   They are getting a percentage of the winnings.  Probably close to 40%.
For 8 billion I'd let you titty fuck my new breasts.
I'd even do it for 6.8 million: get breasts, have them surgically removed, and deal with some unsightly scars and some weird hormone imbalances, I'm sure.  He already also won more than half a million for corrective damages, so I assume that was for surgeries, etc.
True. For 8 billion they can destroy your body and to fix it you'll still have 7.9 billion.
I applaud your system for awarding punitive damages to  the state. I've often thought that awarding punitive damages to the claimant was wrong.
While I agree that the doctors and patients appear to not have been informed of the side effects, J and J claim that those warnings were in their documentation.  In my experience, the have a list of side effects and likelihoods in their documentation and I always read that thoroughly (pharmacist also has that responsibility).  If that warning was in there, I think that is a huge mitigation.  However, if their reps were pushing this medication with awful side effects for off label use to calm an autism difficulties, it seems like this is definitely a case of the solution being far worse than the cure, and they need to take responsibility for that.

As far as punitive damages go, they are getting sued by many other families with serious issues, and if this was the only punitive case, I would say the 8 billion number makes sense to cover payouts for the people involved.
Yes, he was 9 when he started taking the medication.  Not sure when the breasts showed up.
Okay, so what? He deserves some compensation, but getting titties doesn't deserve more money than dying or having a horrible disease.
It’s a bit crass, but it does come down to things like life expectancy, lost wages, pain and suffering, etc. 100k seems a bit light for a child wrongful death, but we don’t know the facts of the case.
They make products used by literally a billion people. I bet they get sued 20 to 30 times, every day, forever.
Not at all - they should be sued for even more than that. What they did was deliberate and they have been doing this w/ other drugs as well for years and years. They do it b/c for them, it is financially worth it to hide the adverse side effects from the public and make shitloads of $$ from the drug for years and if they have to pay a large fine from a lawsuit later, its okay b/c they have already made so much $$$$.

J&J can earn back that $$ within a year
That's not how the English language works.
Because you _have_ to disclose that information, hence why if you read the article you'd see Johnson and Johnson are facing thousands of other lawsuits.
Some of what you say is true. However judgements like this have different components besides just "what is the raw wholesale cost of a surgery to fix the problem plus the victim's lost wages".  That's in there certainly, but it's not the punitive or preventive component.  The punitive part is "how do we get a rich bully to change their conduct"?  And until we have laws that say we can throw the CEO and board members in prison, the alternative how much can we hit their finances to make them think twice before doing it again.
I'**m** we**l**l awa**r**e. My mes**s**age is clear that the **m**illions or **b**illions aren't the price tag for a surgery, they're punitive.
He's implying bribes or private sector "job"
Hello, I'm a billionaire. Would you like to be my friend?
The plaintiff puts up the risk, capital, time and effort.  They should be compensated before the rest of the money is dumped into the government's void.
>" J and J claim that those warnings were in their documentation." --  
>  
>There have been SO many of these lawsuits against big pharma companies - especially related to antipsychotics. Almost ALL of these big pharma companies - such as AstraZeneca - have been found to have outright lied about the adverse effects or minimized them. The court documents have explicity show corporate emails that back that up.

These pharma companies are willing to take the risk of lying to make a profit because even the typical financial penalties are nothing compared to the profits they bring in by lying. It is despicable and I hope more pharma companies get slammed with even larger fines.
Just pointing out he had no ability to properly weigh any possible pros/cons.  The adults around him, particularly J&J, failed him.  I’m not making an analysis of what appropriate compensation would be - merely reiterating that aforementioned fact.
But this type of award is more about making a statement and saying what J&J did was flat out wrong and F-ud up and warning other companies that they could be next if they don't get their sh\*t together.

So, the payout is not an exact figure based on any medical procedures that will need to be done in the future or medical bills but simply a punishment amount based on what kind of a-holes J&J is.
The point is not simply to provide restitution to victim but discourage companies from allowing it to happen again, it why executives and majority shareholder should be personally liable for the actions of the company they run/own.
Lol well 8 billion is half of their net income so I guess the other 17 thousand people suing them should go fuck themselves right
Because you _have_ to disclose that information, hence why if you read the article you'd see Johnson and Johnson are facing thousands of other lawsuits.

e: it's also a punitive damages award. So specifically meant to punish the defendant, not 'award' the plaintiff.
That information is clearly disclosed on the label, so these lawsuits must be about something else.

https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/020272s056,020588s044,021346s033,021444s03lbl.pdf

Search for “gynecomastia”.

Edit: one possibility is that it was not disclosed earlier - that label is from 2009. Or maybe data was manipulated to show the risk as lower than it actually was.
What are you even talking about?   There will never be a law where you can incarcerate someone over a civil tort case, and there are already laws where people can be arrested for harming someone.    You have an idiotic and childish "corporations = bad" thought process and are neglecting the fundamental realities of how drug discovery works in America.   Risperdal (and all atypical antipsychotics) is a useful drug where the benefits vastly outweigh the side effects for the overwhelming majority of patients.   It is not possible to formulate it so this side effect doesn't happen, and even if it does, it's not that bad.   The society you describe is one where nobody would ever bother trying to develop new drugs because of your idiotic and disproportionate punitive damages.   People don't want to live in a world where liability paralyzes anyone from doing anything, because most large projects have some risk of harm in addition to the benefits they provide.
He needs to imply harder.
Depends on the currency...

Billionaire USD... maybe.

Billionaire Iranian Rial or Venezuelan Bolívar?  Not as much.
Yeah,  if they were not acting in good faith then I completely agree that those damages need to be high, but also think that the highest up people involved need to see some jail time.
If it’s a typical negligence case, punitive damages don’t usually apply. That requires something more, like recklessness or intentional conduct.
These are punitive damages - they are not meant to be a financial reimbursement for any medical or psychological damages. Punitive damages are only used in cases where the judge wants to make a statement that the defendant's behavior was egergiously inappropriate and they need to be punished for it.  In other words, the sky is the limit.  Sort of like when a local county judge gives a low level, first-time offender a 15 -year sentence just to prove a point.

In any case, J&J should have thought about this before they deceived the public - deliberately - for five years. They have been doing this shit for decades. It's about G-D time they got hit hard.
I never said that.  But good cloud rant.
So wrong on so many levels. There was clear evidence that J&J knew about these hideous, adverse side effects of the drug for AT LEAST 5 years before they decided to put some type of vague warning on the label? You don' think that is criminal behavior? 

This was deliberate, systematic deception. How could the patients and doctors know the real truth if it was never given? Also, J&J was promoting this drug for non-approved uses. They were promoting it as a wonder drug to help with bullshit things like sleep disorders and headaches etc. They are putting people at risk of various hideous side effects including tardive dyskinesia so they can sleep better?

News for you: My Doctor put me on Risperdal soon after the drug came out. Little was known about it and J&J purposely suppressed clinical trial data that showed that the risk of tardive dyskinesia was quite a bit higher than they noted in their marketing materials. I now have tardive dyskinesia thanks to that fucking drug even though I wasn't on it for very long. This is a permanent, non-reversible movement disorder!! I was put on the drug b/c a had persistent clinical depression related to bipolar II (the lesser version of BP). I was highly functioning - a good job, spouse, home etc and very manageable bipolar disorder. I did not need this drug as I am not schizophrenic nor a threat to myself or others. I have been off it for man years now and I do not need it. It caused me more harm than good.

EVERY SINGLE neurologist I have been to agrees that Doctors should NEVER be taking the extreme risk of putting people on these types of drugs unless it is absolutely necessary. It should be a very last resort unless they have a severe case of schizophrenia and are dangerous to others or themselves. Instead, drug reps and doctors give this shit out like candy and make it seem like it is no big deal.

Seroquel is also being promoted heavily - off label (not FDA approved) - as a sleep drug. The drug reps are pushing it and the Dr.s are prescribing it like crazy.

Read through the transcripts of the seroqule class action lawsuit and how the director of marketing at AstraZeneca told colleagues to use "lots of smoke and mirrors" to hide the truth about all of the toxic side effects. Same shit w/ this case,

Lastly, big pharma cos make shitloads of $$ w/ their deceptive marketing and they expect these lawsuits. They don't care. They would rather lie and make tons of $ and then the fine is just a drop in the bucket. Or maybe the CEO can pay some of it from his undeserved $33M salary. He and the rest should be in jail.
You need to not be an idiot harder.
This user titty fucks
Gotta love getting downvoted for using facts on Reddit
[deleted]
You need to grow up harder.
That’s why I said in a typical negligence case. There seems to be a basis for punitives here.
I agree you are a fucking moron that can't read in between the lines, are you autistic? If so my apologies.
You used a shit ton of words to ridicule me by saying "Sorry you're so stupid".  Are you still in college?
We call all assume middle school was the furthest you got. Also trying to use being in college as an insult, LOL. "You are so dumb you went to college"
I don’t understand how there is a huge blowback on the vape pens but a product that is bought in grocery stores nationwide and is used on newborns all the way to the elderly has barely any news time?

Let’s keep acting like our government really cares about our wellbeing tho...
"I'm not recalling it because *I* think it's unsafe. I'm recalling it because *You* think it's unsafe. That makes you the problem."
Of course every high-up knew. But as long as there's never any real, proportional punishment for them, it's advantageous (profitable) to give it a shot, and they have nothing to lose when it doesn't work.
Corporations operate like sociopaths with the singular function of generating money. I say this in a non-judgmental way, that’s what they’re designed to do. Generate money above all other considerations. 

I’m fine with their existence. But I don’t understand anyone who thinks companies like this shouldn’t be subject to fierce regulation and accountability when absolute horseshit like this takes place. I don’t expect a money making robot (or anyone who runs one) to have a conscience, but for fuck’s sake can we please subject them to at least a few rules?
Johnson & Johnson sells baby powder now? I thought they only sold asbestos.
Johnson & Johnson - No more Tears.....Cause you’re Dead!!
Welcome to corporate America circa the last 25 years. All the MBA Wharton types follow this same philosophy (Boeing).
They recalled a single lot of 33,000 bottles for a sub-trace amount (<0.00002%) of asbestos. . .however:


They cannot confirm if cross-contamination of the sample caused a false positive.


They cannot confirm whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the sample was prepared in a controlled environment.


They cannot confirm whether the tested product is authentic or counterfeit.


The recalled the lot just as a precaution and to act in good faith while the report is investigated.

What do CEO's do besides fire people and lie about shit?
[deleted]
So, for someone like me who used that shit without knowing, what should I do exactly? 

I am pregnant now (12w) — how will that affect me or my baby? Anyone have any resources I can follow up with?
Until these people have their companies stripped down and sold for parts and spend a few years in prison, nothing will ever change.
I am sure there will not be any PR or J&J shills in this thread. 

/s


EDIT: and already we have at least 5 shadow banned comments.
And just what happens if he'd lie about the safety of the product to protect his own $ interests?   Oh yeah, nothing much.  :P
First the opioids and now this

Get ready for more Johnson & Johnson ads trying to remind us of the good old times
How does baby powder get contaminated with asbestos? Is it some kind of by-product of manufacturing?
Glad I don't use this shit on my kids.
"FDA bombshell" 
Don't assume the FDA is honest, competent or above politics. Don't assume they are not being manipulated by crooked tort lawyers. Don't assume they are not shilling for a Congress looking to shake down companies for cash.
Was there any actual proof? I’m honestly asking. I’m just wondering if it’s correlation and not causation.
gotta protect shareholder value at all costs!
A single report from the FDA means close to nothing - it's anything BUT a bombshell. OBVIOUSLY it does not prove decades of deaths from exposing babies to asbestos. That is, however, the opening salvo of the story tort lawyers will promote to ramp up another class action ripoff based on junk science.

No? Consider: 
Toyota runaway acceleration hogwash some years ago, pumped by tort lawyers as corporate murder, all told cost Toyota something like $3 billion. The chances of having a runaway event when you drove a Toyota were 1.7 in 100,000,000,000,000,000. 

The IKEA dresser that was accused of killing little children in tipover accidents made millions for the legal firm that promoted the class action.. 
Reality: an owner of the dresser would have to wait on average 123 million years before a child was killed.

Now: Oh my God - babies inhaling asbestos! 

How many law firms have already filed... 
They are relying on using YOUR ignorance to get rich in a ripoff.
You know what would stop this kind of bullshit? Fine companies for the the total amount of escaped product that is bad.  Companies will be allowed to self report this, however, if there is product that is not reported, the fine will be triple for all product that remains.  This, of course, is added above any other fines that would be levied against the company for negligence.  No more of that "sales outweighs the risk so we don't issue a recall bullshit from Fight Club.
It’s almost like limited liability corporations are a bad thing.
/r/iamatotalpieceofshit
He lied. Anyone surprised?
It’s makes me angry seeing all these J&J commercials making it seem like they are angels and doing the right thing. I know it’s a campaign to save face but still. It’s insulting to those who aren’t fucking stupid.
Take every single executives money and assets and put them in jail for life.
Shit I used to get drunk and slap that stuff all up on my nuts back in college.  This was 20 years ago, should I be worried?
These companies are willing to fuck with children now because they know there isn’t any consequences. These companies are willing to fuck with innocent newborns because that’s just how much they care about making a few hundred million dollars. I’d like to see one of these top decision makers explain their decision to an angry parent. Oh wait, they’ll never have too.
Wonder if any workers have sought to bring lawsuit for exposure to asbestos?

Wonder if any former employees died of mesothelioma?
This mfer gets caught knowingly peddling cancer to babies and nothing will happen to him. Meanwhile mainstream media is in a tizzy about jail sentences for a couple actresses who helped their kids get into college; definitely unacceptable but in comparison, this is justice?
and yet nothing will happen to him.......
Has anybody going to jail because of this? 

Start sending to jail high directives of companies, make them be held accountable, and we will see changes in their behavior.
My family used Corn Starch for years instead anyways.
*Shares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost* ***6%*** *on Friday after the recall was announced.*

What a boring dystopia...
Well of course he did
This stuff is taken from a mine. Duh
Who the hell is buying talcum powder?  The cornstarch is just as good.
Johnson and Johnson; a family murdering company.
Didn't learn the right lessons from the Tobacco Company Execs that testified.
Basically the problem is asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that can sometimes be found in talc deposits.
“Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.”


If this is true, ask him if any of his immediate family members used his products on their babies. Ask if he used his own baby powder on his children.
How did the asbestos get into the powder? Seems like a major blunder from the company. Who's responsible?
The first step in cases like this should be to dissolve the board. Fire the CEO. No severance.

The next step should be to release all operations and profits to the federal government. The business shall continue operations and after overhead costs and employee wages, all further profits are allocated to education, social, and infrastructure programs.

Finally, a separate department provides oversight so the company can never again provide intentionally dangerous goods or services to the public. 

This process could be applied to any aggressively negligent corporation, such as the pharma companies, oil, insurance, even utilities like PG&E.

 But that's just my crazy opinion.
I'm so glad someone warned me about baby powder back in 1997.
Fucking piece of shit. My sister in law would forgive him, yet I would prefer that he be sentenced to life in solitary confinement. American greed is a fucked up thing.
Fine them. 

Take 2019 profit margins, multiply by 4, and then fine them into chapter 7 and allow the free market to offer us a different conglomerate that can do the right thing.

Pretty simple solution to a non-complex issue.
Johnson & Johnson AGAIN?

How many shitty things have they been caught doing in the last couple years?
Give people cancer. Get killed
charge him with perjury at a minimum
greedy corporate slimeball

this guy can't be concerned with the millions of people affected

he's got to get another yacht!
So you get raised with your parents using this shit on your ass and your kids/grand kids (standard powder everyone used on infants for decades) and now what? Your dick falls off and oh well?
So.. . Are they ADDING asbestos? Is it somehow a bi- product of manufacturing? How exactly dogs it get in there?
Perfectly safe if you're not snorting it like the last 10 minutes of Scarface.
This is all just a big ad for baby powder. I’m going go pick some up.
They just came out and said virtually all baby cereals have heavy metals contamination too so lols on us I guess
Because cigarette companies profit from vapes being banned. Who profits from this?
I’m just wondering what I can use on my balls as an alternative
I’ll try to explain it. J&J donates more money and well that’s it.
That's not entirely the fault of the government though. People in general WANTED to attack vaping. Remember how jokes and what not started a while ago of vapers being jerks? And most of it came out of thin air. Right. The same kinds of people who hate that poor people aren't dead latched onto hatred for vaping and bang.

So the vape ban was a build up. This is different because no one wants to hate baby powder.
The simple fact is that talc and asbestos occur naturally together, and can become contaminated with chrysotile asbestos. (this is the type that can cause cancers).

In 1973, the FDA developed new standards and tests that would ensure that the talcum powder you buy in stores was asbestos free.

Most of the lawsuits are from repeated and continuous use of product before or immediately after the FDA implemented these standards. Which is understandable as there was probably large lots of contaminated products already in people's homes, stores, and warehouses at this time. 

J&J can and have been found liable for cases where their product causes/caused cancer. That is a given, but it doesn't necessarily mean they did anything malicious. It is just like how you could sue me after getting hurt on my property after breaking and entering. I could and may be liable for not ensuring you couldn't enter my property and for not clearing any hazzards.

So, I would bet that any talcum powder produced in the past 20 years is safe, especially from a large company such as J&J. I would be less certain about products from other countries or smaller companies that may not have such standards or stringent testing.

Read my other post in this thread for more about the current recall/situation. . .short explanation, it was just a precautionary and good faith recall while J&J and the FDA investigated the positive test that revealed sub-trace amount (wickedly small percentage) of the bad asbestos. It is very possible the test was inaccurate or contaminated from a different source, but that is the purpose of the investigation.
Money.....J&J buys laws with lobbyists
That’s the power of corporate lobbyists
Vapes are a problem because they cut into cigarette sales which Government gets disbursement payments on bases on the amount of cigarettes sold.  #followtherabbit
Because baby powder is not a multi billion dollar industry that threatens anyone who makes medication to treat pain, inflammation, and sleep issues.
But they sterilized a bunch of us in the 1920s for own well being! Maybe they got it wrong on baby powder, but think about all the things they get right! (/s)
It was all over cable news a few months ago. There's also been a couple of lawsuits about it.
Baby powder isn’t cutting into the sales of huge corporations.
There’s metals in the cereal, out water is contaminated, climate change will kill us in 20 years, why is nobody vaccinating their kids!? 
Media, parents, Gov, organizations: I sleep

Any thing that you smoke, and put in your body with your own consent and no one should do a whole crusade campaign of marketing and bombardment about what I put in my body
Media, parents, Gov, organizations: real shit !! 

Bonus 

Alabama outlawing abortion’s: I sleep 

Me wanting to choose putting this smoke in my body: real shit?!
Yeah and why isn't the media drowning in this as well. Why, instead of questions about the candidates age only prooving ageism, didn't they get asked questions about large companies poisoning people?
Well, the vape pens and products that didn't get pulled are owned by Phillip Morris, might want to start your search there.  The same guys who never went to jail for mass murder and lying to Congress.  Are you surprised they'd use market manipulations and easy manipulation to create a captive market?

J&J isn't attempting to sell a toxic product.  This is likely a Chinese supplier.
"I can stop recalling whenever I want. I just don't want to."
Did you put quotes because he actually said that or...?
The question is not if it had asbestos but if it exceeded the permissable exposer limit which is .1 fibers per cubic centimeter of air in an 8 hour period with an excusion limit of 1 fiber per cubic centimeter over a thirty minute period.  It matters how they tested the baby powder and if they did it in the way the standard consumer uses the product.  This was almpst certainly not done and was instead just analyzed in a small sample put into a container.
There's nothing sacrosanct about the FDA.
They should start *really* going after these companies.

Not a pittance for a fine, not a week or a month of revenue but much more.

And the people who make it happen, untangle the deliberately confusing mess and jail them for a long long time.
Some interesting history to look into. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot
Apparently the baby powder comes with the asbestos. Its a two in one product. Like shampoo and conditioner.
The asbestos has been contaminated with talcum powder, so now they’re in hot water.
Milton Friedman would be so proud.

Talking about his shareholder theory over stakeholder theory bullshit... aka the so-called Friedman Doctrine: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine
Except that J&J knew since 1971 that their talc sometimes tested positive for asbestos
Appease investors while quietly extracting as much value as they possibly can out of people.

The U.S. was built on the exploitation of people.  Now that it's finally starting to run out of foreigners to exploit, the targets are now average Americans.
Well then God is guilty! 
FFS
Nothing you can do now. Nearly every American has been exposed to J&J baby powder at some point. How it will affect you is anyone's guess, but it should have no affect on your unborn baby.
Stop using any product that uses talc. Like some baby powders, foot powders, etc...

The amount of asbestos is small in most talc so unless you used it a lot for a decade chances are you will be fine.
Won't affect your baby, asbestos is deposited in your lungs.  Fibres get stuck there and cause damage which eventually leads to cancer.
I'd go see your doctor and ask about it.
The risk is from potential inhalation of the powder.  Just use a cream/paste for any type of diaper rash. We use Boudreaux's butt paste, not sure how nationwide it is but it's available on Amazon. Our baby girl is just about to turn 1 year old in a few days and I can confirm it seems to do a great job.
You should absolutely not use baby powder on your baby. My doctor told me this over twenty years ago. Not because of asbestos, but it can cause serious respiratory issues for your baby.
ooh, is THAT what those comment numbers never matching the actual comments in a thread mean. I was wondering.
Multi million dollar corporations bribe their politician, excuse me I mean donate, good money so they never have to face consequences.
It’s just added fire protection for baby’s bottom.
How can you see them?
like the time no more tears was found to have two formaldehyde-releasing preservatives classified as known human carcinogens by the EPA?

or like the time they advertised Tylenol as "nothing's safer" and didn't disclose the active ingredient acetaminophen caused liver failure leading to multiple overdoses and even deaths, then defended their position by saying their labeling was a suicide prevention measure. 

or the time it was caught selling unregistered and misbranded pesticides to veterinary clinics and laboratories.

or The time it was caught making false claims about the drug Natrecor and recommending it for uses which it had not been approved by the FDA?

or they time they had to pay criminal fines over allegations they had actually bribed doctors and pharmacists to recommend an anti-psychotic called Risperdal for off label usage.

or the time they knowning sold defective blood glucose monitors?
Talc, what J&J used in their baby powder, is a natural mineral. The problem is asbestos is also a mineral that is commonly found with talc.

So during mining they can get mixed. Usually its not a lot and if you use talc once or twice a year chances are it will not affect you. But many people use baby powder everyday. So over time it builds up and can cause cancer.
I think it's more likely the FDA is protecting companies.
For the cancer? It’s not a conclusion that the baby powder actually caused ovarian cancer. From what ive read it’s difficult to prove because studies depend on memories of how often the talc was used. And from what I understand asbestos is harmful when inhaled, and there hasn’t been any conclusion that it can cause cancer if it touches your skin.sSo inhaling asbestos tainted talc can cause mesothelioma and it’s still unknown whether it causes ovarian.
Yes there has been reports of asbestos in their baby powder and talc products in small trace amounts since the 80s. They used their clout to have the report shelved and lobbied against any restrictions. Numerous women who use it as a femineine vagina product have died of ovarian and stomache cancer. These are all facta and have been reported in the news heavily since 2016. How can people like you be so uninformed.
If you Google "talc" and "asbestos" three of the top four results are sites run by plaintiffs law firms. Those sites are mesothelioma.com, asbestos.com, and asbestos.net. They do not provide health advice, they provide leads to law firms to sue to make money. Lawyers stand to make billions of dollars off of these lawsuits, as long as they can get one verdict on their side.
Nah he used alternative facts. Totally legit now.
Look no further for examples of hysterical, ignorant and innumerate reactions PRECISELY the kind of stuff crooked tort lawyers look for in jurors.
Where is that comment with the 1800 number...
There have been numerous huge lawsuits against j&j these past few years. Its been all over the news, how can people not know about this.
You can be mad at Johnson and Johnson without simultaneously licking the boots of the rich white hegemony that doesn't have to live by the rules the rest of us do, did you know that?
Well, corporations are people but CEOs aren't actually people because they never get put into jail. So, since you can't actually put a corporation in jail and the CEO isn't actually a person, well, I guess we can give them a strongly worded letter and a vigorous finger wag, a stern look and a fine that amounts to a small fraction of what they made selling the product. That'll teach 'em!
makes a good face powder too
Asbestos and talc are commonly found together afaik, so when mining for the talcum powder (trace/concentrated) amounts of asbestos will be present that need to be removed
It's more not removing it well enough.
Who is going to be the person dissolving the board? Who fires the CEO? The board IS the company.

Do you really think that giving the government the ability to nationalize companies they don't like--take their profits, nullify existing employment contracts with employees (even if they are executives), and oversee all their operations (all without due process)--is a good idea?

Yes, that is crazy.
Contamination while mining for talc. White asbestos and talc are often found in close proximity.
Only takes a tiny bit of asbestos to give you cancer. Don't believe me? Breathe in some asbestos.
Yeah that one was crazy too.
I read that. I have a 3 month old who will not be eating that shit.
That was a whacko group reporting infinitesimally small amounts as if they were relevant.
I fell for this one initially as well with a toddler and 3month old in my house but it's important to fact check these claims.

I still don't trust anyone else to make my kids food though she we make it at home with produce from the store and a food processor.
Damn glad I got a vasectomy...
Juul is owned 1/3 by Phillip Morris. So no.
Apparently it’s not so much cig companies, but state governments, who don’t get the same revenue from vaping as they do from tobacco sales due to the terms of tobacco settlements.
You do realize cigarette campanies own just about every vape company. Use some common sense kid.
Cornstarch baby powders work they just have the unfortunate side effect of making it's way into your pockets and coating everything in them.
Or you know, people just don't like other people blowing clouds of sickly sweet flavored vapor, trying to make nicotine addiction seem cool. I'm not out there trying to outlaw vape pens and I don't know anything about the health value (though directly inhaling air passing across metal heating elements probably had some negative side effects) but that doesn't mean I have to like them.
The liability is actually a bit different, product liability is strict liability, if your product hurt someone, you owe money, even if you couldn't have reasonably known it would have hurt someone.
That breaking and entering and suing thing is fucking made up. It's a fucking urban legend.
I've read otherwise
r/HailCorporate is leaking
Exactly, gotta follow the money trail
There are safer ways to ingest THC and/or CBD than by vaping it.
Because that's what he *would* have said if he ever had to be accountable for his actions.  But he's just going to go home and sip his glass of childrens' tears.

“Quotes done like this” are paraphrasing or otherwise intended as non-literal, such as sarcasm (eg, “what we meant to say was that we didn’t think we’d get caught”).

Thanks for asking the real questions
TR’s been rolling in his fucking grave for decades.
Yeah that would happen in a just and democratic society, but actually this is an oligarchy where corporations make the laws to suit their reckless pursuit of profit over humanity so...

Every time you don't vote, or vote for a conservative pol (which is both Republicans and 98% of Democrats in the US), remember you are enabling this to go on.

Also, change "they" in your statement to "we". *We* have to do it, not some vague other.
Agreed 100% percent
Maybe they shouldn't settle.
J&J just got hit with a 8 **B**illion dollar verdict for Risperdal. Between that, this, and the opiods, they are starting to get hit with some real money. It was that big because a jury found they mislead and deceived the public on that drug too.
Like alcohol and my liver damage.
It's a floor wax. It's a dessert topping.
I actually read through one of the "reports" that someone linked me from one of the tort lawfirms claiming J&J "knew" about asbestos since the 70's. It was a lab report about trying to use electron microscopy to identify asbestos fibers in talc, and the results were inconclusive. They couldn't tell the difference between some fibers that definitely weren't asbestos and some fibers in talc that tested negative for asbestos. That was it, that was all there was in the lab report from the 70s. If you have something else I will look at it, but I suspect you saw the same headline on reddit that I did and didn't dig into it and don't have a scientific background required to do that.
Ok. So it’s not an isolated issue to J&J. I didn’t realize that any talc powder contained asbestos. 

I have [this](https://www.burtsbees.com/product/baby-bee-dusting-powder/VM-36599-00.html)  Burts Bees Baby : Dusting Powder. It says is Talc Free. This is ok for me to use then?
A lot of high end makeup also contains talc.
The majority of studies on asbestos-related disease have been carried out with people who would've inhaled asbestos fibers as part of their work.  It makes sense we'd most strongly associate lung cancers with asbestos for this reason.  There's evidence, however, that asbestos [may also cause other types of cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/asbestos/asbestos-fact-sheet#what-factors-affect-the-risk-of-developing-an-asbestos-related-disease) such as of the stomach or colon.  

It does make one wonder how many asbestos-related cancers go undetected because we're not accustomed to looking for evidence of asbestos exposure in people with non-lung-related cancers who have no history of workplace exposure.  Unfortunately, there [hasn't been a lot of research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499908/) in this area.
Why does it lead to ovarian cancer as opposed to lung cancer then?
I will ask my doc. Thanks.
Butt paste. LOL 
Seriously though, thank you. I won’t be using any powder with mine.
You can't. Shadow banned people will count on the comments meter. But will not show up. So if it says 5 comments but you only see 2, then 3 are shadow banned.
Wow TIL. I figured this was a case of a cheap or evil subcontractor cutting the product with something. I'm very interested to know what the concentration of asbestos in the talc was, and how much is considered dangerous. Is this like measuring radiation, where you get a positive measurement way below the level where you start to see health effects?
I thought talc was phased out for baby powder use decades ago and it's been corn starch for a loooong time....I guess not?
so in your opinion should talc be banned?
[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html) the actual data is not so conclusive...
I have never heard anything about it at all.  Guess it is time to hit google.
Maybe you should take a breath and reread what I wrote.
those "heavy metals" are typically iron and zinc, virtually all cereals have iron and zinc intentionally added because people eat too much processed foods nowadays.

We need actually need a certain amount of iron and zinc in our diets and the main consumer base of cereals are unlikely to meet their recommend daily intake. 

Unfortunately this does mean that there is some level of cross contamination with similar products like baby cereal. While not ideal it is not found in high enough amounts to cause problems and can even be beneficial in some cases, particularly if they have a poor diet.

Comparing a minor issue like that to asbestos contamination is disingenuous, there's absolutely no reason, nor any upside to having asbestos in your products.
Your 3 month old eats pieces of shit for breakfast???
I have a 13 month old who has eaten it every day since he was 7 months :/
The problem isn’t the baby food, the problem is all food. The heavy metals are found in all food, the headline just pointed out baby food. Even if you feed your kid organic and blended by you purées, s/he is still consuming toxic metals. We have abused our air, water and soil and nature is paying us back ... with interest.
That’s baby food, the baby cereal thing is very recent and the numbers are much higher.
It's quite likely that the food you make for your kids has higher levels of toxins than bottled food. Remember we're talking about teeny-tiny-teeny-tiny amounts. This is stuff like a single invisible fleck of garden dirt on fresh produce that, like most dirt, contains metals and toxins. There is no reason to avoid bottled food, though fresh is preferable.
two words: regulatory capture

Big companies like regulations when they're written to suit their business model and keep smaller companies from being able to compete
I think government regulation is aimed more towards the flavored vapes and their “influence on kids”. In reality, it eliminates a lot of alternatives for people looking to quit smoking and keeps profits rolling back in for the corporations.
What, this doesn't invalidate anything. They diversified and now they are trying to squash the market. Juul pulled a ton from the shelves everywhere almost. They do not want cigarettes to die to vape.
Juul getting kicked in the nuts because of kids dying from thc vapes was unintentional.  However Phillip Morris' endgame was and still is to get vapes banned because after the ban, the FDA is allowing exceptions.  Exceptions that only tobacco companies rich enough can buy.  You can read up or just keep on parroting what uninformed redditors are saying.
They'll be 100% owned once Juul's stock price totally tanks.
Man if I was a cigarette company and knew that buying a non-controlling share of a single vape company was all the smokescreen I needed to ban my rival, I'd spend that money in a heartbeat.
Not the big ones, until Malboro overtook Juul

Its been proven that the cigarette companies were lobbying against vapes while also developing their own vape products. It was to stall time- they dont like new blood taking over the market.

They banned them preemptively in China and India already. Millions upon millions of people smoking cigs everyday, and they saw the writing on the wall as soon as Juul and the like began taking over their customer base. 

How many times have cig companies advertised to children? How many people have died directly because of cigarettes? But theyre fine, because America was developed in large part by tobacco farms since its early history, so these companies have history with the government.
[removed]
They bought stock in their competitors to hedge their bets. They do not own the major vape companies, although some have tried to market their own products.
No one is saying you have to like them. You're free to hate it if you like. What i'm saying is that people already disliked vaping before anyone really got down to talking about negative health effects. The same cannot be said of baby powder. Which primed people toward wanting to ban vaping. Meanwhile, since people have never thought about baby powder even having the possibility of there being bad things in it, baby powder doesn't get anywhere near the same amount of attention. Although maybe it should.

Again the cloud thing is a preference based thing. You're free to not like it. Free to hate it even but clouds don't automatically lead to danger. Also, an insane amount of vapers aren't doing it to make it look cool to others. The kinds of people you're talking about aren't the majority.

Once more, i was just talking about how people already didn't like vaping way before anyone said anything about the possibility of negative health problems. Which made it easier to ban, easier to throw mud at and easier for the government to be wrong about.

A lot of the time public opinion has to change about a thing before other things can happen with it.
Happened to my dad's best friend. Burglar hopped their fence while fleeing the scene (neighbor's house) and his leg was bitten by their rottweiler. He sued them. Eventually the case was dismissed, but they had to pay for a lawyer and crap first.
Try a different more thorough source about this issue in particular.

Yep, and a lot of states are basically broke.  They'll do what they can to bring in more cash.
Yes there is. 

I’m sorry, but this is the same government that is totally cool with cigarettes , firearms, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol. 
All of which combined kills millions if people.

But crack down on cannabis vapes, sure....
But this is Johnson & Johnson.

You’re either moral, fair and honest,

Or you’re evil, unfair, and a liar.

“We” never does anything.

“He” - the  one who lied for profit - did something. “You” or “I” - can pick up a rock or gun and stop him from doing more things. “We” are powerless to stop anyone. “I” or “you” always have a chance of killing or severely injuring any attacker.

Always remember you have the power to kill, and suspect anyone who tells you to rely on a “We,” “us” or “them” to do your dirty work for you.
Yeah, government is so much cleaner,  and government bureaucrats are sooo capable.
I agree, don't let these predatory companies get away with a slap on the wrist.

Do you have a link to that report?
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/baby-powder-asbestos-johnson-johnson.html

And my chemistry doctorate isn't required when the executive memos are reported as the following:

"An executive at Johnson & Johnson said the main ingredient in its best-selling baby powder could potentially be contaminated by asbestos, the dangerous mineral that can cause cancer. He recommended to senior staff in 1971 that the company “upgrade” its quality control of talc.  Two years later, another executive raised a red flag, saying the company should no longer assume that its talc mines were asbestos-free. The powder, he said, sometimes contained materials that “might be classified as asbestos fiber.”"
This is the most important comment in the thread.
>I didn’t realize that any talc powder contained asbestos. 

Talc and white asbestos are both silicate minerals and are often located together in underground deposits, so cross-contamination happens sometimes.
Talc or no, there's really no need to use "baby powder" on a baby
Should be fine. Non talc generally means cornstarch based
No, Burt's Bees was Hostile taken over, and isn't run as ethically as it used to be.
Just buy a big jug of cornstarch from Costco.
It leads to ovarian cancer because many women use it in the perineal area.
It doesn't, but tort lawyers can make a bunch of money off random people who got ovarian cancer by saying it does. A court is not a scientific research institute, and a jury of random schlubs definitely aren't trained to evaluate evidence scientifically.
Good call.
Same happens when someone deletes their comment.

Not everything is a conspiracy.
Gotcha, thanks.
Its very low levels for the most part. But there is no safe level of asbestos. Hence why a couple low level exposures will most likely not cause any issues.       
But a big one is women used this in their groin region and underwear everyday for decades. Many of them are now showing heightened cases of cancer. 


So this is not a clear case of it will affect everyone. But J&J has paid for a lot of scientist to say what they want and when test did show asbestos in their talc they tried to cover it up. Hence why this new test showing there is still small traces of asbestos in their talc is so alarming. As its been known and they have been spending a lot of money on PR to downplay this. So they are trying to make sure their product is 100% clean right now and still can't do that when people are watching them like a hawk.
Many use starch now but I think J&J still uses talc. 

That and many, most?, foot powder still has talc.
I would lean toward yes in the case of baby powder. Other areas it may still be needed like industrial perhaps. 

There are other options for baby powder that serve that purpose like starch for example. So to high risk for little reward with other inexpensive options.
Um yes its pretty clear. For one there is no level of safe asbestos exposure. Asbestos even at minute levels can cause cancer. J&J talc products tested positive for asbestos in minute amounts, the argument over what constitutes trace is mute because there is no safe level of exposure.
Why would I want reread you licking rich people fucking boots and acting like them going to jail for breaking the law isn't important?
Yeah but this one was arsenic.  They did not mention asbestos in the baby foods though, so that is a plus.
What if the issue is “elevated levels of inorganic arsenic?” Is it still minor then? Because that’s one of the main heavy metal containments in baby food. [Source.](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-safety/arsenic-and-lead-are-in-your-fruit-juice-what-you-need-to-know/)

Edit: The FDA categorizes juice boxes as a child/baby food, people. It’s not my fault that most reporting on this week’s baby food study isn’t as thorough as the one from earlier this year on juice products. You can either have a good source about juice or the shitty one below about baby food.
You can feed your baby all the arsenic you want bro but I'd like to keep children I care about alive a bit longer.
Sweet write up though
found out about the iron and zinc thing because it’s literally labeled on the box, including its “percent of daily value” indicating that even the FDA says it’s one of the minerals needed. 

I’ve only heard one person say asbestos is/can be safe and he’s currently being impeached... I told my dad, if it happens, to breath deep now so we can cash in on the lawsuits later
There's also lead and arsenic, because our soil is fucked.
Quick google search about baby foods also mentions, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury..
What's the basis?
Grizzly Adams DID have a beard
So has every baby for the past 80 years, you’ll be fine.
I'm assuming you have stopped giving him it now, it's fine. You didn't know.
This is crazy.  Should we also ban fruity flavored alcohol as well? There's a vodka that tastes like froot loops for Christ sake.
nicotine replacement products are still the recommended first
sounds like you're making it up as you go along to fit your liberal narrative, unless you have proof for your last sentence
They don't want vaping to die either, since it has an actual future.
Always follow the money.
Just like all the craft beer that's just Coors/Miller/Bud owned but branded differently.

What did you think happened to all those tears?
Quotation marks have long been used to mock someone's supposed beliefs or thoughts without honestly claiming to be directly quoting the person. You have to take some context into account.
Misleading information in the internet  , including ; improper punctuation 'whaa"?
The internet has expanded how we use grammar to express ourselves.  I've seen three uses of quotes.  The first is as you describe, to indicate they are exactly relating what someone has said.  The second is the [scare quote.](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/quotes/scare)  The third is to highlight *the writer's interpretation* of the subtext of what someone says or does.  It's the third use we're seeing in the OP.  No one really thinks a Johnson & Johnson exec would say something like that, but it's what their actions seem to be saying.
I'm quite certain this is a you-problem.
Language is constantly evolving. Deal with it.
>You see, being a pompous ass and acting condescending is in poor taste. Whether or not it's a factual statement, formatting matters.
 
>My attitude about grammar comes from a very dark place, and everyone who reads my comments believe it. We all know what Wayne Gretzky said and it turns out you have my stapler. Not cool.
 
-Micheal Scott.
Fair enough. J&J is a US-based company (though of course they operate and sell products worldwide), so this is primarily where we would need to hold them accountable.
Yup... that's why the goverment should get rid of non-poltical appointee career civil servants who have their jobs through normal merit-based hiring (aka bureaucrats), just have politicans but no actual public service, stay hands off, deregulate, and let the free market decide.  /s

^(like wtf is wrong with half this thread... swear it's filled with corporate crisis management pr trolls and/or brain dead poltical shills)
Well it's you personally attacking your liver. Maybe wean it down. Go have an edible or some shit.
Found it:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5017565-1972-through-1992-lab-reports.html

The reporter that is using this highlighted the part where scanning electron microscopy (SEM) person reported that they believe there is asbestos. But the next lines in the actual conclusion states that SEM was unable to differentiate asbestos from a bunch of other fibers that could be present, so that wasn't a reliable test.
And thus they do asbestos testing on all their talc.
Nah, cause he didn't cite the supposed report, which he should have if he's got a source. Otherwise it's just like this report I'm reading, that says you're mom is a bitch and everyone in the world owes me five bucks, as in made up.
Care to elaborate?
I’ll look for talc free only products for sure.
Ugh. How disappointing. When you say hostile taken over, you mean by another company that kept the original name?
It wasn't a hostile takeover, just an all cash purchase by Clorox.
How does someone get shadow banned ?
Wild, I had no idea. That shit should have been banned long ago.
I've used both, they both seem to work just about the same to me.
You have no actual idea what the risk is (and you don't even know it). That's even worse than the usual fallacy of '1 chance in ten million is a three alarm fire' (but good enough for tort lawyers to get paid millions. 

.
So if what you say is true (Any level of asbestos causes cancer and that J&J talc has asbestos) why is there a complete lack of consensus/clear evidence that points to an increased risk of cancer in those that used Talc products?
Moot not mute.
Fuck, you have issues. Try again. Come on, you can do it.
and lead. 1 in 5 baby foods tested in the NYT article showed above allowable lead concentrations
Arsenic lead and cadmium.  All really bad stuff.  Apparently rice carrots and sweet potatoes are the worst offenders because they absorb it more readily.
Arsenic is a natural compound and occurs naturally in food. In order to make an arsenic free food you would need to process it out which could reduce other micronutrients that are naturally in the baby food.
Arsenic is super common across almost all soils. Its also in much higher concentrations in soils near industrial areas such as the midwest. 

That being said, arsenic like mercury varies in toxcicity depending on the form: 

https://pmj.bmj.com/content/79/933/391
wait what the shit?
The article you linked has nothing to do with baby food. It's about fruit juice. Did you even read it?

Furthermore, the article states that 20 out of 21 of the juices tested had levels of inorganic arsenic *lower* than the FDA maximum (i.e., safe level) for drinking water of 10 ppb. And 58% had levels lower than 3 ppb. The only one that had a level higher than the FDA drinking water maximum was apple juice from Trader Joe's at 15.4 ppb.
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
[removed]
Sure ban them too.  Heroin is  addictive and banned, should we ban nicotine as well?
Obviously, but we’re talking about government regulation of electronic cigarettes.
You mean like a flavored vape with 0% nicotine?
What? Banning flavored vapor products removes a portion of nicotine secession products leaving mainly menthol and tobacco flavors. Flavors that juul heavily produces and sells. That would directly benefit them. It’s already a staple of their business model.
That was the point, cigarette companies already have substantial ties to the vaping market, and that one is actually growing. The last thing they want is to kill it.
Yes Juul is big but there are tons of new small businesses that create their own juice and get steady followings. I'd but money on their being 100 small shops that make their product being in a 10-20 mile radius of my house.
A large stake, but still a minority one. They couldn't have anticipated media frenzy taking out their competitors for them, so they bought some of their stock.
Oh. 

Oh god.
No more tears

*Tears*

As in "*rips*"

"No more rips"

Gentle on a baby's scalp. Not their eyes. Fuckin J&J
That's due to an excess of Asbestos in their baby powder. All those tear ducts dried up from kids touching themselves and then touching their faces..... or something like that.
Actually it’s tears as in the act of “tearing your hair out”, Not tears as in “to cry”  It’s has hair conditioner in it.

If you need more proof, pick a bottle and get some of the soap in your eyes and “see” how things go.

I think this is a *bit* too much role-playing going on here.
True, but I am of the opinion that no company is too big to fail. If they knowingly deceive people and can't handle the fallout then perhaps they should not exist.
If only you applied the same standard to woster's comment, since the person making the claim should be the one citing evidence.
They didn't use it at the hospital with my daughters and the pediatrician said not to use it. Not just because of the inhalation risk, but because it also tends to dry the skin *too* much resulting in further irritation, cracking, etc. If you're trying to treat diaper rash, zinc oxide cream is safer and [more effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901362/).
Talc is a powder, so it can easily be breathed in by the people using it. While it's not particularly awful, babies can have some respiratory issues breathing in the particles.
I read baby powder can get in babies lungs.
babies have been raised effectively before "baby powder" was even a thing. and in this modern world, there a lot of other alternatives to whatever talcum powder is supposed to do. there is no absolute need to use talcum powder on babies
Just don't bother. Baby powder isn't that useful, if they get a rash use a cream and it'll clear it up faster anyway. I have a 9 month old and we haven't used it a single time. 

Also congrats!
Clorox, the Bleach company.

But it works a lot better than corn starch.
There have been studies that show higher cancer rates. There need to be more to give a real risk estimate. But this isn't some lifesaving product. It's just baby powder. No one would miss it after six months
J&J lobbied politicians heavily to avoid any regulation of their talc products and they won. They challeneged the samples that showed asbestos they challeneged the methods those lab tests used that indicated asbestos and they created doubt. They spent huge amounts of money on this effort and its all been recently documented.The fact is that asbestos dont leave the body and cause internal microabrasians.That may turn cancerous in some people.
Isn't the allowable lead threshold 0?
Yeah that was pretty much the problem.  It said 1 in 5 foods tested had 10x the ppm of lead that was recommended for health reasons.
[CNN article](https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/10/17/health/baby-foods-arsenic-lead-toxic-metals-wellness/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) 

Also lead and cadmium apparently.
There are other articles I could have linked; this one was simply the best written and most thorough in explaining how the contaminants in these products occur, as well as listing the measurements in products geared towards children. Though beyond linking you [this other one](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-safety/most-baby-foods-contain-arsenic-lead-and-other-heavy-metals/), I don’t imagine I’ll be interested in furthering this conversation if you’re going to cherry pick information or pretending that you can’t look this shit up for yourself while simultaneously pretending that you know something about the topic. Anyone that sees juice boxes and doesn’t think “for children,” read that article and doesn’t understand that it’s communicating a problem with the FDA limits, or that has a comment history like yours, is clearly not interested in a conversation.

Edit: Ah yes, the ole “Reddit sides with the inflammatory troll rather than read the articles or listen to the scientists” bit. Also, hi, I’m /u/Atlas2001, and I work for a company that contracts with the FDA. The FDA requires studies like this to inform policy change. Technically all of their regulations are incorrect if there will ever be a study that forces them to change (which happens frequently).
We eatin soon fam 🌊🌊🌊
Those are correlated. It's not an unreasonable estimate. But how's this: each generation in the 20th century saw progressively worse wars. Vietnam was a clusterfuck, and the soldiers coming home were even spat on. That's around the time of banning lead. The 80s saw an end to the cold war, the next generation didn't have a major conflict to traumatise them. The decline in crime was worldwide though, so maybe with the tension of the cold war, people had more hope for the future. The ending of tension was under the leadership who smoked lead.

Maybe crime rate stayed the same, but the "war on crime" shifted actors into alternative, harder to prosecute crimes? Wasnt the rate of litigation in the 90s increasing, so people felt they could seek redress within the system instead of outside it. 

These would give predictive test. Has crime increased as a result of entrenched unending military engagement, and a decline of trust in the system?
Roe v. Wade is the cause of the crime drop in the US.
Yet there's more young people of voting age than old.

They just don't vote.

For example, despite significant left leanings near 70% of 18-29 year olds in the 2016 election helped elect Donald Trump.

They're not stupid, they're entitled and self serving.  Can hardly blame people who can't fend for themselves using legislative means to survive.
Nope. Heroin shouldn’t be banned for adults either. If someone wants to destroy their bodies with drugs, let them do it in a controlled environment.
Jeez I wonder why they won't ban menthols though.  Is it because they make tons of money off menthol cigarettes?  They are so transparent.
They do want to kill it.. temporarily.. because that will kill all the online shops, vape shops, juice labs, and their distributors.  Then they will apply for exceptions.  None of these guys have the money to apply for these exceptions because they count on volume and variety.  If a small business owner requires 50 different products to make a living, that's 50 applications and he will go bankrupt.  50 in being modest.  Walk into a vape shop and you'll see hundreds of different products in various nicotine strengths.  Juul, Blu etc have one model, a handful of flavors in just one nicotine strength, and an enormous bankroll.  They will be the only survivors and that would be a huge victory for them.
and all those products combined make <1% of what Juul does. Both are true. Those shops also sell juul too. Both are true if you will.
And a happy cake day to you.  Want something to wash down that cake?
It's an Instagram myth when user *Fuck Jerry* shared a screenshot of a Tumblr conversation of someone claiming to go blind for three days after squirting the J&J Shampoo in their eyes. Someone commented that the "No Tears" actually referred to the hair, not the eyes. A short wildfire of social media reiterating this led to the conclusion that: No, the "No Tears" does NOT refer to hair and is advertised appropriately to prevent stinging on the eyes from the soap. It's is important to note that it's about the bubbly suds produced by the soaps that are "No Tears" guaranteed, NOT the liquid soap directly from the bottle -- this is because the chemicals have been manufactured specifically to have larger molecules in the soap when it oxidizes, which in turn makes it more dense and is not able to penetrate the eyes.

What a bummer. 

So the little info I found about the sale said one of the co-founders sold it to Clorox but didn’t mention anything hostile and that she bought out Burt’s part for $130k in 1999. 

Could you elaborate on the hostile part please?
See what?
So? I think not being at a higher risk for cancer wins over making my balls less sweaty.
It's not up to you to decide what others want
First off, they clearly had regulations on talc so your first sentence is basically saying they lobbied to have less restrictions on their product, which is literally what every company ever does for every single product, so that's not news.  Secondly, they should challenge samples if they are appropriate to challenge and not challenge them if they aren't, the problem is that me and you both have no idea if it was legitimate or not to challenge the results.  They have had the vast majority of tests not show talc in their product so when one does show asbestos, it would be appropriate to second guess the result and see if it's a false positive.  Moreover, like this recent report of asbestos they actually recalled the talc as they continue sampling/testing which is what you'd want them to do, right?  I don't get people's obsessions with mediocre science to try to fuck over a pharmaceutical company.  Here is the real question and should be asked at every trial, people who used talc have gotten cancer, but people who have not used talc have gotten cancer too, do the former get cancer at a higher rate or is their any evidence that the talc caused the cancer.  I showed before their is super inconclusive evidence that cancer occurs in higher rates in people who used talc,  (for example in smoking and lung cancer the evidence was incredibly overwhelming, this is not that).  Now here is where i might agree with you, there are some cases where it looks like, yah, maybe the talc did cause the cancer (asbestos in the tumor sample, etc.) but then there are 500 cases where its just a lady with ovarian cancer wanting someone or something to blame and it's unclear if talc had anything to do with anything.  So this debate will keep going on forever but J&J is a good company, employs thousands of people, makes many breakthrough discovery's etc.  If we lost J&J it would really be terrible for America.

Fine libertarian view, definitely not a popular opinion among the majority of voters though.
One thing I keep coming back to is the fact that if we restrict flavors to tobacco and menthol, it keeps vapes more "cigarette-like."

Because honestly, most of these flavors make cigarettes taste like shit in comparison.
So uh did you know about all this arsenic?
Uhhh ok
Your casual knowledge... from these reddit threads... Of people posting this same stuff. Also how the hell am I supposed to find a random internal report some person linked me as "proof" like 4-5 months ago. I can't just google "that one johnson and johnson report from the 70s I saw" it wasn't even plaintext, it was scanned images of typewriter(?) print.
If diapers tested positive for asbestos, yeah. But this issue is a little different. Cause there's fucking asbestos and it's a fucking baby.
Just that Burt was cut out from all future profits and feels hard done by.
I dunno the details, just something I read in passing.
Burt's wife essentially stole the company from him iirc
It wasn't a hostile takeover. Clorox just bought the company.
Despite the recent lawsuit, there isn't actually much in the way of scientific evidence indicating that talcum powder increases your risk of cancer.  That doesn't really matter on Reddit, of course, I understand.
Not a hypothesis.  The five states that allowed abortion in 1970 experienced declines in crime earlier than the rest of the nation, which legalized abortion in 1973.
You cant use "world wide" metrics. Access to abortion only reduces crime where there is no benefit to having additional children, which is essentially developed nations like the US. 

Places like India where large families are almost a requirement in poverty stricken areas arent going to see this same drop, because they would rarely use abortion services.

Its not as simple as one or the other. Its most likely both to be honest.
The heavy metals in baby food are found in all foods grown from the soil. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead are naturally occurring in the soil.
No, the claim made by the person prior was based on a causal argument that lead caused intellectual dysfunction of a specific age group and thereby the difficulties are based on that age group voting.  I countered with the group was not stupid and faulting a group for legislating their own perpetual care when they're infirm is irrational and should be expect

Your assessment of "old" as per the person prior seems incorrect.
I’m actually progressive lol. But true, not a popular opinion. A girl can dream.
Cigs taste better than the Tobacco flavoured shit they sell, I had some 'Cuban Tobacco' Vape juice from Naked Juice, and it tasted like a weird off putting Okra.. terrible tasting shit
It's all hearsay and dubious claims. There is no direct correlation between the baby powder and ovarian cancer/tumors/etc- always do your research and don't believe every scientific journal.
Nah, fossil hunting. Talc is coming found with anthophyllite, one of the asbestiform minerals, along with sometimes having an asbestiform structure itself, when the small plates form long fibers easily separable by hand.
Ok. Still bad they sold to Clorox though. Thanks for info’
A) not all soil. If all the soil had the same shit in it there would be a smaller variety of fertilizers out there.
 
And even if they were, different foods would concentrate them differently, which can be useful for bioremediation.
 
B) even if it were it would still be a bad thing we should try to fix.
Oh so they’re natural and must be totally safe!
Well these companies realize they CAN occur together as well, and that's why they watch out for it, are careful about the talc they mine, and test for it.
>District Judge Thad Balkman said he made a mistake in his August  judgment ordering the company to pay the state $572 million to address  the opioid crisis. That sum included $107 million for treating babies  born addicted to opioids, when in fact Balkman said the figure should be  $107,000

It seems its actually really cheap to treat babies addicted to opioids. Or maybe babies aren't worth much, given:

>The state had asked for $17 billion to compensate for the deaths of more than 4,000 residents over the past 20 years.
107K. That is nothing in medical debt terms...I doubt that would cover the care of one sickly infant.
He realized his mistake after he got notification of his numbered off shore bank account had a 7 figure fund deposited into it.
And suddenly the judge has $106 million. How in the fuck are they going to treat babies with just $107,000? That’s not enough for even one baby. Specially when hospitals claim like $2000 for a teddy bear
Yesterday I used Soy Sauce instead of Worcestershire Sauce, mistakes are easy to make.
even if it wasn't a mistake, Johnson & Johnson would probrally sue to get it reduced to a "oh golly gosh darn-it" slap on the wrist and a promise to not do it again with crossed fingers.
Way to go, team! Not only did we make ourselves look incredibly bad, we fucked over countless people!
The solution has existed for generations but yet yall keep disregarding the term 'eat the rich'
$107,000 doesn't sound right. That's like the cost for 1 child overnight in a US hospital isnt it?
To Billionaires, hundreds of millions are like pennies to normal folks. A fine should hurt. This judge needs to take remedial math classes.
107 million sounds more accurate given the price of American healthcare and how much J&J made off their lies and American lives.

Bet next time I go on the youtube app I get a J&J ad about how great a company they are...

Just pulling bullshit numbers out of their asses anyhow. 

What’s the point in the fucking FDA if following their own regulations, companies can still be fucked like this?
> It seems its actually really cheap to treat babies addicted to opioids over there

Maybe the  judge wanted to treat 5 babies and call it a day.
How does a state sue for compensation for the deaths of their citizens? Not a lawyer, obviously.
It's for communication expenses:

>The drugmaker maintained the miscalculation resulted in the amount the judge awarded for the costs to the state for developing and disseminating information on treating babies born addicted to opioids.
Seems like the company's goons got to the judge at 2am and persuaded him to change his decision.
So the state was getting 3% of what it asked for. But the judge made a mistake, its actually 2%
  
We really need to get rid of these judges. The system doesnt need more 2g pot smokers in jail for 15 years, it needs billions in punitive damages.
> It seems its actually really cheap to treat babies addicted to opioids.

In the grand scheme of things, it is. You know why? The baby has no choice but to cooperate with treatment. If the babies were out trying to score heroin or fentanyl patches, it would be a longer and more difficult process, but they just lie there and take their methadone until they get over the physical withdrawal. Turns out they probably don't fall off the wagon in preschool, either. They're the perfect addiction treatment patients.
[deleted]
It probably is a lot cheaper to treat babies. No need to send them to an inpatient treatment center and follow that up with intensive outpatient to try and prevent relapse.
Well you also need to factor in that Johnson and Johnson is hardly solely culpable for the problem.
The worth of a human life is quantifiable, and a human life is very much not worth 4.25 mil a piece. 

IIRC your average American life is worth about $500,000.
107k is literally a drop in the bucket for any hospital, let alone big medical device company LET ALONE the 400 billion conglomerate that is johnson and johnson
It's just for communication expenses not compensation for deaths or health care costs:

>The drugmaker maintained the miscalculation resulted in the amount the judge awarded for the costs to the state for developing and disseminating information on treating babies born addicted to opioids.
In the US, $107K would barely cover an ambulance ride and a Tylenol in a hospital.

maybe if you'd read the article you'd understand what it was for.
... did you read the article? The judgement was $107 million against Johnson &Johnson but should have been $107 thousand, according to the records. 

It’s an error in favor of the plaintiffs, not the defendant.
NICU is pretty expensive.
The real conspiracy is people not being criminally charged and put in prison, and having an abstract concept pay for human lives instead
This kind of error is precedented.   Either something happened or the judge is so incompetent he needs to be removed.
Better make it 3.5 so he has time to catch happy hour.
I mean, just stop giving them opioids. Doesn't seem that expensive to me.
In general, most states have passed consumer laws that allow the state to sue a company for deceptive or fraudulent acts.

400+m is a lot for one state. Honestly that’s actually a lot.

Did you know that if you took 9 ladies and made them have a baby it would only take 1 month?

&#x200B;

The more you know!

I would doubt that, given that infants require intensive inpatient neonatal care which is ***extremely*** expensive.
It's incredibly easy for babies to kick. They have no money and can't drive, so they can't score dope.
If using your hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of employees to spread drugs across a nation doesn't make you culpable for a national drug problem, I don't know what does.
They knowingly flooded America with poison using their considerable might and power.
Each organization has its own scale for human life. EPA has 9.1 million and FDA at 7.9 million.
The average human is "worth" nearly $10 million.  That is the average value produced by a human over their lifetime.  And that is just looking at it from the perspective of what they are producing, and not the impact they have on those around them, or the inherent value of their life.
Just to give people a scope, our hospital facility (handful of primary cares and specialty groups) collect about $335,000 in copays alone on an average DAY.
But now they can use the nice paper
"Hurting babies is bad.  Companies should never hurt babies.  You should never hurt babies."

Excellent communication, J&J.

*J&J continues to hurt babies*.
That's not what happened either, though. The total judgement was for $572 million. $107 million of that was listed as going towards, "neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treatment evaluation standards", when the original calculation was for $107,600. Thus, the final judgement (assuming absolutely no other changes in payment in any other part of the settlement) is supposed to be ~$465 million.

And Reddit will almost certainly call that number low, but that's because they think the $107,600 is supposed to cover absolutely everything related to neonatal care (it isn't, overall medical treatment is around $20 million for NAS, but thank CBS for oversimplifying it), and people will also overrate the number of cases that money will go towards, since this is an Oklahoma judgement only. If Reddit wanted to get angry at something, and they will, then they should get upset over the fact that the price is calculated to cover only one year's worth of damages, because the judge also ruled that the state didn't make a strong enough case for how they would use judgement money on opioid treatment after the first year.
Hence, the regard to fucking over countless people. :-/
Not arguing friend, lamenting within satirical derision of the point of the article.
Which people are you putting in prison?  For what crime?  Going to include the doctors who prescribed them to patients as well?
You mean unprecedented?  I doubt it’s unprecedented and it’s honestly a non-story.

But sure, it’s some small fry state court judge.  Remove him if you want.  It wasn’t the final court order so basically no one was harmed as a result.  The plaintiffs may have even been aware of the error already.
You said "3/5" wrong.
FYI: It takes time for a human to detox from drugs. a baby that doesn't "get its fix" suffers many of the same symptoms as an adult who suffers from withdrawal. Except a baby doesn't develop a resilient metabolism for a few YEARS so it can be very damaging to suffer withdrawal in the first few DAYS of living.
"Just stop letting babies smoke crack, I don't see the problem here."
Ya but how does that help the people who actually suffered? I always found that odd, like Company X does something horrible, a bunch of people die, and somehow the state deserves a payday as opposed to the families of the people who actually died? Makes no sense to me
I read this post as...  

Learn Programming Through the Attorney General  

... and was really confused for a moment.
Assuming you’re not a troll, I’ll respond.

The EPA, when calculating the economic cost of environmental disasters, considers that the average American will make approximately $8 million over the course of their lives. So if your average person lives to be 80, the EPA estimates that they earn about $100000 on average every year they are alive.

So, at $4.5 million per addict who died, that would be 45 years of their lives lost, on average.

It doesn’t really make sense to calculate out exact numbers when it comes to these things, because every addict’s death has further effects on society beyond just the salary they can no longer earn. What about all of the interest they could have made on their bank account? Retirement income? What about helping their child through college? Taking care of their parents when they’re old or infirm? Paying for their parents’ nursing home. Mowing their neighbors’ lawn? There is real monetary and non-monetary costs to society due to people dying as a result of pharmaceutical malfeasance.

Lastly, this is also not something you want to undervalue. These are just calculating damages, and damages are supposed to fix the problem that was created. But companies view damages as just a cost of doing business.

These numbers also have to be punitive. These companies need to be punished for what they’ve done.

I would love it if we dragged executives down to jail and put them on trial for creating the situations within the company that drove the whole engine to the detriment of society, but that’s not going to happen. But at least we can make companies think twice before pulling the same shit again.

$4.5 million actually seems rather low to me.
$572 million isn't that much for a state.  The cost of the opioid epidemic is far, far higher in most states.
States budgets are in the magnitude of ten to hundred billion. 400 milion is pennies to a state.
[deleted]
You are correct.  All that expensive looking kit in the NICU keeping babies alive has a very very heavy price tag attached to it on the final bills.
You don’t think anyone else has culpability?  God Reddit is so predictable.
They were a bit player in the opioid sales game, no matter how large they are otherwise. The major sellers settled instead of taking it to trial.
*the nicest paper*
Which is fucking stupid because the $107k number wasn’t just generated at random, the fucking plaintiffs produced it!
>case for how they would use judgement money on opioid treatment after the first year.

Probably either piss it all away to private industry contracts that actually achieve nothing meaningful, or find a way to use it to fund other parts of government.
Many of the people hooked on those drugs wind up in jail... Why is it unfair to put the people who they trusted in jail for abusing that trust? So yeah. Everyone responsible should see jailtime. Its the only way they would see any real consequences. Instead they pay a fine that is basically the cost of doing business when they made billions and will likely do it again in the future.
Well we know how people responded when it was the “3/5” people who had a drug problem - by locking them up, destroying communities by separating families, but oh man did some people profit through slavery -

Sorry I mean the prison system. 

Now it’s white people with the drug issue as geez I guess that’s worth of treatment and help (while letting the people who profited off the hook).

Edit: typos
Well, their supposed to do something for the cause.
It's supposed to be when the damages for the people affected weren't enough to actually bother the company, so the rest goes to the state which, at least when the state is functioning correctly, means it goes to the people in general. The money that goes to the state is mostly just punitive, while families still receive whatever damages they incurred in a civil suit.
The deaths of citizens hurts the economy and negatively effects society. So they pay for damages to society and the economy.
Essentially it's insurance for those who don't have the family or the money to sue.
In actuality, the state pays out tons of money during drug epidemics in health care, law enforcement, and social services costs. In general, the people who are suffering from addiction to these drugs do not have money to pay for their own healthcare costs and require social services to feed and shelter themselves because they are not employed. This lawsuit is to recover the government’s costs in those respects and also start new programs that will deal with the large number of addiction and diversion programs that are needed to fight back.
While you’re correct, that’s for wrongful death compensation not for compensating the state those people died in. 

Compare the EPA standard to things like airline compensation for fatal crashes and you get to see how wildly different the compensation is. So the State wasn’t out of its mind asking for what it asked for and the judge wasn’t out of his mind assigning what he assigned. 

The issue becomes what level of responsibility does the opioid manufacturer actually have? Yes they’re pushing their drug, but doctors are prescribing them and patients are taking them and may be taking them outside of prescription. I’m not saying they shouldn’t be held liable to some degree, but to what extend and for how many deaths is a genuine question.
$100k is considered the average? Jesus... either that was very shoddily calculated (they probably should've taken the mean, so the data is less skewed by people making millions+ a year), or I'm very poor.
Sure they are. My point was 400m for 4K issues seems reasonable.  17billion for 4K is insane
9 sexes!
$3,000 *average* per day excluding labs, medication, physician fees, etc.
I think plenty of people up high on the social ladder have a very high level of culpability, but I don't think that "well, they're not the *only* cause of the crisis" is a good justification at all for them paying less. They need to pay and it needs to be a massive amount so that the message is "stop" and not "this is just the cost of you doing business."

Weird, the amendment abolishing slavery says:

Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

Yet doesn't mention race once.

Might you be trying to make this a race issue, rather than a humanity in general issue?

I perish the thought. Out of curiosity,  what race do you think is most effected by opioid addiction?
Cool, so this helps us because it lowers our taxes?
Right, like how it's cool and ok for employers to take out life insurance on their employees.
it's the profit you generate for your employer, not what you are paid.

If that makes you feel any better.
In value generated, not the wages paid. Difference is profit.
Well I don't really have remotely the info to evaluate what appropriate damages and culpability are, that is the judge's job.  Bu I was just commenting how with things like this everyone is so eager to find a big bad corporation and lay it entirely at their feet.

As though the doctors themselves, and individuals involved don't also have some culpability.
Opium scented.
Yeah weird that the "War on Drugs" didn't start as a way to target black people supporting the civil rights movement and anti-war protesters:

>“You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or blacks, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”  
>  
>Nixon’s invention of the War on Drugs as a political tool was cynical, but every president since — Democrat and Republican alike — has found it equally useful for one reason or another. Meanwhile, the growing cost of the Drug War is now impossible to ignore: billions of dollars wasted, bloodshed in Latin America and on the streets of our own cities, and millions of lives destroyed by draconian punishment that doesn’t end at the prison gate; one of every eight black men has been disenfranchised because of a felony conviction. ([https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/](https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/))

But hey - let's not let the facts that crack carried a higher sentence than cocaine, that I grew up in the 80's during the "lock up those black people on drugs" era get in your way.  You can keep ignoring the history while those poor white pharmacists today get slapped on the wrists for being drug dealers while the poor white communities are now "victims who need treatment" compared to the "oh snap they're using marijuana in the black communities?  LOCK THEM UP.  LOCK THEM UP...." of the last forty years.
probably goes to services and paying down debt incurred to medicare/medicaid for the treatment of the children.
No, the politicians get to keep it, because reasons.
Leaders of the black community were the ones pushing for and supporting a harsher penalty for crack

The war on drugs was a response to the people protesting the Vietnam war. It was aimed at hippies, not black people. 

I could point out the rest of your completely false claims,  but i dont care enough to spend the next four hours explaining the absolute most basic of facts.

Just because youre so wrapped up in your narrative  about  race you cant see reality anymore, that doesn't mean reality changes to your whim

Edit:

By the way, its not like you can just be arrested for absolutely nothing.  If you commit a crime you will face justice regardless of race. Which, let me be  clear,  is not proven false by a sentence you think isnt harsh enough. If you aren't in possession of crack, guess what? You cant be imprisoned for possession of crack. 

White people arent your scapegoat to avoid taking personal responsibility.
Narrator: It doesn't.
That's... Not how it works...
There was the “kids for cash” scandal where a judge was caught handing out sentences to innocent kids to fill a new prison in exchange for money/kickbacks/bribery.

One of the reasons he was caught was because he got greedy and started putting away white kids. Those kids had parents that could afford lawyers and were able to get the situation investigated.  You may not think that race has anything to do with this whole system being corrupt, but you’d be naive.

And your statement about, “if you don’t possess crack, you can’t be imprisoned for crack” is also naive.  There are plenty of cases of police being caught planting evidence.  These are things that happen to people, and it happens disproportionately to people of color, or poor people of color at the least.  

If you’re really interested, watch the documentary “13th” on Netflix. It really added to my perspective.
Narrator: it sure does....
correct - the politician's spouse has to set up a consulting a company first, then the consulting company gets paid, which pays the spouse of the politician, because reasons.
Yeah, and its so far from the vast majority its irrelevant. One case of the extreme does not the rule make

It one group of people disproportionately commits crime they will be disproportionately represented in prisons, shocking i know.

This issue is much deeper than a few drug companies over selling the benefits  

**In 1999** at a was a small dinner, sitting at the table **Governor Jeb Bush with Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings, state Sen. Locke Burt and James McDonough**, who would become the state’s hard-nosed drug czar.  The dinner was to discuss a solution to big issue about to get much bigger

* the explosion of prescription painkillers.

By the time the meal ended, all had agreed on the need for establishing a prescription drug monitoring program that would collect information and track prescriptions written for controlled substances, such as oxycodone.

Absent a prescription drug monitoring database, there was no way to know whether someone was “doctor shopping,” going from doctor to doctor, getting more and more prescriptions to feed their habit.

In November, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth appeared poised to take on Purdue Pharma.  Instead, Butterworth and Purdue struck a settlement.  As part of a $2 million deal, Purdue would pay to establish a prescription monitoring database, the same silver bullet sought by Bush. After Florida’s computerized system was up and running, the same system would be free to any other state. The entire country, not just Florida, would benefit.

It could have been a groundbreaking deal.

A rising state lawmaker in 2002, now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had the clout to make or break the legislation. He had been one of two state House majority whips and was on the fast track to becoming House speaker.

Rubio didn’t kill the 2002 bill out of opposition to prescription monitoring.

**It was politics.**

-----

* Even after **doctors** are charged with illegally prescribing medicine or are linked to overdoses, the **Florida State Department of Health** doesn't automatically suspend or revoke their licenses.

*  "We failed to enact proper controls and procedures that would keep this from getting out of hand," said **Bruce Grant**, the state's former **drug czar**.

* **Florida Attorney General** Pam Bondi said. "Florida is the epicenter of the pill-mill crisis because of our lack of tough regulations and laws."

Twin Brothers Chris and Jeffrey George make $43 million from 2007-2009 from the illicit sale of oxycodone and other drugs out of their South Florida pain clinics. When patients start dying, their pill mills get unwanted attention from the Feds.

 * $4.5 million in cash was hidden by the twins’ mother in her attic.

Late in 2007, Chris George, a 27-year-old former convict with no medical training, opened his first pain pill clinic in South Florida. With no laws to stop him, George and his twin brother, Jeff, were about to become kingpins, running pills up and down I-75 — quickly dubbed “Oxy Alley.”

Their top clinic, American Pain alone prescribed almost 20 million pills over two years.

 * Inked muscle-heads ran the clinic's security. Former strippers operated the pharmacy, counting out pills and stashing cash in garbage bags. Under their lab coats, the doctors carried guns--and it was all legal... sort of.

The clinic’s top performer was a young doctor named Cynthia Cadet. During her 16-month tenure, Cadet became the No. 1 writer of scrips for oxycodone pills in the country — some days seeing more than 70 patients.

Cadet stood trial for distributing narcotics for non-medical reasons and a resultant seven deaths. In fact, Cadet alone had served 51 patients whose deaths could be linked to prescription pills.

**Cadet was found not guilty.** Her defense: How could she possibly know if patients were lying about their pain levels?

**Jury acquit 2nd former pain clinic doctor of murder**, convicts him of minor drug charge. The panel of eight women and four men deliberated about five hours before deciding to acquit Klein of murder in the Feb. 28, 2009 overdose death of Joseph Bartolucci, 24, of West Palm Beach. The jury also found Klein not guilty on nine other charges, including trafficking in the painkillers oxycodone and hydromorphone.

"The state did not prove it to me," Fuller said of the serious charges.

But the juror said the evidence was there to support a conviction of a charge called sale of alprazolam

In the end The state did convict the man behind the show of 2 crimes

Circuit Judge Joseph Marx said he had no qualms about punishing Jeff George, 35, with the maximum possible 20-year prison term in a plea deal concerning second-degree murder and drug trafficking charges.

Chris George got 14 years

In the first six months of 2010, Ohio doctors and health care practitioners bought the second-largest number of oxycodone doses in the country: Just under 1 million.

* Florida’s bought 40.8 million.

Of the country’s top 50 oxycodone-dispensing clinics, 

 * 49 were in Florida

People on both sides of the counter knew what was going on: In a letter to the chief executive of Walgreens, **Oviedo’s police chief** warned that people were walking out of the town’s two Walgreens stores and selling their drugs on the spot

-----
On average in 2011, a U.S. pharmacy bought 73,000 doses of oxycodone in a year.

* By contrast, a single **Walgreens** pharmacy in the Central Florida town of Oviedo bought 169,700 doses of oxycodone in 30 days.

a Florida **Walgreens drug distribution center** 

 * sold 2.2 million tablets to a single **Walgreens’ pharmacy** in tiny Hudson

 * In 40 days 327,100 doses of the drug were shipped to a Port Richey Walgreens pharmacy, 
  * prompting a distribution manager to ask: “How can they even house this many bottles?”

**Cardinal Health**, one of the nation’s biggest distributors, sold two **CVS pharmacies** in Sanford, FL a combined 3 million doses of oxycodone

**Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc.** was a middling-sized drug distributor selling oxycodone to Florida pharmacies.

* Oxycodone made up more than 60 percent of its drug sales in 2009 and 2010, according to federal records. Of its top 55 oxycodone customers, 44 were in Florida.

Company **CEO Dennis Smith** worried that the Florida-bound oxycodone was getting in the wrong hands. A trip to Broward did nothing to ease his mind. “It was,” he later testified, “the Wild West of oxycodone prescribing.”

* Smith stopped selling to pain clinics.

  * But the company continued to shovel millions of oxycodone pills to Florida pharmacies.

**Tru-Valu Drugs** It had been in business for 43 years. The owner and head pharmacist had been there for 32. It had shaded parking and a downtown location, a stone’s throw from the City Hall Annex.

 * Of the 300,000 doses of all drugs the small pharmacy dispensed in December 2008, 192,000 were for oxycodone.  The huge oxycodone volume was no accident. **The owner and head pharmacist**, told a Masters inspector that the pharmacy “has pushed for this (narcotic) business with many of the area pain doctors.”

----
There was a culture of customers that knew what to do to get what they wanted 


* Teenage high-school wrestling buddies in New Port Richey ran oxycodone into Tennessee; they were paid with cash hidden in teddy bears. 

* A Hillsborough County man mailed 17,000 pills to Glen Fork, W.Va., a month’s supply for every man woman and child in the tiny town.

* A Boston Chinatown crime boss trafficked pills from Sunrise into Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and South Carolina. 

* At Palm Beach International Airport, two federal security agents accepted $500 a pop each time they waved through thousands of pills bound for Connecticut and New York.

* A Palm Bay man’s Puerto Rican family bought local pills destined for the working class town of Holyoke, Mass. 

* In Rhode Island, police pulled over a Lauderhill man caught speeding through Providence. They found 903 oxycodone tablets and 56 morphine pills in the car.

* Senior citizen and Tulane business graduate Joel Shumrak funneled more than 1 million pills into eastern Kentucky from his South Florida and Georgia clinics, much of it headed for street sales — an estimated 20 percent of the illicit oxycodone in the entire state.

* Van loads of pill-seekers organized by “VIP buyers” traveled from Columbus, Ohio, to three Jacksonville clinics, where armed guards handled crowd control and doctors generated prescriptions totaling 3.2 million pills in six months

* Kenneth Hammond didn’t make it back to his Knoxville, Tenn., home. He had a seizure after picking up prescriptions for 540 pills and died in an Ocala gas station parking lot.

* Matthew Koutouzis drove from Toms River, N.J., to see Averill in her Broward County pain clinic. The 26-year-old collected prescriptions for 390 pills and overdosed two days later. 

* Brian Moore traveled 13 hours from his Laurel County, Ky., home to see Averill. He left with prescriptions for 600 pills and also overdosed within 48 hours

* Keith Konkol didn’t make it back to Tennessee, either. His body was dumped on the side of a remote South Carolina road after he overdosed in the back seat of a car the same day of his clinic visit. He had collected eight prescriptions totaling 720 doses of oxycodone, methadone, Soma and Xanax.
I never even heard about J&J being involved with the opiod crisis. Last thing I heard about them was the Aesbestos in baby powder lawsuit.

Sucks to keep seeing how deep this Opiod Crisis rabbit hole goes. Strange thing is how I rarely see it being covered on the news which if I'm being honest is really creepy.
How about a lawsuit for their 'No tears' claim on their shampoos, too?  I'm beginning to think this company is evil
I don’t understand how all this ended up preventing a legitimate hip pain patient from getting decent pain relief. That is the next crime: a generation with unresolved pain and suffering because of misuse by a bunch of idiots
Bold move. 

Accountability may be a start to healing this epidemic.
Corporate greed in America knows no end. It’s like there’s two different planes of reality for these people. There is no world outside of the company. Sickening.
Off Topic; It makes me wonder if they covered up Casey Johnson's death and blamed it on her diabetes (the Johnson & Johnson Heiress).

She died apparently due to untreated diabetes. But at the time of her death, she lived in squalor, had all kinds of issues with (prescription) drugs and why did her family make her friends go to her house to remove her dogs....*and* a [box of her insulin needles](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1241101/Tragic-heiress-Casey-Johnson-died-squalid-rat-invested-slum-water-electricity.html)? I assume if she was struggling financially she couldn't access her insulin - but her family says she had an insulin pump. The article also mentions her family cut her off unless she agreed to go to rehab to get help for drug addiction. So, manipulating the opioid epidemic, and then the heiress dies from a drug over dose because they used tough love. That's probably not going to look good.
This is all the result from the war on drugs. It's been a failure since it started. People who want to use are going to use, no matter what. I've done my fair share, got into intrveinal at the end of a 10 year opiate binge. I was shooting everything from stimulants to downers. There was a time you could have sold me a sack of rat poison and it would have been injected into my arm with no caution at all.  I should be dead, i have no veins, my body is wrecked.  Users need a safe place to purchase and do their drugs. Where needles and other drug items can be properly disposed. This whole, "if your an addict, then you are a criminal" is bullshit. Over populating our institutions and prisons. We need drug reform soon, or we will continue going down this path
Um, how about revoking the licenses of the doctors WRITING ALL THE BOGUS PRESCRIPTIONS!
Good luck. I have a feelings this will be appealed so many times the only winners will be the lawyers and nothing changes.
but somehow weed is a worse drug.
Okay, so the pharmaceutical companies lobbied politics, doctors and to some extent even the patients. What else is new?

While those companies certainly are somewhat to blame, I generally have a few issues with the whole thing. Scapegoating may be the wrong expression but I do feel it's like going after the easy target only. This whole thing goes a lot deeper but of course solving those issues would take actual work:

1. Why are there no state- or better nationwide systems that register opioid prescriptions? It shouldn't be possible to overprescribe so significantly in a functioning system.

2. What is wrong with the doctors? Who in his right mind prescribes fistfuls of opiates for a wisdom tooth removal (apart from some rare, complicated cases)? Sure, the pharma sales rep may have said a lot of things but they're medical professionals, it is their job to look through sales talk to some extent and that definitely covers not handing out those kinds of painkillers like candy. It's not exactly news that opiates are fairly addictive and should be proscribed with caution and only when warranted. 

3. To a significantly lesser extent the patients themselves. It is one thing if a doctor gives the patient very clear instructions how to use a particular drug, of course the patient should generally stick to that. However, that typically doesn't seem to be the case and even if people don't know what they're taking, if a painkiller gets me sky high I just might read up on what it actually is.

I'm not trying to defend the pharma companies, quite the contrary, but I find that a lot of people are ignoring an even more significant part of the problem. "Muh, big corporation bad". Possibly. Likely. That doesn't mean that others can do no wrong.
> Johnson & Johnson hired the consultants McKinsey & Company to identify opportunities to sell more. McKinsey recommended sales reps focus on doctors already prescribing large amounts of OxyContin. McKinsey also proposed a strategy to keep patients on Duragesic even if they had an “adverse event”. The broader push was to get as many patients as possible off of lower strength opioids and on to Johnson & Johnson’s more powerful drugs. 

&#x200B;

Holy shit, that's what they're doing with my money after I buy band-aids? I didn't even know they made drugs.
Just an example of the sad state of us medical reform. I had surgery and my prescription for 15 prescription meds was under $5 or if pocket. My antibiotics to help kill the current infection and present new post surgery infection cost over $300 of pocket. Thankfully me health plan covered it but what if it didn't???? I can get really high to numb the fact the the government is letting people die with the current regulations.
This is going too far. Suing Johnson I can understand, but to sue the other Johnson as well? Too much
The joint commission named pain the 5th vital sign in 2001. I’m a nurse, I can assure you pain is not a vital sign. If your heart rate is 250 or 25 you could die. If your respiratory rate is 1 or 60 you could die. If your temp is 80 or 106 you could die. And, if your blood pressure is 250/150 or not palpable, you could die. “Vital” means life. You don’t die from pain. A 10/10 or 20/10 pain does not kill you. You can die from the things that could be causing pain, but pain itself does not kill you.  I’m pissed off at the nursing powers that be that made it imperative for us to manage and monitor pain the way we do, and call it a vital sign. They are also part of this problem and they should own up to it. They still teach it in nursing schools even after we have seen so much damage from this opioid crisis, they should be ashamed of themselves.
Im tired of allowing doctors to shake the blame elsewhere.  They KNOWINGLY allowed drug sales reps into their offices with free samples, gifts, kickbacks, etc.  There are hundreds of drugs to prescribe and it's THEIR JOB to decide which is best for each patient.  The idea that we let them blame others for their medical descisions that they apparently made on the word of a salesman is absurd.  If it really wasnt their medical expertise that made them prescribe such a thing I call that fraud for money.  The sales rep isnt a fucking doctor.  What do they go to school for if its not their choice??
As the police in that state lazily refuse to act when you call different agencies directly in order to report abuse of script pads.
The real issue is accountability. 

| Party | Action |
| :--: | :--: |
| Drug Company | Develops the most potent pain-management Medication |
| Doctors | Prescribes the Medication | 
| Patient | Relieved of intense pain | 

And here's the dark side of it:

| Party | Action |
| :--: | :--: |
| Drug Company | Makes most powerful opioid ever. Compensates doctors to push it. |
| Doctors | Over prescribes the drug to people who don't really need it. | 
| Addict | Continues their dangerous addiction. Goes through means to get more. | 

So who does accountability fall upon?

* The Pharma who made the drug and pushed it? 

* The Doctor eager to over prescribe and get compensated?

* The addict for taking it/going through means to acquire?


There is a substantial basis for the fentanyl family of drugs, a viable use for people who are in pain. This typically gets prescribed in end of life care. People think you could just prescribe more morphine. That is simply not the case. You would eventually get to a point where you're prescribing ridiculous amounts of morphine and it's effectiveness is diminished over smaller units of stronger painkillers.
I wonder how the payout will affect the lives of the people that the drugs have destroyed. I'm sure that some rehabs can be opened, money set aside for education on addiction, etc. But what I am talking about is at the personal level. I personally know people that have had their lives destroyed by addiction that started in a dr's office and it's a story that can be repeated all over the country. They were told it was unlikely to develop an addiction. They were given absolutely no support when it was time to stop taking them. They weren't weaned. They were told nothing except that they could no longer have this prescription that they had been given for months. So now all of a sudden they are in withdrawals. It's pretty hard to go to work when you have no sleep from leg cramps and explosive diarrhea. They have two choices. Not go to work or find someone that get them some pills. So they find some pills and can function at work but now they are going into debt because it's so expensive to buy pills off the street. Some people struggle through this part for years. They end up losing everything because they try to keep that sickness away but it never lasts and they have to keep chasing. They get pulled over for speeding and the cop sees a pill in the car or search them and find a pocket full. Now they go to jail and have a record. Lose their job. Now they can't afford to buy the pills and theres no way they can afford rehab. So they get a hold of some heroin. Now what? Someone brings a lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company for a shit ton of money. That's cool.
My body picked a bad time to get crps lol. Currently live on painkillers
Good work from the Oklahomies
It's amazing how a bright Red "Personal Responsibility" state, has no problem blaming it all on Johnson and Johnson. Their own crooked politicians took immense bribes to look the other way, and are now pulling a "Hey look over there" scam.
From my understanding ( which is limited to catching 30% of the story a few times on the news) , they played a more minor part in the crisis compared to a few other companies like Perdue. By no means am I saying they are off the hook, but I thought there role was a lot more minor in the epidemic.
The benefit of not having Scott Pruitt as your AG anymore...
More importantly, will this make them sell the Jets?
Cutting people off their relatively safe painkillers is often what causes them to try heroin for the first time. Just saying.
70% of Americans are overweight or obese. So clearly the vast majority of Americans don’t put much personal responsibility into their own health.

With that in mind, why is that same overweight demographic so quick to point out the irresponsibility in others? If 70% of the population is abusing food to the detriment of their bodies, who’s to say that same population wouldn’t continue abusing opioids the same regardless of if all these companies had acted above board?

It’s not like you have a population of healthy, active people who take personal responsibility for their health stirring up this outrage.

But this will go against 70% of the population so naturally an unfavorable, but not unsound, opinion.
Come on J&J make some bureaucrats rich again.
Good luck.   Conservative judges are notoriously pro-corporate.    Gorsuch said the ice road trucker should have died rather than abandon his load.
Weird to see the state of Oklahoma do something that makes sense for once.
[deleted]
My fiancé has her tonsils removed...she was prescribed 60....60 fucking Norco. Like, is fucking 60 really necessary?? It’s an addiction in a bottle right there...
Cool now will any of this money that they get go towards helping these people that are addicted get better? No of course not why would a decent human being do that
I hope this takes down Chris and Woody Johnson and puts them in the poorhouse, forcing them to sell the New York Jets allowing the team to actually be successful.
How do companies like the makers of Suboxone fit into this? I was addicted to heroin and fentanyl for years and the only way I was able to stop was through Suboxone treatment. That stuff really does work and I thought there was no way I'd be able to get off the dope.

So, they seem to be profiting wildly off the epidemic, but actually have a good product. If I have to be on it the rest of my life,so be it. It's a way better alternative than shooting up.

I do know tons of other patients just sell their Suboxone or use it as a backup in case they can't score dope. And for someone that has no tolerance to opiates,Suboxone will get you extremely high. 

They obviously benefit off the crisis, i have no desire to ever stop taking it, but it's gotten me to stop using dope and fent and actually enabled me to live somewhat of a normal life.
Posicute one CEO for murder and write a law to serve death penalty for the crime of greed!
I had a double mastectomy and received Dilaudid in hospital. Next day home without anything because I'm successfully treated,  - without increase in mgs for 15 yrs - pain treatment patient. Try walking to the toilet with bags sewn into your skin weighted by fluid and tissue drainage without break through meds. It's gone too far when the successfully treated pts who've never come up short or failed a urine test or med count get to leave without short acting pain meds. I have a real problem with junkies, I'm pissed at the addicts, and the freaked out legislators worried for their campaign contributions! Sorry addicts/junkies, truly.
At what point to veterans get there share? The VA has done nothing but throw pills at my issues since day one. I barely survived my addiction let alone the number of vets that die from it. Shit pisses me off because the VA is still trying to put me on pills.
Pamper your infants so they can grow to be good little addicts
This is bullshit. Where was the outrage when crack was brought in by the govt. and destroyed lower income communities all across the U.S.? No one sued the govt to get compensation.
Taking their money is great, but I want to see prison time for these padded cunts.
[deleted]
There is. o opioids crisis. There is a people wanting to get and stay high crisis. And why shouldn’t they get high and stay high? There’s no stopping it. Legalize all drugs now.
Well I guess that explains their new ad campaign that I've been seeing in every other ad break on TV
I went to HS in Oklahoma in the late 00's and xanax, loratabs, oxy's and the like were very easily attainable and commonly taken at parties with alcohol. I knew a kid who sold the pills he got from his girlfriends arthritis (she was ridiculously overprescribed at 16) on the side, and made enough money to buy a new dodge ram.
Baby Powder? Fuck you and shove your ::headline:: up your ass Mr. queen-doppelpoplis
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscious
J&J also got the big Spravato endorsement for Trump admin. Spravato was beaten by the placebo in the testing stage. Bravo to all.
If anyone is interested. My brother a couple years ago did his senior thesis on the over prescription of painkillers.
No mention at all what OK would do with the billions of it wins.  The article takes on a prosecutorial stance against JnJ.  The perspective being that JnJ is already guilty.

How about OK have to use every cent towards treating pain addiction instead of whatever pet projects a cash windfall would enable.
After watching alot of ['Snowfall'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowfall_(TV_series) and recently seeing ['American Made'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(film), I got to wondering how the government would allow all that money to be made, and not get their cut..?..


Perhaps we just found one of the avenues?
Please include any and every of the white collar manufacturers, doctors, scientists and politicians and all else who have and continue to support this mess. 

Maybe they should trade places with those who are in jail because of them🧐
and..........no tears my ass!
It happens over and over it’s like deja vu and when you see it happening to someone you care about they won’t listen and they have their own deal made in their head it just sucks.
Johnson and Johnson, an opioid company.
Do you have any idea how many people **Ford motor company** have murdered? Don't even get me started.

Actually, the state department is complicit, they made the roads!!!
Some needs prison time over this shit and it's not the victims
Good. Young lives, old lives, sons, fathers,  daughters, mother's. So many lives ruined to lined some pockets bring them the fuck down
But they're a FAMILY company!
Part of me wants to see the Johnson & Johnson CEO go to court dressed at Tony Montana.
I cannot wait for all those involved to receive a few thousand dollar fine, a few months in prison, and a few months of community service!
Yes!! Take them down! I love to see justice being sought out against big corrupt companies! A loved one of mine developed tumors on their chest because of a pharmaceutical J&J produced. Lawsuit ensued and ongoing. Fuck Johnson &Johnson. I dont know how they are still in stores when its proven their products are more harmful than helpful.
And they will sadly lose. Obviously.
#1J&J-a FAMILY COMPANY :(
From this [blog post](https://ndworkblog.wordpress.com/2019/05/22/opioids-marijuana-and-psilocybin/): The nation is embracing new drugs with benefits that have significant risks and rejecting another drug with benefits that has significant risks.
Even if they won, where would the money go? More likely a deal for less money or slap on wrist kind. They just got to lobby with more money and give gov a cut through fine. 

Corporations with lawyers can drag this for decades.

Good for Oklahoma PR though.
Drop in the bucket.  Somewhere in a shareholders meeting they're laughing their ass off, like this is it??
But fracking is cool. OK has their priorities.
How is this any different than suing gun manufacturers for their part in driving gun sales and lobbying in our country’s gun epidemic?
Isnt J and J a very small player in this market compared to Purdue?
Oh for heaven's sake, whatever happened to personal responsibility? It's the drug company for making something that's helpful for legitimate patients that gets abused by others? I remember the first time (back in the late 1990s) I went to the drugstore to get some Sudafed. (Mind you, I'd been to an ENT in 1979 who'd given me a prescription for Sudafed (which was Rx-only at the time) with 10 refills to treat my chronic sinusitis. I've been taking Sudafed twice a day since then just so I can breathe through my nose.) The shelves where Sudafed had previously been stocked  were now filled with tiny signs saying "Please see the pharmacist." Just because some geniuses discovered how to make meth out of it I have to stand in line to actually show my ID to the pharmacist each time some Sudafed and can only buy one package at a time.

&#x200B;

I've suffered from Lupus and collateral conditions (arthritis, Sjogren's Syndrome, etc) since 1989, and it wasn't until the last 10 years that everything conspired to make me ache severely and regularly. My rheumatologist used to prescribe Hydrocodone (one script of 60 pills would last me a little over three months....I only took it when flares got very, very bad. But now my rheumatologist refuses to prescribe it due to all the DEA regulations and possible legal consequences. And suddenly Gabapentin (which he prescribed instead to help with my sciatica pain) has become now one of those "no refills, must contact your physician", apparently because of similar abuse....

&#x200B;

Why has no one sued any of the major liquor distilleries because their loved one became an alcoholic?
This is such bullshit. The opioid crisis isnt the drug  makers fault. People are dropping  like flies because this  moronic government  cracking down on pain management which provide it in a safe exactly measured dose which then forces people that need the pain relief (or recreationial use) to switch to trying to buy it off the streets either via fake pills or heroin which often contain fentanyl and then die. Lets call it what is it is, this stupid government tryng to double down on its obviously very unsuccessful drug war and  continuing to  put the money and ball in the courts of the scumbag fentanyl dealers.
It’s about time these companies are held accountable.
What on earth did they do?! Dont they make paper towels and similar products?
I think they should literally get a taste of their own medicine
Great. After all, what right do people in pain have to relief from pain. LET THEM HURT!
Anyone notice there’s been an uprising in the justice system recently? Human trafficking rings are being taken down, rapists and sexual offenders are getting called out, elite companies are getting outed for their corruption. My hopes for this year was low but I forgot there are still a lot of good people out there. Nice.
Life sucks and then you die is driving the opioid crisis.
Good... it seems like that's the only way to stop them... Drain their fucking pockets... put them outta business.
And then Oklahoma is gunna use that money to get "high AF" on meth.
Blame the drug companies and the docs that took their money and rx whatever they are told to
I think we’re mostly missing the mark on these cases, and while making drug companies pay might help to some extent, it does nothing to change the fundamentals of why we got here. 

> A senior Johnson & Johnson marketing executive, Kimberly Deem-Eshleman, defended the sales strategy as reps “educating” doctors.

_No_.  Your sales strategy is to _sell_. Your reps are sales reps. 

I think that and the lack of transparency about pharma research are the biggest issues, but I also can’t forgive individual doctors who, after years or even decades of formal science education, either can’t think critically enough or are too greedy to spot or care about a lack of real evidence vs. a sales pitch.
How is a company in a capitalist society going to be held accountable for selling legal things?

I understand very little about this persecution and as a decent redditor refuse to read the article.
Yet people that legit need them have to jump thru hoops to get them. They have been an absolute life changer for people with severe pain.
Fuck all the Johnsons
And I am dependent on coffee but addicted to nicotine. I choose nicotine over oatmeal for a week!
But.. but.. but.. they’re a family company...
Somebody in New York completely flooded the state with roxycodone the last 8-10 months, sometime around December I believe. I was able to pick up 30mgs for $20/pop and some dudes were offering me deals of up to 100+pills.

Been 63 days clean off opioids, never going back, still see people dying every week of fentanyl-laced heroin and roxycodone.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just would like to say to older/former drug users here saying that oxycodone doesnt exist in the US and its all laced or fake or u4000 or some opioid research chemical; I've studied and taken drugs on the street and only for 5 years. I may of been a teenager through it but my research was extensive and I Was very careful. The people that told me in real life that I couldn't ever get oxy were the same people telling me I would never find a real bar of xanax, yet my friends mom is prescribed G3 2mg Xanax bars that I used to acquire the entire script for $200. I used to get vicodins from my ex-girlfriends corrupt ass doctor, who prescribed 30 5mgs monthly for her nerve damage (along with gabapentin, which I was also addicted too). Many times I had to go to the street and search for these drugs, using test kits and making sure they aren't fentanyl.

&#x200B;

I had an amazing track record and not ONCE did I get a fake drug or a chemical not as advertised, and I once bought ketamine online that arrived unlabeled and I still snorted the whole bag. Sorry for the lengthy explanation I'm just not replying to another "You never did oxycodone, you did fentanyl" comment. While I am **not claiming pills aren't pressed,** I have had a very lucky track record.
Florida was responding to a demand created by the illicit sales by Pharmaceutical Distributors. The opioid crisis started in the 90s, and what happened in Florida is a trailing-indicator, not a leading one.

I'm not trying to dispute your facts, but I sold drugs from 1997 until 2014 in Philadelphia, and the Doctor-shoppers are just poor people responding to Market Incentives.

The only difference between Florida and Pennsylvania is that Florida's lax regulations made illicit sales unnecessary In and Around Florida.

The demand was literally created out of nowhere in the late 90s, a full decade before the Florida pill mills.

Blaming doctors and small-town pharmacies has been the industry's game for over 2 decades, but it's just not mathematically possible to explain the BILLIONS of pills consumed with millions of prescriptions.

There is an order of magnitude between what's been produced, and what's been legally distributed over the last 25 years, and until the RICO statute is applied and WEALTHY people go to jail, there's simply no way of knowing how many, exactly.
...and yet Marijuana is a schedule 1 drug and we've filled up prisons with its users and sellers.

Meanwhile, these pain pills are schedule 2, and we largely treat the sellers as respected businesses and the users as victims.
How do you have such a long, detailed timeline of the opioid crisis and only mention Purdue Pharmaceutical in passing. Everything you said, dirty politicians, fake doctors, drug kingpins, addicts doctor shopping and dying are symptoms. Purdue Pharmaceutical is the cancer that metastasized throughout this country.

America likes its drugs. It wants access to drugs and other medicine. Parts of the country have already defacto decriminalized hard substances. 

The war on drugs have lost, drugs are just to good to control in such a haphazard manner, with even the state allowing cartels to sell their substances while turning a blind eye if it suits them.
Wait so what did Rubio do? Seemed like that part wasn’t very detailed
What a huge post with not a single source for it
Thanks Marco, you sellout douche. Florida could have actually been known for something good for once and you went and fucked that up. This is why we can’t have nice things.
Whoa whoa, gonna double check this but if this is all true I'm more disgusted with the system than I thought possible. My sister's death is almost certainly because of this wild West pill prescribing and while I knew it was a thing I had no idea it was so big and so obvious. The number of red flags this sort of thing should have set off over the years, wait correction, Did set off over the years and no one did anything? Or were so many people silenced or disappeared? I... Can't...
Having family and friends who’ve OD’d on this shit, people who distribute opioids outside of regulated medical purposes need to endure the full penalties. Florida needs to get its shit together and charge bad doctors. I’m all for legalizing drugs, but opioids are a different animal. I also think people affected should embrace [class action suits](https://nlginjury.com/dorchester-medical-malpractice-lawyer/prescription-drug-errors/) against these major companies for [poorly prescribed medication](https://nlginjury.com/dorchester-dangerous-drugs-lawyer/). No company making this much money is going to give up easily, they must be hit on all fronts to stop their business. If people in Texas can be charged up to 99 years in prison for [drug possession/distribution](https://thetexaslawdog.com/fort-worth-drug-lawyer/), then these people should get that *and* [conspiracy](https://thetexaslawdog.com/fort-worth-conspiracy-lawyer/) for continuing this.
This was interesting, but formatted like a seizure.
In addition to your facts, it’s also important to point out that the CDC around that time introduced “pain as a fifth vital sign,” which was a movement aimed at providing pain relief for patients that was supposed to “beat the pain.” This led to many hospital-admitted patients receiving ridiculous amounts of opioids and kicking off many peoples’ spirals into addiction. I believe the CDC did this with lobbying/string pulling, but I’m not 100% sure.

All I can think of is https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wUMt9xYkIe8 "it's just good business"

The registration would be a great boon in some parts but a big issue is how to knock down these businesses to size. Can't really jail the shareholders and if I remember correctly, Purdue made more money in 2017 than all of the lawsuit against them combined. Also this snowball is huge, even if we got something done today we wouldn't see results for years because the slow moving goliath of the US government. By all means we have to fix this nonsense but I am still at a loss as to where to start. Suing is not a reasonable option, money may not go where needed (the tobacco lawsuit) or may not damage them to badly to force change; a corporation as a person is hard to finagle non financial punishment.

I am all ears, a registry is a fantastic way to curb the individuals. If you have a (preferably free) sources/studies for suggestions that is always welcome.
This is one of the best comments I have ever seen on Reddit. Sources would make it hands down the absolute best.

This is the part I don't understand. The drug companies aren't the majority of the problem. They're absolutely marketing these drugs to docs etc to get more scripts but in the end they just make the drugs, they're not prescribing them or dispensing them to patients. They're getting sued because they have money and that's the ONLY reason.  They'll probably settle anyways and barely any of that money will make it to any type of fund that will help resolve this problem. It's a serious problem it's just sad that we resort to suing the group with the most money rather than sitting down and saying, this clinic wrote 150% more scripts last month than anywhere else in the state. Maybe we should take a look. Those scripts are tracked. Follow the numbers.
Where does this information come from?

Edit: If true, which I'm inclined to believe so, then these are many of the same people who have been responsible in direct and round-about ways for locking people in cages for smoking cannabis and snorting cocaine and eating mushrooms, etc... That sort of cowardly hypocrisy (and, ya know, *law breaking, flouting*) deserves more jail time than a little ganja in the lungs.
I’m just glad these companies made big profits/s
This is extremely important. I had no idea. Everyone should be aware of this.
Is there a documentary talking about all this? If not, there should be.
Florida was crazy, drug dealers here in WV would load planes up with people and fly them to FL to load up on oxys. There were pharmacies in the doctors offices.
It's funny you mention that "This issue is much deeper than a few drug companies over selling the benefits", and then proceed to describe all the "surface-level" crime surrounding these drugs.
My little brother has crashed multiple cars passing out while ODing on Oxycontin/Oxycodone. Ive seen this shit too real. Yes this was in Florida.
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2170061/

Watch this.  It was done in  2009.  They were chased by those muscle heads in Fla.
This really brought me to tears. I was an iv addict before I graduated high school(oxys). And before I truly knew what an addict was. When that ran out we turned to heroin. I’m still fucked 15 yrs later really. I don’t blame anyone but my choices for this, but this comment really makes me want this shit to stop. Of course I knew there is an opioid crisis. But this makes me really want changes to happen. It’s crazy to read how people in real pain can’t get help. and others are over dosing in parking lots. This mess is heartbreaking. I don’t even know why I’m still alive. Iv od’ed so many times. This shit is seriously a crisis. Damn.
That was a great read thank you,
The question becomes: what do you want drug companies to have done differently.

- they don't sell to patients
- they don't even sell to pharmacies
- they sell to distributors
- who sell to pharmacies
- who sell to patients with a prescription

A drug company had better not limit sales to distributors.

After the last time, in the late 1990s that the government mistakenly blamed the manufacturer for patients overdosing:

- they put in time-release to stop addiction and abuse
- they report all sales to the government

The **government**, armed with this information is the one who is then supposed to do some investigating.

This pharmacy selling 20 times the average? You damn well better **not** limit sales to that distributor. You damn well better **not** start wanting copies of private medical records.
Do you have any sources for this? Compelling story but without sources this reads like a /r/conspiracy post.
 Holy shit, this sounds like Cocaine Cowboys 3.0.
> Cardinal Health

Nice, nice.

Last time I worked at Ohio State University Airport, about two years ago, Cardinal Health housed two Falcon 2000 private jets and at least one other plane there. They fly them multiple times a week.
Oklahoma also settled with Purdue around the time OK v J&J went to trial, but I’m not sure about the exact timeline
Johnson and Johnson net worth is estimated at $360,000,000,000 -  being sued for $5 billion is the equivalent to 1.4%.  

That would be like it a guy with net worth of  $100,000 is sued for $1,400 for causing the opioid epidemic.
TLDR what about the stocks did they go up?

Having dabbled in the pill scene in FL during the pill mill era, the doctors were a complete joke. Random office parks, fake documents, tons of sketchy people who were obviously not in pain.  Always right next to some independent pharmacy (because CVS and Wags outright stop filling scripts).  One of them I remember was so sleazy, I was sure he was accepting BJs or something for scripts.  They did not give a fuck as long as you paid.  Pill mills died here mostly because suppliers stopped shipping to FL and a massive shortage of meds ensued.  So even if you got a legit script, youd have nowhere to fill it.  At least it was this way around 2011 or so.
I'd like to add, that "claimed" as in...

>claimed 400,000 lives 

...is highly subjective. They use "claimed" as in deaths. Multiple millions have been **adversely affected**. Family. Friends. Entire communities lay in virtual ruin. A deeply scarred generation. Sometimes, during an epidemic, the ones who die fair better than those left alive.

*formatting
Good lord this reads like a fucking horror movie script.
As someone dealing with pain meds, this shit ain't right. Doctors push them on you, and the first time the pain stops for a bit, they have a new lifetime customer. Chronic pain patients in this country are about to be fucked.
I thought my area was bad......

What pisses me off the most is that local police are paying for narcan. 

The same company that makes the narcan makes the opioid pills.  Now all the pds are paying for it, doing extra paperwork to make sure that we take care of it properly.  

But if you're an addict they hand it out like candy.

Last over dose I was on.  I use my narcan.....saved him.....yay I guess.  While on scene I find 20 other narcans that hand been handed out.  Still in the package.  No one had the brains to use it on the guy.    But they threw him in the tub with a bunch of ice.

It's getting old.
All you need is alligators and meth, and you just described how Florida operates
The book “American Pain” is fascinating and infuriating at the same time
The real issue is the government fucked up and now is just scapegoating everyone it can.

The government is 100% responsible for the mass fentanyl on the streets simply because they are not allowing softer alternatives to be sold, even to people with addiction. They are keeping demand open and those organized groups will get more and more powerful.

I wonder who they will scapegoat when fentanyl is used in mass terror plots
Purdue Pharma is the real culprit but JnJ has the $$$$
Greedy lawyers have smelled whale blood in the water, and the sharks are circling...
I was told in cosmetology school that the no tears shampoo is referring to no eye tears and it is formulated for babies and children only bc their ph levels are different from adults, that's why it burns adults but not children.

But I went to a shit cosmetology school so take it as you will.
These causes are all well and good, but what about their baby powder causing cancer on my taint?
[No more tears - Family Guy](https://youtu.be/GQfSLnRE2Fg)
"No Tears" refers to brushing/combing after use, aka no knots.

edit - so I googled it and looked into all of the sources and also looked at my daughter's bottle in the bathroom and I have to admit that I am absolutely incorrect and I deserve the chastising that I have been receiving.
Hey, what more do you want? They **stopped putting formaldehyde in their baby shampoo** back in 2014!
if you want no tears for an adult try Ever Pure by L'Oreal. It's sufate free, parben free and free of salts. I use the sunflower one and Ive noticed it doesn't sting when it gets in my eyes, and i have a lot of hair....obviously gluten free/ vegan too....

it should be in any grocery store with the hair products
how could you ever say that! they're a "family company" and clearly care about the consumer /s
Funny story, I went in for a random drug test and physical 4 days after surgery. I was prescribed 8 pills to take as needed. When the doctor asked what I was taking and I told her she looked at me like I was a babysitter that od'd while watching her children and made some remark. The bottle had 7 pills left in it.
I wouldn’t say you’re an idiot for getting hooked on opiates.. at least if it happened years ago before the opioid crisis really came to the surface. You go to the doctor bc your in pain or had surgery and they write you a prescription for pain medicine and don’t explain the dangers in detail. Opioids are incredibly addicting so it’s easy for people to begin to develop a dependence after being overprescribed drugs from someone they should be able to trust.

A lot of those shitty doctors actually tailored their scripts to make them more addictive so people would keep coming back
I think it’s disgusting how legitimate pain patients are treated.
Opioids are something that should’ve never become an epidemic. This is what happens when profits outweigh a sense of humanity. They should be held partially accountable for encouraging [medical malpractice](https://kopflerhermann.com/houma-medical-malpractice-lawyer/) resulting in [catastrophic injury](https://kopflerhermann.com/houma-catastrophic-injury-lawyer/).
There is no healing, the damage is done.  Where is the remuneration going to be for my mother being gaslit by her doctors and the "industry" for twenty years? Where is the version of my mother who wasn't given superfluous pain meds by a doctor that was arrested 15 years too late for selling pills on the street and also over-prescribing to gullible idiots like my mother? We can sit and victim blame all day, but opiates destroying your brain chemistry isn't a mystery. She is a husk of her former self and doesn't even realize it, doesn't even consider that the "doctors' did her dirty. I can show her documentary after documentary, expose after expose, but she still thinks there was nothing wrong with her use of opioids for so many years.

Fuck this whole "lets sue them thirty years after the crimes are done."  The bodies are cold.  The families are broken.  The people are abandoned and ignorant of their own abuse.

Start healing this epidemic.  What a crock.  The epidemic will only end when these things aren't manufacturated and all the addicts are dead.  I'm not saying reform and recovery aren't possible, but this is like saying Bush's "mission accomplished" speech would start healing the hearts of all those mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of those boys who died in the war. OOOOOK.
So the AG has already settled with 2 companies for a total of around 300 million. After the 200 million settlement where the money would go to build a brand spanking new Recovery center to be operated by Oklahoma State University (with what money?) the legislature and governor got together and said, "whoa. you can't decide how the state spend's its money, that's our job"

Kind of interesting to see the inherent power struggle manifest once you start talking about real money.
Corporations have neither bodied to jail nor souls to damn and therefore do as they please. The problem is that Americans have come to almost deify them.
And it won’t stop until there are few people who hold all the wealth, while millions of us remain in poverty. You might say we are there now, but things can and will get much worse. Capitalism is fundamentally flawed.
I'm play devil advocate here and say that if some one is truly opioid addicted have them get it from a prescription is 100% better then any street substance, while over perscpition is a problem there is a much larger problem if people not getting laced drug and subsequently getting addicted/overdosing. Like realistically only 10% of people prescribed opioids transition to being addicted and that doesn't take into consideration how many had used drugs prior or the conditions those people where when taking the drug.

At the end of the day most doctors are not trying to hurt people, most aren't even trying to get extra money, the opioid crisis is alot more multifaceted then that.
I was prescribed a stupid amount of opioids after getting my wisdom teeth out. Didn't take a single pill. **Just because a doctor writes you an opioid prescription doesn't mean you have to fill it.** Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Obviously I'm an outlier but I believe it's not 100% the doctors fault.

edit: Wow a lot of people can't accept the fact that **no one forced anyone to take these pills**. Doctors have been taking bribes and kick backs for years to prescribe opioids. The harsh reality is they don't deserve the benefit of the doubt anymore. Research what you put into your body people.
Or how about going after the joint commission for including pain as a “5th vital sign” and basing hospital funding off of pt’s reported pain control. 

When I was a floor nurse, in psychiatry (where all my pts were required to be medically cleared first), I was expected to ask about pain every 4 hrs. For anyone who endorsed any pain whatsoever, I then had to do 1 hr pain re-assessment and prove I was doing interventions such as medication administration. This was all heavily audited because as soon as pts are discharged, they receive a survey asking how well their pain was controlled and if they score the hospital as poor, the hospital loses funding. 

Some people aren’t the brightest bulbs and expect to have 0 pain after surgeries and major medical problems. So what do you do as a physician who has hospital administrators threatening your livelihood because your post-op pt is in pain and you’ve been told time and time again that pain is subjective and if a patient is in 10/10 pain they absolutely are? Well maybe you write for the narcotics. 

There are some shady doctors like those ones in Florida who deserve prosecution, but there’s also a whole industry that pushed good doctors to believe these pills were safe and necessary in all cases.

Interestingly enough, my patients with chronic pain who tell me they are at a 9/10 pain would almost always decline intervention, “I live at this level. I’ll let you know when it gets worse.” It sucks these people don’t get adequate relief when they need it.
Worse because they can’t make as much money off of it

That was my first thought, the people of Oklahoma should sue the state for doing nothing to mitigate the crisis. Fuck the Oklahoma state government.
It seems like they are targeting companies with a lot of money when the system worked exactly like it was supposed to. When healthcare is set up to make a profit this is what happens.
[deleted]
I agree. Toll roads are a scam.
Oklahoma has settled two lawsuits so far with other manufacturers of opioids. The Purdue settlement mostly went to establishing a new foundation for research and treatment for addiction. The other settlement has to go to the general fund due to a change in state law so we will see where the money ends up.
Don’t forget the denial of healthcare for the Oklahoma National Guard service members because she didn’t want to have to pay insurance for spouses of gay service members.

Her thought was-I don’t want to pay for gays so let’s just deny everyone
You're right. All this moral policing language only serves to hurt those addicted and pain patients, since they'll always find a way whether it be clean pharmaceutical or dirty street powders.  It's not helping anyone.
I am proud of you, and I hope you are proud of you also. Your life is so much more important. Keep on keeping on, well done!! 💙✌🙂
as a chronic pain patient, I wish I could get my hands on any of those myself so I could stop being bed-ridden and have any semblence of quality of life:(  Doctors all know I need them to hold off my severe pain, but wont prescribe due to DEA scrutiny:(  addicts and pain patients are getting fucked by the crackdown on prescription opioids, forced to go to much more dangerous methods to live their lives.  


Frankly dying of a drug OD doesn't seem that bad when living in bed bed-ridden for life while everyone else enjoys their lives and careers (i'm only 26m dealing with severe and rare medical conditions and get the best treatment possible besides pain management).  Its a really shitty situation to deal with, and I had no problem getting these drugs when I was undiagnosed 4-8 years ago, or when 10 years ago I had a string of 6 major surgeries.  However i'm in the midst of 5 major surgeries and have received literally one days worth of painkillers total.  Its complete BS that the only time I get to live my life is when my pill connect comes through (once every couple months).
I live in Utah and the damn roxycodone has run rampant in some areas here too. August will be 2 years off opioids for me. None of my friends that started using have stopped yet. I'm sick of funerals because of fucking opioids!
I'm at Almost 9 months from fent/heroin. I was using in Florida but moved when I stopped. It really gets easier the more time you spend away from it
63 days ain't no joke! Great work. Today's going to be the best one so far too, just wait!
I always felt like it was not only just as hard but increasingly harder to get back off that shit(heroin, etc) every time I relapsed.
You’re doing great. Keep it up. It absolutely CAN be done.
I have joint problems that have landed me with spinal nerve pain that I have been taking gabapentin for for 2 years now, and I'm really curious about your gabapentin addiction.

Mostly what does it feel like and how did you start and what kind of crazy dose were you taking because after having money issues because unemployed because pain, I am very familiar with which of my drugs I can get away with dropping right away if I couldn't afford them, and that was gabapentin, I never felt the super negative withdrawal feelings like I did from my psych meds or that one time I took the doctors word for it when in the hospital and got put on a nightly sleeping pill(never do this!)
Roxis are great huh... I quit after my overdose. Congratz man, keep it up. I also had a heart condition at the time, called WPW syndrome.
>I was able to pick up 30mgs for $20/pop

That's awful. I know Roxy's were like $50/$60 for the 60mgs at a time, but heroin is like $10 for 100mg and ~$60 for a gram (1000mg). Or so I've heard. That's just nuts and I totally see why people switched to heroin instead of prescription opiates.
> Been 63 days clean off opioids, never going back

Good for you!
Gabapentin is going to be another one that will be in the news. Docs are prescribing them like crazy especially to people on suboxone.
Congratulations. And great work. Getting away from active addiction is not easy. This I know. I was hooked on prescription opioids for 5 years which turned into shooting heroin for another 5. Currently laying in a bed at a treatment center in Minnesota for my 3rd attempt at recovery. I may not know you, but I am here for you. Again, great job, friend. It will all be worth it.
Exercise and supplements are the best things you can be doing to feel better. GABA and L-Tryptophan are great amino acids for PAWS after opiates; they give you back the seratonin and dopamine your body’s forgotten how to make, help you sleep and calm the tachycardia which drives a lot of people crazy for months, long after they’ve gotten past the constant diarrhea and sweating.

My ex-husband is a pain doc in Florida, board-certified and not at all associated with the pill mills that used to be everywhere in Broward. He mostly does interventional medicine (procedures like epidurals), and only prescribed anything stronger than 5mg percocet if the patient had cancer, was post-op, or just had an accident (like the guy who fell off a shrimp boat and landed on the pier on his back, or citrus pickers who tore their rotator cuffs or worse). When patients asked him for Xanax, he told them benzos are psychiatric meds and they needed to see a shrink for that. For patients in psych care, he required a release from the psychiatrist to make sure they knew their patient was on pain meds. He turned away patients who lived in a different town and had no good reason to be driving far to get to him. He turned away patients under 25 unless they were citrus workers (it’s back-breaking work done by migrant workers). 

So, he wasn’t just responsible - he was overly cautious, a side effect of his OCD. And he still had patients die, because they weren’t doctor shopping but they were buying extra pills on the street. And because they were mostly just buying more oxycodone, they never failed their monthly drug tests. I think one had mixed benzos, but they only show up on a basic dipstick test for 3 days so that’s not hard to test clean for.

I ran his practice through 2010, which is the year the pill mills were shut down and the DEA instituted a bunch of new rules for pain practices and pharmacies, which ended doctor shopping and put the fear of god into any doc who was loose with the scripts. It was a crazy year. We had patients call us in tears hours after leaving our office because they couldn’t find a pharmacy in a 50 mile radius who could fill their prescription, even if my husband tried changing it over the phone (that wasn’t illegal yet). We knew early in the day every time a practice had been raided because the phones would be blowing up with people in a panic who were supposed to have their appointment that day. 

The first time a local doc got raided by DEA, we let a bunch of those patients come to us the same day. It was surreal. Like our waiting room turned into a nightclub. It reeked of booze and stale cigarettes. When we saw those people’s empty bottles of what they needed refills on, just omg. No words. One woman was getting prescribed over 200mg of methadone a day, plus 400 roxy 20’s, and 200 10 mg valiums. My husband was like “how is she awake? She drove here?!” And they were all that bad. He turned most of them away without charging them for the visit, just saying “sorry, I can’t give y’all this stuff”. Some of them were crying. 

One patient he did see was a man in his 80s who was there with his grandson. He had awful pain in just one hand and lower back on one side, which is weird. He had been told it was arthritis. The grandson was obviously dopesick. He smelled like booze and couldn’t sit down, he just paced around the waiting room and was super upset when we wouldn’t let him come back to the exam room with Grandpa. When my husband read his chart from the other clinic, he saw that imaging had found bone lesions from multiple myeloma in the man’s hand and lower back, with the diagnosis confirmed by blood tests. Fatal cancer in the bone marrow. This man had cancer that was probably going to kill him in the next couple years and no one had ever told him. It was the most disturbing thing I encountered during the pill mill era, and there were a lot of very disturbing things.

What I actually responded for though was to back you up that yes, of course real oxy is still on the street. I have a friend from Ohio, his whole family basically works/worked at an OxyContin factory. Parents, aunts, uncles, cousins. They all stole massive amounts of it to sell and/or use, and that’s just one factory for one brand. Most of his relatives are in prison now or dead from ODs. His parents missed his wedding and the births of all 4 of his kids because they’re in prison for stealing and selling oxy. His stepdad just died from an OD a few months ago, his uncle 2 years ago.  Whole family devastated by those pills.

So that’s one explanation I can think of for how there are still legit brand name pills floating around: good old-fashioned employee theft.
Respect. I'm a former smack addict with a buprenorphine prescription in the UK. This shit is global. There's a black market in opioids here too - although heroin is so readily available a lot of people just do that.
Proud of you my dude! Hope you stay clean forever off that shit and do great things
Probably because there's a bus that drives from Miami to new york and back again. This is all this bus does so it is quite possible for someone to use it to ferry their drugs back and forth.
Or it was fent, not Roxy.
I know a guy in CT that got caught selling 60,000 roxys to an informant. About the same time frame. People dropping like flies from the same combos around here too. Pretty damn sad.
2001Tabs where about NY are you from? I'm from the upstate Rochester area and pills of all variety have been easier and easier to get I've noticed for some reason. I'm not a user, and dont plan on it, but  despite that somehow everything up here is easy to get your hands on now.
When I was in high school, I had dental surgery. They prescribed me a bottle of liquid roxy as tall as my head.  Didn’t need even a fraction of it.
99% sure those roxicodone pills that flooded the market were cheap because they were fakes.
I broke my ankle two summer’s ago and was in a lot of pain. But the second I was able to handle the pain, I quit taking any opiates. My doctor continued to push me to refill my prescription but I simply told him I didn’t need it. Lots and lots of marijuana really helped.
It’s better on this side, friend. Congrats on 63 days. Congrats on today.
I'd bet my life those were pressed pills.I live in the sticks and ran into a guy with 30,000 30's for $12 per a while back. Tjey were pressed.This is in a county of 80,000 in WV. I'm an addict myself and refuse to do Oxycodone ir the problem is so bad I stick to Opana..Congrats on getting clean.
They fetynal laced blues are wicked obvious that their fakes! At least to anyone who was in the perk game for a while!
In my state people started paying crazies amount of money for 30s
What are the effects of taking gabapentin recreationally?  I'm just curious as I've taken it for 15~ years in a low dose for migraine headaches.
Gabapentin?? What aspect were you hooked on?
The comedian??
For those wondering, Schedule 1 drugs are said to have no medical value at all. Bullshit, right?
Oklahoma has medical MJ now and we are fighting the "big pharma." One of the few times I can say I'm proud of my home state on the national level.
There are a lot of things not mentioned, and many things misunderstood in this breakdown, I think. I witnessed much of the opiate epidemics formation and effects in real time and I think most of it is due to Purdue Pharma's lies and hype about oxycontin, it's rise to popularity as a result of said lies, and its abrupt halt which lead legit patients and abusers to the streets to buy illegal alternatives. Things were ugly, sure, but they got really ugly after the crackdown on oxycontin scripts rolled around. In my experience, that's when people really started dying. It let directly to an explosion in heroin, which lead to the fentanyl, then carfentanil. The series of events and carelessness involved is on a level so flagrant that it's almost hard to believe the people making decisions didn't know exactly what was going to happen.
Specifically, I think one of the largest issues unique to America is that doctors and patients have a vendor-customer relationship rather than a more traditional doctor-patient relationship like they would in other countries.  Doctors need to keep a patient happy otherwise they get a bad review and/or the patient doesn't come back.  If enough patients don't come back, a private practice will go out of business.

I went to a doctor who had a look of terror on her face when I pulled out a phone shortly after a visit.  She thought I was going to log on a give her a bad review because I wasn't given strong enough drugs.  She said that has become a pretty common occurrence, and the reviews are partly how her bosses judge her performance.

That's a messed up way to run a health system.
> America likes its drugs

They have to find some way to get through their shitty day!
Basically the same thing McConnell is doing now. It was a while ago and local so limited news to find but from what I can find he was intentionally not bringing it to the floor and not whipping up the votes for it.

My son in law died of a narcotic OD as well, leaving behind a wife and 2 small children. Stories like this absolutely enrage me!
If opioids were legal and regulated, your friends and family members likely would still be alive. Sorry for your loss.
Florida has cracked down massively in the last 5-10 years.
> people who distribute opioids

What about the people who take them?
Florida has a state registry in place now for controlled substances. The pain clinics are heavily regulated as well and basically no one outside of a registered pain clinic will write you more than a 3 day supply. You have to go to a pain clinic, sign a contract with them that you won't doctor shop, and then are entered into the state database that tracks your narcotic fills. It's eliminated out-of-state prescribing as well, which was a massive issue. 

Private pharmacies also have a ratio of sales they can't surpass without being flagged by the DEA. They can only have 30% of their prescriptions be controls and the other 70% have to be legend drugs.

Actually, as detailed as this post is, I've got to agree. It seems to change halfway through to the exact surface level stuff that it claims the issue is deeper than.
Walgreens/CVS  warehouses buys the drugs for the region. Is it Walgreens fault 

Most pain clinics were sponsored so if they didn't have an on-site pharmacy they would send customers to specific pharmacy locations.

How is this a drug companies fault

And then even in a court of law jurrors didn't think it was anyone else's fault 

At the end of the day my biggest concern was 

> There was a culture of customers that knew what to do to get what they wanted
Glad to provide a good read.  More than anything I wish people would change thier opinion on who to blame.  There's blame to everyone
You mean drug companies run by people who did stuff like this:

“Sackler, the son of a company founder, said sales representatives should advise doctors to prescribe the highest dosage of the powerful drug because it was the most profitable, according to the court filing, The Times reported.”

[source](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20190116/pharma-owners-accused-of-lying-about-oxycontin) 

Yeah, they didn’t do anything wrong.
Do you really think the drug companies are not culpable? They funnel millions (billions?) into "lobbying" the government. They send out representative to doctors with free samples and financial incentives to over-prescribe. Their lawyers probably make make money than a small nation. The drug companies knew exactly what they were doing. Are the solely to blame? Definitely not. There's plenty of people in the government that should be getting punished as well.

I live in a place called Elk Valley, TN. The closest "town" is Jellico, and it's really just an exit off of 75. Thos entire area is riddled with drugs and drug money. Hell, without that money most of the people in this county would be homeless. Couple this with some of the most corrupt cops in America, and this problem ain't going anywhere soon.
Drugstore Cowboy
35$ a share in 2000 to 142$ in 2018, so, just a little.
I’m not pointing the finger towards anyone, but there are Suboxone clinics everywhere in America now. I go to one and have been going for 14 months. Now I’m addicted to them. This is supposed to be the safer alternative, and if we are being truthful, I have to say, I don’t wake up sick anymore, I don’t do illegal things to get my fix, I don’t have to worry about jail, I can function at a job and go every day, etc.

However, if something happens and I don’t have the $300 a month for doc visits, and $200 a month for prescriptions, once I do start getting sick, I don’t know what I will do. Back to the streets? Highly likely. This is a direct result of all this opioid crisis mess. These places are packed to the gills, everywhere. We haven’t even begun to see where this will lead the epidemic.
fun fact: the guy who is dumping most of the fentanyl into America has already been arrested before but even though we found literal kilos of heroin and fentanyl in his house when he was already on parole for drug charges he never spent another day in jail and is still walking around a free man laundering millions of dollars a year through a major record label.

https://amp.detroitnews.com/amp/99743294

it is literally impossible to deny the fact that the DEA and federal government are directly involved in the fentanyl and opioid crisis
And what are they doing, with the *millions of doses of fentanyl* that have been seized recently?
Interesting. I've heard of this happening.
So what I’m just supposed to *not* use it to clean my eyes like some kind of Jabroni?
It 100% means no eye tears, the phrase is inside a red teardrop and the bottle also says "as gentle to eyes as pure water"
Their 80s commercial referered to crying tears. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx12JmY4hKU
I’ve got a bottle of the shampoo right now. It says “as gentle to the eyes as pure water” right on the front.
Why is it next to the eyeball then
No it doesn't. In other countries the slogan is translated in the "no crying" sense. This is just something plausible-sounding that someone on Tumblr came up with, like the whole "blood of the covenant" thing.
Then why did the old commercials pronounce it like the saltwater that comes from your eyes?

It's a tumbler post that everyone references which was wrong/lie.
Just not true [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.refinery29.com/amp/en-us/2017/08/167926/loreal-kids-shampoo-no-tears-meaning)
Actually no.  If you have blepharitis, doctors will advise you to scrub your eyelids and lash line with baby shampoo and a washcloth. That's because it's not supposed to burn like other cleansing formulas if you get it in your eyes.
ya no
Call them on this shit. "I see you making a face like I've done something wrong. Please explain."

I've had doctors talk down to me, act like my concerns aren't valid, and basically write me off, and I wasn't even there for pain. It's bullshit, and it's inappropriate and unprofessional.
You need better doctors. Mine are quite happy that I'm taking the "minimum viable dose"  instead of just loading up on painkillers all day.
Had to have some pretty serious surgeries when I was in my late teens after a horse riding accident messed up my right leg, hips, and lower back. The pain killers I was prescribed made me puke none stop for a week yet I looked forward to taking them. Realized what was going on and just tried to manage things with advil for the next 8 weeks. I just put down on my medical records that I have a bad reaction to that opioid. Seems what happens to a lot of people is that they get hurt and needs opioids to deal with the pain and get over prescribed or react a little too well to them and end up getting addicted without realizing it.

I am a chronic pain sufferer and have been told based on *objective* evidence that there is nothing left for me with respect to back pain. I have loss of feeling in my left leg, daily pain up to 7/10, some nights I am crying and some nights I can’t sleep. It sucks even more so because I am so so young. I first got diagnosed at 20, had a fusion that year, it deteriorated more, and here I am with worse stenosis, radiculopathy, and degeneration and herniations spanning my lumbothoracic  spine. 

All surgeons I have seen have told me I am better off seeing a pain management clinic at this point. I did, and we tried everything conservative before opioids because for me that was the last resort. They all failed. The gabapentin did help for my nerve pain but nothing worked for the actual pain in my back. 

I am prescribed opioids now and I like to think I don’t abuse them. But there are times where I have no choice but to take them on a near daily basis. Why wouldn’t I? Im 27 years old. I can’t stand for more then ten minutes. I can’t sit in the same position for more than five minutes. I can’t walk long distances on vacations and I have a newly developed fear of flying due to a severe pain episode I had cramped on a plane. I have a poor quality of life without them. Why wouldn’t I choose to be in less pain? 

I feel like the general public chastises those who use opioids, even if for legitimate purposes. And it’s unfair. While the dangers of addiction are real and known, some people literally do not have a choice.
It’s absolutely barbaric and unnecessary. I have suffered for 3 months, total billshit.
Some people are addicted to pills.

Some are addicted to money.

I think it's the same process for both.  Or very, very similar.
If people vote for loose legislation (I want a small government because of freedom) this is what you get. It's awful, but not a surprise when people are more concerned with immigrants.
It's sad that a logical idea that would save lives gets called devil's advocacy. We're so attached as a society to this stigmatization of drug use that we'd rather stick with punitive harshness (which fails constantly) than try anything else.
No argument. But I worked in a treatment facility and was a RN. We KNEW who the go-to docs were in town for drug-seekers. So did all the pharmacists in town (pop. 150K). And it was definitely no secret amongst the drug community.

Yet these doctors continued to operate for years and years. Meanwhile, every other practitioner is scared to write a legitimate script for opioids for  fear of drawing the attention of the DEA. People with an actual need for opioid pain meds are denied treatment while those creating and feeding the opioid addiction problem continue to operate with impunity. 

Go after the criminals, not the victims. And stop demonizing a class of drugs which are very effective and absolutely necessary when prescribed and taken appropriately.
I had a root canal, same deal, serious opioid prescription. Only I was in high school, and I didn't have any awareness of how heavy duty they were. I took a few for pain, then didn't bother with the rest. 

My overseas friends were shocked when I told them what I had been prescribed.
Personal responsibility only works if you actually knew the dangers of the meds you are taking.  The fact that we need a prescription for opiods and other drugs is the government saying it is the Dr.'s responsibility as they have the knowledge that you don't.

&#x200B;

Having said that, if we took more responsibility for our health we all would be better off.
I was first prescribed opiates for endometriosis when I was 16 (around 2000). Told by numerous doctors *take these exactly as directed and they can't hurt you*

Ten years of addiction, then three years of using maintenance medicines made by the same fucking company that sold us the original "cure" 

Richard Sackler and Mitch McConnell must be in a competition to decide who the worst human in the world is

Congrats on your willpower and having the foresight to get prescribed it after the truth has been revealed on long term opiate use.
It's not about the responsible people who get the pills, it's about how dumb easy it would be for someone with bad intentions to do the same. Even you agreed it was a stupid amount and this person is a medical professional. They knew exactly what they were doing but didn't care because they were getting paid. What you did with those pills wasn't their concern but by the very nature of the prescriber's job it should have been.

Edit: Took out my doctor gender bias cuz Reddit would eat me alive.
As an addict in recovery, I agree with you 1000%. I may not have known the dangers initially, but I was pretty damn sure what the hell I had gotten myself into after the first month. I just loved getting high though, so fuck it, right?
[deleted]
I was told to take quite a lot of them after I gave birth. I just had some minor tearing, it wasn't like a C-section or any kind of complication. I absolutely hated the stuff and couldn't even stay awake to care for my newborn, so I went to ibuprofen two days in and it was fine. For some reason, when I relayed this to my doctor, she gave me that look they give you when you haven't been taking your heart meds or something. The whole experience was bizarre.
Re: Pain as the 5th vital sign. Another policy pushed by well-meaning individuals (and corporate bureaucrats looking to cover their asses) which precipitated an avalanche of unintended consequences.
[deleted]
Barely being 20 and having a heart condition I hope I make it far I was really damaging myself. Now I bench 80lbs (used to never work out all) take all sorts of health supplements and try to remain sober (from weed/alcohol) as possible.

Most former addicts were right when they told me it gets easier everyday, and I feel like it does.
Thank you for spreading such positivity. The world is a dark place sometimes, and sometimes all it takes is one person encouraging you to be your best. It really is appreciated ❤❤
This is why I behave like a saint regarding my pain management physician. Same pharmacy, don't change appointment times, piss correctly, and so on. Without the 4 10mg oxycodone tablets a day, I have to make constant choices of what I will miss out on.
Friend of mine is hurting (literally and figuratively) from the opioid crackdown. As a late teen/young adult, doctors wouldn’t take his pain seriously, and he turned to illicit drugs, nearly ruining his life completely. When he was finally diagnosed and given the meds it required, it was such a dramatic change for him. He got clean, got his life back, built a business and became a new (and better) person. He’s been doing great for years. Until now. Pharmacies in our state are now refusing to fill prescriptions, giving all sorts of excuses and alternatives his doctors try barely do anything at all. Without proper medication, I’m seeing my friend fall apart all over again. Bed ridden in pain. Unable to work. Business he worked so hard to build is beginning to fail. It’s horrifying and infuriating.  

Yes, there is an opioid problem. But this knee jerk reaction is hurting patients that actually need it.
I chopped my hand mostly off in 2010, Doctors we're able to reattach it. 1.5 week long stay in the hospital, first week back home we went to refill my Percoset, they said it would be my last one as they were concerned about addiction...
I do think we’ve swung too far to the other side. These drugs do have a positive medical benefit in some groups of people.
Dude that's nuts.   I had a vastecomy done last year and they prescribed me something like 30 Percocet.   I asked for something else (fear of addiction) and she just said fill and and keep them "just in case".  I never filled it.   Ibprofen worked fine.   

My point is I was prescribed a shit load for such a minor surgery and meanwhile people who could use pain killers for major pain can't.
I had my surgeon prescribe the wrong pain medication after a surgery. They gave me 5-325 hydrocodone, which they had been giving me for 11 days leading up to the operation, when I was supposed to get 10mg oxycodone. Due to regulations I wasnt able to get the right prescription filled for 10 days. When the nerve block wore off I had to go to the ER because of the pain, and couldn't sleep more than 1 hour at a time. That was seriously brutal and may have left me with traces of ptsd.
It's a fucking shame what's happening to you, all to stop idiots from getting high.
Visit another country to recoup,  if you can  Costa Rica is nice,  morphine is plentiful.
I'm not sure where you live, but if you can get to a research hospital or their associated clinics they'll likely be able to take care of you. They're able to better document and diagnose so the DEA is very happy with their decisions. If opioids are the legitimate best option for you, they'll easily be able to prescribe them. They may have other things they can try though.
Maybe not a popular opinion, but I believe CBD and marijuana in general could help with some of your pain problems as well as others experiencing similar issues. Either way I hope you get the medicine you need to help with your pain.
Tell me about. I went through extensive dental surgery and was literally dying. Two things happened. 

1) Dentist refused to prescribe an adequate pain medication.
2) A waitress who saw me suffering asked me how many pills I had in script so we could sell it on facebook.

It is endemic.
I am so sorry for you. I hurt my back in April from work and I had a taste of, "I'd rather be dead than live like this" pain. Back pain can be extreme and is no joke and it's a tragedy and a disgrace the suffering people have to endure because of the bullshit of others.

 I was terrified I had herniated a disc the pain was so excruciating and doctors initially treated me dismissively. I had to go to PT and worsen the injury before they took me seriously. I had to cause more fucking damage to my back, before I was given anything to even slightly help with the pain. I was already eating aleve like candy and they were afraid my kidneys were going to shut down at the pace I was consuming.  I was in so much pain my ability to even think coherently wasn't functioning.  

> However i'm in the midst of 5 major surgeries and have received literally one days worth of painkillers total.

I would be bitching to high heaven. That's insane. I'm so sorry. That's just plain wrong.

You can always try kratom
For whatever reason I knew the dangers inherent in pills back in 2004ish, had good friends that got messed up big time with them, I just knew to never get too involved with that shit, I’d try one here, there.
5 years here, don’t even think about it anymore. Life is good
I take gabapentin for anxiety. What’s the issue? I don’t get a high and there’s no overdose point on them.
Queens. I used to get these roxys deep in Nassau county though.
Averaged $1/mg $20/mg was just the fair deal. I got better deals for equally valid drugs. 

100% sure it was valid. Combos I took on those roxies would of killed me if fent-laced.
It averages $1/mg, $20/30mg was just a fair deal, nothing big out here.

Fent-laced oxys are immediately reported by locals out here, im noticing a lot of people here saying they are fentanyl laced. NYC isn't the midwest.
As well as "high potential for abuse," so apparently marijuana is basically just crack
It's extra funny because cocaine and **meth** are a schedule 2. It's completely non-sensical.
Well, if you completely disallow medical research, you can make sure it stays that way.
Yeah, Utah's medical marijuana effort is a joke they're going NUTS trying to control the entire supply chain so people won't use it recreationally. Special pharmacies or special distribution centers, you have to get a card from a physician.

I'm thinking, isn't this an open admission that none of the systems in place for opioids is the least bit effective?

I mean, marijuana isn't killing people. I don't have the state buying Narcan by the pallet load for marijuana. Yet no one is proposing special dispensaries for opioids. No one is thinking about issuing a card for opioids. No one is thinking about monitoring every aspect of the opiod suppliers' business. 

Sure, let's make this totally locked down system for marijuana, and the apply it to opioids.
You're right, there is a lot that isn't mentioned. I just dislike when the focus on responsibility gets shifted to the pawns and not the players. It's insane how shady and evil this entire scandal has been.  What do you think about Purdue Pharma developing Buprenorphine to combat opioid addiction? At this point I wouldn't be surprised if they anticipated the crisis and set up that little gem as a future revenue stream.
This is why anti-biotic prescribing went so out of control too. People were going in for colds and such and getting pissed when the doctor didn't write them a prescription. Being told "Your condition doesn't need RX treatment" makes patients feel like they wasted their money going to the doctor.
Thats INSANE.
Almost any doctor I know is backed up for a month with appointments and don’t give two shits about reviews. If you want to make up a bullshit story about your imaginary situation, at least make it believable. What kind of doctor immediately assume you using your phone is you leaving a review? Maybe because people don’t use their phones for anything other than reviews...Doctors don’t even walk you to the door.... everything about your story reeks of bullshit
There's a flip side to this nobody ever mentions. If you've got a rare disease like mine, these other medical systems outside America usually give you useless assistance which is generally a more politely phrased version of "we don't give a shit, the drugs that might help are too experimental, the drugs cost too much", etc. But here, I do have to shuffle a lot of paperwork and insurance BS, but at least I can get some experimental meds which keep me from experiencing liver failure.
Do people pay attention to medical reviews?  I wouldn’t trust a stranger’s assessment of a doctor the way I might about a hotel.
Just a heads up, that episode of American Greed isn't available to watch. They only have season 12 up on Hulu, and "Pain Killer Profits" is a season 10 episode.

At least in the US, I don't know much about hulu's availability elsewhere.
> If opioids were legal and regulated

They are.
Thanks. Hard to believe some of this stuff.

Then we get back to what should I have done differently?

There's nothing wrong with marketing their product. the product is less addictive than previous generations. 

I had surgery and took opioid painkillers and I didn't get addicted.

it seems like they didn't do anything wrong, but we just don't like that they make money.

Which is not an argument, but instead hurt feelings.
Thank you.
Yea baby those gains! It's mostly only poor people dying so it's ok. /s
I’m glad I saw someone post this.


The true bubble is going to pop when suboxone is taken away but no one listens to me about any of this shit.

It’s crazy sad
Take it or leave it but I suggest you taper off now while you still can. I’ve seen people who’ve been on subs for years detox and it ain’t pretty. Worse than dope or pills. There’s no reason to stay on maintenance for more than a year imo. Wish you the best either way.
It seems like suboxone draws addiction out like a weaker methadone. I know people who say kratom works better to avoid withdrawal to actually be able to taper off, but it's still difficult.
Some woman won a ton of money in a civil suit after she got crotch cancer that they showed to be linked to her ubiquitous baby powder usage in her crotch area.
Before this spreads a panic, yes it is a possibility. Talc is often found in conjunction with Asbestos in deposits, and Asbestos is a known carcinogen. That being said, separation and filtering methods are good enough that it is vastly unlikely that a particle of Asbestos remains in talcum powder. I wouldn't be surprised if you'd be far more likely to be attacked by a shark than contract cancer from baby powder.
Um... No? You're not brushing/combing your eyes correctly. Did you repeat or just lather and rinse?
Jabroni. Cool word.
That sounds like the baseline doctor's attitude, from my experience. Why legislators place so much faith in them I'll never know... oh, actually, no, I do know: the legislators are even less connected to reality.
It wasn't my doctor. It was a clinic the company used for drug testing and physicals.
I'll just whip up a better doctor then. Amazing nobody thought of that. Have a bad doctor? Skills shortage ensuring that only the worst doctors practice in your area? Legislative practices and excess workload ensure any new ones you do get are burned out in 12 months? Just... make a new doctor, a better one! Yes!
What's fucked up about this is the pain patients had absolutely 0 to do with this entire crisis, and now they are being handled differently because of it. At the end of the day the corporations and the real people responsible will get a slap on the wrist, and the people will suffer. As always
Well doctors dont prescribe money for pain.
I used to be a Pharmacy Technician (I basically just put pills in the bottles, dealt with insurance, and typing up the prescriptions ["tk 1 t po d" = "Take 1 tablet by mouth daily" if I remember correctly]). We got robbed. One of our customers said we deserved it because we took too long getting his opioids. It's people like that that make everyone taking opioids look bad.

And unfortunately that single individual ruined my empathy/remorse for people on opioids.
It's a cultural problem too. In America the "need" for opiods is perceived by the average layperson as much lower than other countries. You go to Europe and if you are in pain you might get Ibu800 or something like that and Oxy is ONLY given to terminally ill or cancer patients.
ingoinal hernia, down by the rig, y'know? They gave me 30 percocets, I didn't take any the first day, because I had lifted wrong, and the hernia was an avoidable thing, so I went without painkillers the first day, and pretended I was injured in Braveheart, by a sword. Still have 3 or 4, and the surgery was 3 years ago.
Eh, but would you say the same thing about junk food and getting fat?

It's weird to me that fat people all "should have known what would happen" while junkies just weren't educated properly and it's never their fault
Personal responsibility *IS* knowing the dangers of the meds you are taking. Never put anything in your body unless you've thoroughly researched it on your own. Why people blindly trust doctors is beyond me. Doctors are just people. They have extensive medical training, but they're still subject to the same shortcomings as anyone else. If you take a prescription without researching it just because a doctor told you to, you're a fucking moron.
That’s utter nonsense. You don’t understand the medication, you don’t understand the distinction between physiological dependence and addiction, and you don’t understand addiction and the demographics of those afflicted.

Stop spreading misinformation and educate yourself before you voice an opinion.
"If you were to take those pills as directed by your dentist, there is a pretty high possibility that you'd become dependent and on them long term or turn to heroin"

If this was the case everyone who had surgeries or dental work would become addicted. SMH!
[deleted]
Good on you, buddy. Keep on keepin’ on and set yourself short term goals that can be accomplished with effort. This makes everyone feel like good humans :)
It definitely does. It helps to surround yourself with people who also avoid drugs and alcohol. Many people who have never used them can be judgemental because they don't understand the addiction, but even ex-smokers can understand how something addictive like nicotine can guide your life decisions. Befriend those people who understand the struggle and you'll have a team of friends working together to say clean. Plus, you're at an age where your body will rebuilt itself quickly and you'll look and feel so much happier.
You got this, friend.  Just remember to develop good habits and stick to them.
When you start to find enjoyment in new activities, you look back and you realize that if you were still in your old lifestyle you couldn't enjoy the new things. It's then that you realize how much you were limiting yourself. 

And when you realize that it makes you understand how much more you can achieve.  

 When you realize how far you have come the fog clears and you can see this long stretch in front of you what is actually possible now.  Then you can see how far you truly can go now that you're not handicapping yourself.
You sound like me. I have a vsd , did a metric fuckton of drugs in high school and the beginning of college, eventually got clean. If you are in fact like me, I can tell you, you will be denied from military service due to your condition , but you will at least make it to 29. 
Good luck!
I wish I could get someone like yours, unfortunately the only good one I’ve found has too many others on opioid therapy and can’t add anymore people without dea trouble (I guess there’s a max amount of opioid patients you can have)
I agree and am pretty much in the same state, except that I didn't need the from 2012-late 2018 but now need them to have any semblence of function/life.  Its fucking insanity that we are essentially having our lives ruined, won't save a single drug addicts life, and yet are expected to just lay down and die or curl up bed-ridden and stop complaining.  

Frankly makes me jealous of people that get cancer, at least they get good pain management before dying.  Feel like i'm just gonna have to suffer until I die, if i'm lucky enough for it to end even relatively soon.
Lol that’s absurd.  I was on 60 mg of Percocet daily from March of 2011-March of 2012, undergoing severe orthopedic surgeries and a partial knee transplant.  I was able to make a full reccovery from everything thanks to my pain meds allowing me to crush PT, while still getting a 4.0 my freshmen year of college.

Addiction happens very rarely in opioid use for legit pain.  If you haven’t had addiction problems before, very unlikely you’d develop them now.  But doctors are too afraid to use common sense because the penalties don’t agree with them.  way too much anti opioid propoganda these days, yet nothing about alcohol at all which is way worse, let alone cigarettes
Jezzes, my dad had knee replacements on both knees over the last 16 months.  I think we’ve got enough pills left over to open a pharmacy. He doesn’t like taking them but for getting through PT.
They absolutely do, but that group is massively smaller than people realize. Opioids are still heavily prescribed and demanded by migraine patients. Repeated studies have shown that opioids do not help migraines in any way. I think the real issue is that Americans still treat addiction as weakness instead of something that happens to everyone when exposed to certain drugs for certain lengths of time.
We haven't swung too far yet, the problem isn't solved yet and a lot more people should be in prison (mostly the millionaires and billionaires who knowingly orchestrated it all).
Yup its massively dynamic based on which doctor you get and who wants to take a risk.  Crazy that you got that many percocet for that, and when I had major hip surgery (one level down from a hip replacement) I got 3 percocets (of 5mg each) and told to fuck off when asking for more.  This was in NYC btw at a very good surgeon
That's rediculous.  I had major ankle surgery for a dislocated and torn tendon and received the same amount of pills as you.
I had a bad case of appendicitis and those whole 2 weeks of recovery was probably the worst amount of pain I’ve ever been in my life. I couldn’t get out of bed without someone helping me. The only pain medication they gave me was 12 tramadol 50mg which did absolutely nothing. They had no problem injecting me with fentanl 6 times a day while I was in the hospital though.
At least you were smart enough to realize you didn't really need them.
I had a minor tooth infection a few years ago and was prescribed 25 vicodin. Why the fuck would I need that much vicodin for a tiny tooth ache that stopped hurting after the first day of antibiotics?
I'm fairly sure I got some kind of PTSD from kicking an admittedly absurd heroin addiction. I think back on it now and I can easily say I would rather die. Like, no question. There's no pride that I survived, no sense of accomplishment. Just regret and dread. Fuck opiates man. I have done any drug you could name and could easily put them down, but the first day I ever got high on oxy I knew that was the way I wanted to live forever. Even now, I'm not happy I quit. I'm fucking angry that I have to go back to a life where I've never felt comfortable in my own skin. I felt at peace when I took opiates and they took everything from me. And I gladly gave. I wish I never knew what they were like in the first place, and that's not possible.

Sorry I kinda veered off track there. I got a lot to work through when it comes to addiction. Sucks.
the saddest part is that many people see whats happening to me as a "win"
Unfortunately can't really travel much, especially in an airplane.  Condition doesn't allow me to which is super great.
I live in PA but go to NYC already for treatments.  I get treated by some of the top doctors in their field, and all avoid opioids like the plague.  I'd love to get into a research hospital but unfortunately idk the process, who i'd talk to, or even if they'd help me with my condition.  I know Weill Cornell Medicine is giving the only doctor trying to help me a hassle over if theyre even gonna allow him to do this experimental surgery on me to get my life back.  

Considering my condition has never been written down in medical literature before, I have a hard time believing that a research university would do it anyway, coming from what I know from them.
Have tried both, trust me I love smoking weed but weed actually makes my pain worse and CBD doesn't do anything for it.  I wish it worked:(
Oh trust me I’ve been bitching they just won’t budge.  Cites it’s literally usually illegal to prescribe opiates which is just total BS
I'm pretty sure i'm allergic to kratom:(  Everytime I take it I get terrible nausea and diahrea and rashes all over my body.  Have only taken it like 3 times but unfortunately doesn't help.
Fuck yea.

See, to me the "not thinking about it" part is what I want to do and how I want to live my life.

It's why i just don't like AA or NA very much. I was a horribly bad addict for a decade. I've been to a hundred of those meetings and I just don't want to sit there and dwell on addiction all day... Like, you go to a meeting and it's just talk about drugs, talk about "your disease." Like, i want to move on with my life. I don't care to talk about getting high and I actually find it sort of triggering.

I used to go to this detox down the street from me when i lived in Florida. I had been to that damn detox so many times that the staff there was on a first name basis with me and I with them. So, this detox required you to go to like 3-4 AA meetings a day, because there's literally nothing else to do but throw up and not sleep. 

So, I'd sit in these meetings and it'd mostly be people just talking about how fun it is to shoot up and then the conversation just devolves into people talking about getting high. I remember one time, I got massively triggered by someone talking about speedballs and had to leave the room... Then, the nurses there threatened to kick me out if i didn't go back into the meeting and it wasn't until 2 other people walked out that they realized the meeting had gone to total shit.

I'd enjoy listening to addicts like you...someone with 5 years of sobriety. But often, there would be people with like 30-90 days and they'd be speaking at meetings. Like, I'm proud of them for those days they have, but it just doesn't really seem like enough for me to listen to them lol.

My friend and his girlfriend decided to quit drinking...they were sober for like 3 weeks, then decided to go speak at a meeting about how great life is because they're sober now. They obviously relapsed like a week later. And by speak at a meeting, I mean they went to a detox and were the sole speakers at a meeting to a bunch of sick addicts. It wasn't like an open meeting where everyone gets a chance to talk. They just sat there for an hour and talked about being 3 weeks sober lol.

I also swear I saw a speaker at that detox going to the same dope man as me like two weeks prior lol

Like, I'm at 9 months now and no way in hell would i want to go speak at a meeting because i don't think it's long enough for me to be preaching to detoxing junkies how great my life is now. Maybe, once i get years of sobriety i will. But right now, I just don't think it's appropriate.

Also, there's no "cross talk" at meetings, so if someone just wants to ramble about nonsense and be an idiot, you just have to listen and can't call them out on their shit.

Sorry for the rant. But i tried the AA and NA thing so many times and it is so stupid. Idk why I'd want to dwell on my addiction all the time like that. Ive instead discovered new hobbies and try to keep the dope out of sight and out of mind.
Ahhh alright yeah I'd assume NYC would be easier than upstate but still, it's getting easier to get everything up here.
The price isn't what made me think it was pressies. It was saying their had been an increase in availability. If all the sudden the amount of pills available goes through the roof and the price drops something is up. The only way that happens is a warehouse robbery or pressed pills.I have friends doing 20 years in the feds for pharmacy  robberies. These dudes would hit a dozen spots all over the US each trip and come back with tons of pills and that didn't drop the price around my way  for most people and I live in the sticks. So if someone is putting enough product on the street in a place as big as NYC then something is fishy.The guy I knew with all the pressed pills cops in NYC btw.
Alcohol?

Ok there are some medical uses but the abuse rates are though the roof.
Well, some asshat *did* name a strain of weed "green crack"
I blame lobbyists and politicians for allowing themselves to be bought by the lobbyists. There’s no other reason pot would be Schedule 1.
Cocaine has medical uses.
It wouldn't surprise me if that is their intention. At the same time I think it's a very useful drug for recovery. Things like methadone can still be effective if used correctly, but it's difficult and time consuming and expensive to do it right without enabling addiction to a new substance. Buprenorphine is more useful as an outpatient drug since its less abusable, but it's still abusable. Things like that are highly complicated though and what works best is on an individual basis.   


As for their intentions and the reason it was developed.. almost nothing would surprise me, but I haven't seen any actual proof of that with my own eyes yet, even if some things line up for it to make sense. Regardless of why it was developed I am glad it exists. If they focused more of their money on developing things like it and more long term solutions instead of lobbying for evil shit, they could probably still make a decent amount of money doing relatively ethical stuff.. which in a way kind of makes it worse.
Going in for a cold is definitely a waste of time and money regardless lol. Just buy some off the shelf cold medicine, stay warm, and go to bed early ya idgits.
Thanks it must have been recently changed
It is just as addictive as full-fledged opioid agonists. I’m scared to death I’ll be taken off of them at some point. Although they saved my life and gave me a new chance at it, i know it’s coming on down the road.
Oh I know that now, but no one told me anything about it when I started. The best thing you can do if you’re addicted is check in to a rehab and let them give you a dose for a few days that way you won’t have w/d and you can be monitored. You’re right, there’s no reason whatsoever people need to be on suboxone for a year. Thanks queefs4ever.
Yeah I’ve heard wd can last up to a month. And that’s not including PAWS.
*a jury linked it, a scientific panel did not
Juries have been pretty split on these verdicts. There was a huge plaintiff verdict in Missouri last year, but recently there have been defense verdicts in South Carolina and California. A plaintiff verdict in New York also just got thrown out by the appellate court because the plaintiffs "scientific" evidence was not reliable enough to be admissible.
found the johnson and johnson account
Strange, when did they start claiming that? I remember there was an incident in space station, during space walk when these "no tears" shampoos were used to clean the inside of the helment and it essentially made astronaut blind. In space, during a spacewalk.
Lather?

How do you lather after you drink it?

Jump around a lot? Because I've tried it. Still tangley
Yep. As an aside, my last visit at my pain management clinic I was drug tested. I kinda freaked out but was confused and flat out told the NP that I was obviously going to test positive because of my script. She said “that’s the point.” They want to make sure you’re actually taking it and not selling. Kind of fucked.
I want to find that doctor.  


"Oh doc, my back is just killing me so hard, an I tried everything, but I don't want none of them opioids, ya hears?"  


"Fine, we will send a prescription of a thousand dollars to your pharmacy, I want you to take $20 in the morning and $20 at night, then come see me when you run out"
I am aware of this.
I think the difference is no one is prescribing you junkfood, generally if a doctor prescribes you anything you trust your doctor and finish the course exactly as directed; in the case of most medicine this is extremely important and its rather unintuative to suddenly not trust your doctor in regards to one specific class of medicine.
> If you take a prescription without researching it just because a doctor told you to, you're a fucking moron.

Fucking thank you. So many people willing to throw blame at anyone but themselves.
[deleted]
I'm an alcoholic and I'm *very* lucky to have friends (from prior to the shit hitting the proverbial) that empathise. I also was "lucky" to "become" an alcoholic in my late teens/early 20s.

By the time I sobered up, my mates were all adulting, so it's not like I was ever left out of social events.

I wonder if it's a generational thing; millennials tend to be a bit more aware of mental health issues.
My guy is very conservative. His clinic is an upscale sort of clinic. I never wait long. He believes in treating the pain at it's source, not covering it up. He prefers to do injections and so on. I think he has learned that he has to prescribe to keep his business afloat and that procedures alone won't work or keep customers coming back. If I ask for an increase, he looks down at the floor as if I am asking for his kidney, so he doesn't budge easily. Nice guy, though.

I almost got fucked over at his clinic because a urin drug screen came back that lit up the board (benzos, morphine, Dilaudid, oxycodone, and more). He retested me right on the spot and when the new results came back, it had what I was taking, plus Flexeril - I hate Flexeril and don't take it. I mention this situation because it's that easy to lose someone who is willing to assist you over something you didn't do.

I know another doctor who reminds me of the pill mill days, but he keeps his shit straight. The clientele remind me of the old days. They smoke like chimneys, talk about their treatments in the waiting room, compare with other patients in the open, come in husband/wife pairs, ask for straight oxycodone instead of Percocet in the waiting room through the receptionist window - it's just crazy.
I'm from Europe and get prescribed oxycodone. It's much harder to get your hand on these things around here generally and I only get them due to chronic pain and some rather rare conditions. I'm taking 40mg per day right now but plan on getting rid of it soon again. Oxy works well for a couple of months and then you build up tolerance and have to get a higher dosis. 40mg per day is pretty much my limit so I'm going to get clean again soon. Although not really as potent I found that I could replace some of oxys benefits with doses of Kratom. You might want to check it out. Again it's not nearly as strong as oxy but it does a similar job and has pain-relieving qualities. Always sucks to read stories about US Healthcare since I'm from a country where Healthcare is essentially free. I've had several surgeries and stayed at hospitals for more than 60 days per year some time ago and I just can't imagine living in your country with the se conditions. I'd ruin my whole family with these bills.
Also, you can't tell your doctor you're bed-ridden or vomiting from pain without them thinking you're exaggerating to get drugs. I'm surprised I've not killed myself in the last year without pain meds. I had to quit my job, lost my car, now I rely on disability payments and food stamps which aren't enough to get me through the month. I can't even ride the bus because of the pain, so I have to get rides from my roommate if I ever want to leave the apartment. It sucks. A lot.
Yeah it was a rough couple weeks on something a bit weaker that i cant recall the name of.
“Addiction happens very rarely in opioid use for legit pain.”

I’d have to see some numbers on that. It doesn’t matter what you use them for, or are in pain or not. You can become addicted within one prescription. It doesn’t discriminate against people who need them or not. You take pain pills every day for a month, I guarantee you you will become sick without them and your brain will try to give you reasons to get them, however you can.
> Addiction happens very rarely in opioid use for legit pain.  If you haven’t had addiction problems before, very unlikely you’d develop them now.

Almost all of the people I know who fight opioid addiction started from legitimate use. This statement is patently false. 

That said, we have swung too far the other direction. There are people out there suffering with chronic pain going untreated. Addicts being suddenly cut off are switching to street drugs, significantly increasing their chances of overdose due to inconsistent potency and unknown adulterants. 

Simply turning off the supply isn’t a solution.
I don't care what some study says. Opioids do work on migraines. I had migraines for forty years. After a 5 day long headache, I'd get an injection of Nubain. Worked wonders. I still lost the day, but I wasn't in pain anymore. I've been on Triptans since Imitrex was manufactured & have been taking Zomig 5 mg for the past 20 years. 

Found out about a year ago, my migraines were caused by a magnesium deficiency. Really. Forty years of migraines due to a mineral deficiency. I thought they were due to hormones & changes in barometric pressure. I've only had 3 migraines since then. Yay!
As I said, even though they're frequently abused, opioids do have a medical benefit, especially for patients with chronic pain or those at end of life status. These patients cannot get these medications now, even though they're the ones at the lowest risk for abuse.
Yeah, we really have swung too far in the other direction. My stepmother fell down the stairs a little while back. She fractured her wrist and a glass she was holding smashed and the pieces buried in her arm. She went to the ER and the doctor gave her prescription strength Ibuprofen and wrapped up her wrist after making sure the glass 2as out and that was it. She was in quite a bit of pain. People like the above commenter are having to go without painkillers that work wonders for them because doctors are scared to death of being accused of over prescribing. Pearl clutching holier than thou Americans have not been able to get it through their thick fucking skulls that someone who wants to abuse drugs is going to abuse them. We should be making resources available to help those who want to quit, not pushing them towards dirty heroin and forcing people to live with pain. 

This whole thing is fucking stupid and it seems to me like everyone's answer is just "put more people in overcrowded jails". The war on drugs is lost and it was a complete and utter failure. It is time to try something new.
The problem WILL NOT be solved by putting the addicts in prison or patients in more pain. This is something that should be starting from the top down and anything else is the equivalent of our attempts at gun control. 

Acknowledge the problem, educate your people on the dangers of the problem and why it exists, then take aim at the source and treat those that need rehabilitation. 

Bailing water out of a sinking ship doesn't fix the leak. 

If you destroy the lobbyists, the pharmaceutical sales reps and the essentially drug dealing doctors (without adding discriminatory practices as we currently do) were going to have a large change in market dynamics. Unfortunately this will all take voting on bills of which the Pharma companies have A LOT of influence on.
I had an abscess one time, it was so bad I had to go to the ER in the middle of the night, otherwise I was just going to literally drink a whole bottle of whiskey and break out the pliers and perform my own oral surgery, and the ER doc gave me the mildest antibiotic ever, but then prescribed me dilaudid. 

Neither of those worked for me, 24 hours later, I went to the better ER a couple towns away, because my cheek and jaw had started to swell from the abscessed tooth getting worse. This time I got levaquin for the antibiotic and 10mg percocet. 


Why did I end up going to an ER twice? Because I had no insurance, dentist visits are expensive just like a regular doc would be, and none of the dentists in my area that offer emergency services wanted to take a new patient, let alone one that wasn't insured. 

So ya try to tough shit out when it happens, and that time, I couldn't tough it out, man. It hurt too much, and the infection would probably have killed me if I didn't go to the ER. 

Mouth and tooth pain is some of the worst pain a lot of people ever deal with. It was worse than childbirth for me. I can't compare it to kidney stones, though I hear that is also right up there on the oh shit just kill me now pain scale. 

So in the end, some folks do need the strong shit like that. Maybe you didn't need it, but I'm sure that doc probably knows how bad tooth pain can really be, and was just making sure you didn't end up like me wanting to just chop the whole fucking head off to make it stop.
Because some people do?  Your medical care and health condition are up to you just as much as a prescribing doctor.  You didn't need that much relief so you didn't take it, but you can't say all people react to pain in the same way and would never need that much.
Cuz it might not have stopped hurting? How would the doctors know? They ate just setting you up in case the pain is too great. Plus, vicodin is weak :p
All this anti-drug shit. Police and innocent people get killed all the time, lives lost because the government wants to stop people from getting high.
They’re so ignorant... it’s both shocking and disappointing. Nothing that’s been happening is right.
That sucks, there are alternative ways,  but yeah,  sorry mate.
What part of the country are you in??
Me either but I hated flying any way.
Baltimore,  Johns Hopkins. I have a rare disorder and was referred by my Drs. to the pain treatment center there. I tried many things they prescribed, saw every specialist but I was yet diagnosed so if you're documented, then at least that 3 yrs it took for me is not a problem for you.  They tried medications that possibly will work with serotonin and such and when decided those things wouldn't work, they saved my life with pain medication. Finally I was able to go somewhere closer to home and have always complied with every rule our wonderful govt (feds and states) comes up with to return me to suicidal thoughts. I've never increased my dosage since 1997 and do every other method of pain mgmt to make sure I don't. 

Leaving from hospital with double mastectomy and nothing for breakthrough and heavy drainage bags sewn into my chest, sucked but my clinic came through the same day; royally pissed at the hospital for not understanding/caring what I may go through on time released pain medication. Id call them something other than twats to make my point, but I hate that word!
Look into giving Kratom a shot if weed/cbd didn't work for you. It's another plant like that, but it's currently not regulated by the DEA yet, although they're trying their hardest to criminalize it currently. 

Some key things to know though about Kratom, it tastes/smokes terrible, and if you "OD" on it you'll puke it all out rather than die or something worse.
Ah, shame. Sorry to hear that.

Good luck with your journey, man!
Not a rant and I agree with you 110%. Into each there own of course, there are many different roads but I did exactly as you said, went to the meetings and NA, it wasn’t for me. When I decided to get clean for real I went to stay with my grandparents (still am and it’s helped me get my life back, got a car and a fuckin tailored suit now, fuck yeah!) but I first tried to go to detox for a week. Couldn’t take it more than two days, I don’t like the whole “only god can save you, but you’re always an addict!”

Nah fuck that, I’m an addict if I wanna be and I don’t wanna be, so I’m not. Fuck the 12 steps, I take my two steps. Left foot right foot, and repeat. That’s how I move forward. It was always something I wanted to put behind me and none of those meetings sounded like they thought that was possible. They’re just wrong, I don’t even think about anymore and I may have the occasional dream where I have a vial of cheese in my pocket, but I don’t have any cravings or anything because it is behind me, forever. I’m never getting sick again and I’m taking the lessons I learned, the reality check I experienced, and lastly I’m taking the sorrow of all my dead friends and all of our shattered lives, I’m taking all that and turning it into something good, my life. How I want it. You can do it too, if the meetings work then let em work, if they don’t, find your own path. Keep up the good fight tho man, just remember it is possible to do what you want, to have that nasty shit in the rear view, for good

Edit: I do want to add that the two days in detox really did help me to take a step back and see how things rly were. Sleeping on that brick of a mattress next to some withdrawing random dudes rly gave me a kick in the side. The greatest thing was that my grandma and great grandma got to hear that I was doing good, got a salary job (worked up to store manager from cashier), got a car. They both passed in 2017 and I’m glad they knew I was clean before they passed. I’m so so glad for that
The people I acquired them from would eat them like candy as did I, and they were definitely not involved in taking them from the pharmacies they came from.

ODs in NYC from fentanyl are about as common as regular oxycodone nowadays, the thing about this is you have to be here to understand. The price drop is from the demand and the cost of living. Opioid addicts in expensive-ass NYC aren't going to continuous buy good product for $30/pop unless they are rich, and my plugs didnt sell to wall street brokers, they sold to broke people. $20/pop was a fair and profitable flip. 

Trust me the way I saw these drugs being snorted, eaten, and smoked (heroin), I knew the difference between what was laced and what was real. 

Last time I had xanax bars they were green and had dots all over them, tasted as bitter as alprazolam yet my friends were very sketched and I Was the only one with the balls to eat them, if there was fentanyl in it, I didn't feel an opioid high even a little. Just saying how it works here.
TBF, it's a *really* good strain.
>There’s no other reason pot would be Schedule 1.

Or any of the hallucinogens
It's just hold-over ignorance from propaganda and greed at this point. There's no other explanation that meth is a schedule 2 while marijuana is a schedule 1.
Pot was classified schedule 1 in 1970 as Nixon’s way of saying "fuck you” to the anti war protesters.
So does marijuana and that's why it's non-sensical. Half the reason we're behind on research is because of the scheduling. It's completely arbitrary bullshit and politics on the DEA's part that marijuana is still a class 1. Especially when considering just how much more dangerous meth and cocaine are.
I’m scared too as I’m also working my way off them
Even if that's true you didn't refute anything they said so are you admitting they're right? Because if they are right then I guess it doesn't matter who they are.
That's just pathetic. I'd be furious in your shoes
Fuck me, I’d overdose on that by the time I got home.
damn that second clinic is crazy, especially in this climate.  Its just so fucked up what the medical system has become towards the chronically ill, feels like they want a mass extermination of us tbh.  And they are certainly starting to get it, I can easily see myself committing suicide soon over this whole fucking bullshit.
Oh yeah my healthcare costs out of pocket are over 200k to still be crippled (and not get pain care) it’s insanity.   Not to mention I can’t have my cpa career anymore, it’s all fucked.  I’m allergic to kratom unfortunately, or at least what I’ve tried
[deleted]
Have you tried kratom? I was addicted to it for 2 years but ive seen it's helped alot of pain patient. It's alot easier to quit then real opiates too
Working as a medic we had two types of OD pts we made constantly.  One were the young burnout idiot kids/hoodrats, the other were mostly older white tradesman with bad backs, several surgeries.  It was almost like clockwork.  Guy was a older plumber, doc gave him script for his back so he could keep working, doc pulled the rx out of know where.  Shit was sad
That is called dependence, and is completely different from addiction, so I don't know what you are trying to do besides misinform by spreading that addiction = dependence, which people should know is just total bullshit.

https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5790

here is your study by the way, from harvard (pretty shitty university/medical school, right?)

They looked at 568,000 surgery patients who got prescribed opiates, and only found that 1857 patients actually showed signs of misuing their opiates within a year of the surgery.  I'd say thats pretty fucking low to me right?

Also patients that had opiates for surgery years ago and never got addicted (like me), are suddenly not being given opiates for fear of addiction?  Wouldn't that have happened the first time?
https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5790 

according to harvard study of over 500k patients, opioid addiction happens in less than 0.2% of them.  I think 0.2% is very rare, and i'd imagine mostly everyone would agree with that.  In fact over 75% of opioid addicts got addicted from prescription pills that they never were prescribed.  Thats the more likely case, because addicts will take anything to get their next fix.  

Now we're in the midst of the stimulant crisis, yet no chronically ill patients are abusing stimulants.  BUt are still labeled as addicts?
I had the same symptoms from a magnesium deficiency. When it was suggested by a pharmacist that I try some strong magnesium supplements, I thought she was full of shyte. My headaches were gone by the next day and I had no further need for the painkillers I'd been munging like tic tacs for a week.
Yup just like antibiotics people use them because they work.
It was like that in the late nineties for me, up until 1998. Then the tide switched in my favor. I got well, myself, but the opioid tide pushed on too far. Now it’s going the other way. Restriction. One day, it will turn again.
I totally agree that throwing users in jail for simple possession (and cursing them with a lifelong felony charge) is a terrible solution to addiction. With that being said, it seems like you are ruling out all possible solutions - tighter control on supply of legally prescribed opiates is bad, going after the addicts with jail terms is bad...

I've seen enough drug treatment programs to know full well that 80% of people in mandatory (court ordered) treatment look at it as a fucking joke. Have overheard half of those waiting for their session to start discussing plans to buy/sell/trade drugs in the waiting area on multiple occasions. My point is, this is a very difficult problem to "solve." As usual, it is the most desperate and vulnerable people who get fucked over as we try to sort this out, but I don't see that as being any different from any other negative aspect of society.
I worked in big Pharma advertising. Thats the catalyst. The goal: teach every doctor, NP, etc. how to prescribe drug A, B, C for any applicable condition. Thats where it all starts….with the ad account director and the marketing rep from the big Pharma company. Includes the FDA, doctors, lawyers, art directors, copywriters, lots of money, etc. Trust.
Changes in market dynamics are exactly what is needed.
Yeah. I was pretty clear to the doctor that it was a minor amount of pain, and they said it was just policy. It just seemed like a lot. I mean, I was prescribed the same amount when I got all four impacted wisdom teeth pulled at once.
Pa but I go to nyc for treatment
>Some key things to know though about Kratom, it tastes/smokes terrible,

People SMOKE it? Also the taste isn't terrible. I brew a mug of tea and mix it in to sip on when I get home from work, it tastes like most other odd herbal teas. It's sorta like beer. Beer tastes like shit, but people like the affects of it enough that the shit taste grows on them and becomes enjoyable.
You puke it all out when you OD on a lot of drugs, coincidentally. Same thing with drunks. You can still die or have permanent brain damage choking on your own vomit.
Yeah, the whole "you got to work the steps or you won't stay clean!"

Like why? I can do step 1 easy. I'm an addict and my life is unmanageable.

Step 2, is about believing in a higher power... That's a massive philosophical and metaphysical question that I've spent my whole life pondering, and no...I don't think there is a higher power.

So, people at meetings are like dumb founded... Like, I literally get stuck on step 2 because I won't concede there is a God and yeah...

But it's also funny how all the other steps are pretty stupid. Like making an inventory of your past bad deeds or apologizing to people you've hurt. Like, why dwell on the shit? And a lot of people use that step about apologizing to people you've wronged as an excuse to weasel their way back into an ex's life or something. 

Idk, it's so weird how adament people are about "working the steps," but like it makes no sense how some of that shit will keep a needle out of my arm.

Also, I've had so many people tell me AA isnt about God, lol. Not god, but your "higher power that you must acknowledge in order to get sober." And then close each meeting with the Lord's prayer lol.

Step 1, i agree with. That's an important step. Everything else is such bullshit. And I don't want to dwell on it anymore than i have to. I spent years thinking about dope, I'm over it.
So a drug dealer said the rent is too damn high so I'm dropping the price??
True. The only reason it’s schedule 1 is because Big Pharma has an agenda to push.
I’m just arguing for cocaines scheduling. The schedule itself is nonsense as is the classification of marijuana. But at least cocaine’s placement matches the rules laid out by the scheduling system.
I wish you the best of luck. When you get down to a very small amount, I’ve heard the strips are the way to go because you can cut them smaller and smaller. It’s gonna be rough but we can both do it. I’ve seen other people make it.
Yep. I wasn’t mad at the time because I had nothing to”hide” but in retrospect it’s just so ... invasive and unnecessary. I’m already self conscious as it is having to call every few months for a refill. To get drug tested kind of just exacerbated that.
Nothing against you personally. As someone going into the medical field (in clinicals now) I think some people are jaded. You have to remember, for each person that has a legit reason for pain meds we get 10 with this story:

What's your pain level? 

- a f-ing 15 dude get me something! 

Well, the doctor has Tylenol down in your chart.

I can't have Tylenol, I'm allergic! I had something that worked last time I was here, I can't remember the name, started with an F though, that's what I need!


It just gets really tiresome dealing with those people, cause I can't control what the doctor proscribes... Don't spit at me if I can't get you "the good meds"
Hope you keep on fighting dude. Humans should have a right to health and it sucks that people that already are in bad situations or are right out crippled by their conditions and pain have it worse in that regard. Wish you all the best and a hopefully pain-free life someday.
Unfortunately, I can't afford it. I did try it a few times without any effect, but that may have just been the specific product I was using (I had bought a kg of powder and made it into capsules). I've only got two days left on my medical cannabis recommendation and can't afford to have *that* renewed either, so I'm kinda running out of options. It's certainly not cheaper to find opiates on the street, that's for sure.
My sister is addicted to painkillers.  She literally did not know that tramidol was a synthetic opiate.  I asked her how long she had been taking them.  She told me less than 12 months.  When I had her double check it turned out to be 5 years.  She had quickly ramped up to her maximum dose.  

She told me it was for her chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  Her chronic pain would come back every day at 4pm.  She took her pain medicine at 5pm.  Talked with her and her pain management clinic and had them start to remove the medicines.  She was on maximum dose and just wanted the pain to go away.  She was morbidly obese and complaining about joint pain in knees and back.  No shit.

After three years she is nearly off the the pain killers and down 80 lbs and doing really well.  She doesn't complain of joint pain or knee pain anymore.

When I hear that people don't think they are addicted I like to remind myself that my sister didn't even know they were synthetic opiates.  How could she be addicted?  Crying her eyes out at 4pm every day due to unbearable pain.  

A doctor diagnosed her with fibromyalgia which she didn't have.  Her doctor that gave her pills instead of saying, "your obese and you will have joint pain unless you do something about it".

I have a brother that was prescribed painkillers after falling from a ladder.  He started ordering the pills from Canada and when they stopped he bought them from China.  They send them in the mail.  When he is in a bad way he can drive to the city to get them as well.  He has been using for 17 years.  Destroyed his life, alienated him from his children, ruined his business.

You can add these two to the list of those who started from legitimate use and it spiraled out of control.  Both of them swear that they only use them sparingly and only for the most serious of pain.  They have only started using them and they are not addicted.  Their lives ruined and crumbling around them they still cannot fathom that this drug is the problem not the solution.

My wife just had surgery.  Doctor said use tylenol and if that doesn't work then take these oxy's.  Wife is eating oxy's without even taking tylenol.  The drug just made her thinking very fuzzy and only stern warning from me caused her to rethink position.  She was watching the clock waiting to take the next dose.  She wasn't even in pain when taking the oxy.  Had to remind her to take them when her pain levels rose beyond a 4 or 5.

Opiates are no good for long term pain management.  They can f'up your life so quickly.  The problem is that it disproportionately messes up peoples lives that already marginal.
Antibiotics are overprescribed in this country too. Get a viral infection, go to urgent care, ask for a Z-pack and they’ll send it to your pharmacy.
Yikes.  Medical care "by policy" is horrible.  Every patient is different and one size definitely does not fit all.
I'm near the center of Virginia. If you ever can make it down this way and have legit MRI's I can put you on to a compassionate pain clinic.I have referred three people there and they all got help. PM me if you get this way. He is legit too so no fear of your doc getting shut down.
Why would anyone suggest smoking Kratom. I have never heard of anyone doing that?

What kind of idiot would do that
You can find people who do basically anything with any drug, I wouldn't be so shocked, but yes that's why I mentioned it's terrible.
Haha that shit always cracked me up. 

“It’s not about god at all my friend, here now read this prayer about our lord Jesus Christ”
Simple fact you make less customers thus less money that way. 

Hey look this was my friend group, for all I know this guy was selling it at that price because its what HE got it for. 

When you're addicted to opis and someone is offering you $30 pills for $20/pop and you drug test them and they dont come up as fentanyl, you got a fair deal. Not even good. $200 for 10 pills wasnt the best bargain
The strips aren't so bad. They're definitely easier to deal with when tapering. I wasn't on it for long, but the withdrawal wasn't as awful as I had expected it to be. It also didn't do anything for my pain (and probably made it worse) so having severe pain come back suddenly wasn't an issue (since its just there anyway).
I understand that, but it seems like the general direction medicine is going: no opioids for anyone unless you are a drug addict, then enjoy this medication assisted treatment of opioids!

Don’t get me wrong, I think addicts should have access to bupe and methadone, but I think fucking over pain patients is terrible.  Also if it’s hard to discern, how about just looking over my medical records and/or talking to doctors that treat me currently would be great.  My doctors all believe I’m in a ton of pain but are afraid of the DEA to prescribe anything
This is why if I ever get seriously ill I’m putting an exit bad together. The over correction to this crisis is going to put people through unspeakable agony. And I say this as someone who grew up around junk.
I get 250grams of kratom for like $37 including shipping online and it lasts 3 weeks or more. 

I dont take capsules because for some reason it doesn't work as well as taking a scoop of power and mixing it with liquid and drinking it. If it didnt work for you it was either shit kratom or you didnt take it in a way that had it's best bioavailability. 

People are literally taking it and getting of heroin and harder shit. Including me. It really works. If it didn't have any effect you should do some more research and try again... when you have the funds. 

If you want the website I use just message me. Y u do dis to me, drugs?
Learn how drugs work on the brain. You sound very naive and simply misinformed. Do you suffer from chronic illness? Do your bones burn throughout your body when you get the random flare up? Its too bad one can’t empathize with anothers pain.
thank you very much, I wish I lived down there still as i would totally take you up on that offer.  Unfortunately moved from Richmond to DC and now back to PA over the past couple of years.  Doubt i'll be back there but if I ever do i'll reach out (assuming this BS is still happening, hopefully it isn't)
I was joking with that last reply tbh..Getting a deal from a buddy and the state been flooded is a whole different story.
Yeah my back pain from surgery is still there so I can deal with that it’s just like dealing with and fixing how something can feel like it is an ok switch I’ve been using it for a long ass time so there will be lasting effects but I get no benefit out of it other than making this awful hangover headache go away each morning and that’s it and also the shitting issue which sucks 


It sucks when you are on it but have no issue staying inside the lines drug wise. I just got caught up in this storm.
Good old opioid-induced constipation ... it's funny how often people post about pooping in r/opiates because of it though.
Big enough fine so that the masses think justice was served, small enough so that J&J can shrug it off and carry on with business as usual.
Probably a drop in the bucket for them. There's little justice that actually comes from these cases where the companies are charged what seems like a massive fine. Because for them, it's not massive. It's a small price to pay for the profit they made. And because of that, it's not much incentive to stop.
This is such b*******. This is just like the Exxon payoffs. Over the years the judgment is cut more and more by Appeals and the company responsible will never be held responsible financially.
The rich people are society’s greatest enemy.
5 mill under the table to the judge. Done and done.
Why don't Conservatives complain about activist judges when things like this happen?
Hell, i bumped into a guy's bumper in a parking lot, the restitution fee is more than i make in 3 months. 

I guess what i did was way worse than being responsible for thousands of deaths
Misleading headline. It makes it look like the judge may have been cutting J&J some slack when all he was doing was owning up to the fact that he'd previously misread his calculator.

>Balkman reduced the amount he had awarded in August by $107 million after agreeing with New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J that he had made a math error.
The court rarely wants to put a company out of buisness. The point of punishment is to help (by means of stick) company fix its problems and to operate within socially acceptable parameters.

Edit. Not sure why being downvoted, was not advocating for or against this position. Just stating how the courts usually view it.
Half a billion is not a drop in the bucket
This is why we need to teach our children that the rich people are their fucking enemy.
There was a math mistake in the first ruling. The judge was setting aside $107,600 for something but put it in as $107,600,000.
Care to support this? You're effectively accusing a judge of a federal crime.
They made $4.4 billion in profit this last quarter alone. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what they've made during the opiod epidemic they directly contributed to creating. After their adjustments for the payouts from lawsuits, they are still calling for a $1.6 billion profit for the quarter.
I'd rather the CEO and other board members be made liable for these
And if you're company sells a highly addictive and widely abused drug that you know is killing allot of people you should go out of business
Okay cock sucker
Johnson & Johnson is one of the largest companies in the world. It is a drop in the bucket for them it is less than 40% of a quarterly profit for them.
They're still posting $1.6 billion in profits for the quarter after adjusting for lawsuit payouts. It's a drop in the bucket considering all the money they have made for directly contributing to the opioid epidemic. They still made a profit this quarter after expected payouts, it's a slap on the wrist.
Judge admits he made math mistake in opioid judgement – KFOR.com

Laying on back putting toddler to bed, to lazy to properly format link...
If you look at what the proposed national payout is, roughly $48 billion J&J would only be contributing $4 billion. They certainly were involved, but this wasn’t their potato. Purdue pharmaceuticals was the biggest culprit in not only production but pushing of opiates.
40% of a quarterly profit is huge
I don't believe their products contributed to the opiod epidemic in a major way. 



Nucynta is not a drug that was abused by people, and they sold the patent in 2015. It was released in 2008 and I think I dispensed it a grand total of 2 to 3 times while I was in pharmacy in that period.




They do make duragesic patches, which are fentanyl based and could potentially be abused if tampered with, but they should not have been prescribed to people outside of serious chronic pain. You apply the patch and it lasts several days and delivered a very low dose of fentanyl through the skin. It can be am amazing treatment when used properly. We did dispense a lot of duragesic patches in the day(I'm sure it's still popular). Never once did I see someone that looked like they were getting a fix come in for them. They were quite expensive.



Edit: nucynta never went generic and was very expensive. Chemical name is tapentadol. You've probably never heard of it. Of the 2 or 3 times I've seen it, I think the insurance didnt cover one of the instances and the patient noped outta that. Their trial card was only for like 10 days of it too.
... Where in here does it say the judge was paid
They are the supplier of opium for Purdue, and actively worked to downplay the addictiveness of opiod painkillers.
Good for you.  A team of legal experts successfully argued in court that they did.  You are absolutely in the wrong here.
Yes they downplayed the addictiveness. No, the articles and others didnt mention supplying raw materials to purdue. Even if that was true, purdue would be responsible for their marketing of their products (which were a large number of abused drugs)

J&J had only 2 drugs they marketed, duragesic (fentanyl) patches and nucnyta (which is sold 7 years after conception. It was a major flop).

I'm not saying they don't deserve a fine for false marketing. Their marketing could have been used to fuel other companies. I'm sure saying their drugs are not the ones being found next to dead people 99.99% of OD cases. There were definitely a couple every year, but almost all would have been from improperly disposing of the used patch.
I don't disagree they didn't market it in good faith, I'm saying their products are not the ones that contributed to the opiod crisis. 

Yes, they mislead people with marketing. No, their drugs weren't killing any significant number of people. Most deaths related to duragesic patches would have been the result of improperly discarded patches. Animals or kids getting into them are very dangerous (thus the warnings over the box)
"It's not addiction. It's surprise dependency." - Big Pharma
"The Oklahoma ruling will bolster hundreds of other lawsuits in the pipeline against leading opioid makers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains by counties, cities and states across the US **blighted by an epidemic estimated to have claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades.**"

...

Getting hooked on illegal drugs and dying as a result is one thing but for the pharmacuetical industry to knowingly perpetuate addiction by prescription resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths is the absolute worse face of capitalism and profit at any cost.
In 1982, Johnson & Johnson faced a [crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/IHT-tylenol-made-a-hero-of-johnson-johnson-the-recall-that-started.html) when customers died due to Tylenol. They spent $100 million on a recall, when companies didn't do recalls. Back then, the company took pride in making good products, and they were willing to take losses to prove that point. 

What happened? It's not due to capitalism or concerns over the stock price, as J&J has been a public company for decades.
Hiding behind citizens united could well be the worst possible strategy in American legal history.  He just handed OJ the fucking glove.
Imagine getting locked up for a few grams of weed and these assholes are out here peddling death. Fuck 'em.
>he company’s lawyer, Stephen Brody, argued that if the state were to prevail then public nuisance laws could be used to make McDonald’s pay for the obesity crisis, gun manufacturers for shootings, and the oil industry for climate change.  

If only....
>Brody responded by saying he was caught off guard by the intensity of Beckworth’s presentation. He said: “I’m somewhat surprised by the invective.”

Did you think he had no evidence whatsoever?  Or are you confused that the email you got from your boss that the judge had been paid off was wrong?
It’s insane that the conglomerates have the audacity to ask cases be thrown out. Its like  tyrone has two speeding tickets and was like hey judge can we toss the case out cause nobody died?
The company’s lawyer, Stephen Brody, argued that if the state were to prevail, then public nuisance laws could be used to make **McDonald’s pay for the obesity crisis, gun manufacturers for shootings, and the oil industry for climate change**.

Sounds like a good plan
Johnson and Johnson can both suck Johnson and Johnsons Johnsons respectively.
Good for them that they at least argue it out publicly in court. The other companies (Perdue & Teva) settled instead of having any of this brought to light.
They talk about it like you can just walk into any old place and get oxy. Shit I've had chronic back and hip pain for 10 years and I can't get it. 


I wish it were that easy.

When is the class action lawsuit for mass suicides of pain patients caused by being cut off by pain management?

I have polycystic kidney disease and am heavily suicidal because I've been refused help by every single doctor I've seen in the last 5 years. I don't go out. I don't want want to exist anymore. I stopped going to doctors and only hope for an end. I want something to change before I join this millions strong group of suicides and suicidals created by normalization of medical neglect against pain patients, but killing us has been made publicly acceptable by pretending needing pain management is the same thing as being an addict. If you haven't heard about this it's because the media ignores deaths like this.
Check out this load of shit:

[Johnson and Johnson’s Credo](https://www.jnj.com/credo/)
1.Oklahoma’s attorney general will win there multi-billion dollar lawsuit. 

2.Johnson & Johnson's will appeal the ruling.

3.appeals court lowers the settlement to just 0.0001% of the original ruling.

4.Johnson & Johnson's will pay there now $10,000 fine.

5.yet another company gets a way with fucking over the population.
I genuinely feel horrible for people who got addicted due to opioids prescribed for pain, but anyone who got addicted because they liked to party can go fuck themselves. 

Source: someone who’s lost over $45K to addicted family members

Opioids are truly Pandora's box. They have a niche in medicine and help people in pain live without torment. And they also happen to be abusable (we have known that for a long time). 
What's stopping lawyers from bringing charges against Bayer for manufacturing diamorphine back in 1895?

Personally I think the companies should have some kind of administrative process to keep marketing aimed at the niche market.

They can't be all bad, Johnson & Johnson came up with the duct tape we all know and love today.
"I get it judge, but what if you like, you know, just throw it out?"
Purdue pharma is walking away, whistlin'. 

Oh, J & J, you've done fucked up.
If you give people access to something that will end their pain and possibly give them pleasure.

While not knowing the root of pain or pleasure.

Will eventually end up back in pain...
Is there any legal precedent for something like this? Big Tobacco was sued sure, but this would be similar to suing the Farmers that sell the tobacco to the large tobacco companies which hasn't been the case. J&J is being sued for selling a precursor (thebaine) to other companies that actually sell opioids. Essentially they used to sell opium poppy's which were higher in thebaine and lower in morphine and codeine. JNJ doesn't market much in the space itself.
>~~Johnson and Johnson, a family company.~~ WRONG

~~Yeah, sure.~~

Glad they are going to face the consequences of their actions, just like McKesson and the rest of them.
Yeah but we were just trying to increase profits. That's not wrong is it, surely? - Johnson & Johnson
The "caring" company has helped kill 400,000 people and ruin the lives of countless more, no shock their fucking baby powder is full of asbestos.

these companies should be charged as terrorists
Good, fuck those lying pieces of shit.  I'd say vultures, but vultures are doing good work.
should we post this on r/UpliftingNews since this is a major win against big pharma?
How do I as a consumer get in on this billion dollar lawsuit?

I had a “Surprise Dependency” to prescription opiates.

I have come to learn after spending a whole house worth of money on opiates .  That it is in fact a addiction and I am indeed a opiate addict.

Right now I have 3 years 2 months and 15 days clean from opiates.  Unfortunately I had to learn a very long hard expensive late life lesson. 

Luckily I came out of it alive but there are many that aren’t as fortunate as me.
It's definitely legal

(I love seeing memes from video games on other subreddits.)
EA in the big pharma game!
> is the absolute worse face of capitalism

How about cigarettes? Or what about the pharmaceutical industry cranking up prices to outlandish levels for already profitable drugs people need to survive? I'm sure I could think of other examples...
What about the mass suicides happening among pain patients due to inappropriate opioid  medication cutoffs causes by overregulation that was caused by media hyping OD deaths and ignoring the suicides and premature deaths of neglected pain patients? And the people who have caused this deliberately to increase the profits of their rehab center networks?
It's the absolute worst face of capitalism _yet_.
400k people did not die from prescription opioids over the last 20 years, the literal peak of opioid deaths annually from prescription opioids was around 18k.  Additionally, the average opioid death had 6 drugs in the person's system, with alcohol being the number 1 culprit of additional drugs.  These deaths are from polysubstance overdoses, and an overall drug abuse crisis.  


Demonizing prescription opiates harms chronically ill people, as well as post-op patients.  I've had plenty of issues with pain management on both sides after not needing any over the past 7 years before the last year.  And while prescription opioids have been reduced dramatically since 2011, the overdose rate has skyrocketed, because prescription opiates aren't the problem, drug abuse along with a tainted illegal supply of drugs is the issue.  Less than 1% of post-op patients get addicted, and around 6% of long-term opiate users become addicted.  More people become dependent obviously, but dependence doesn't mean they shouldn't be on the drug.  Otherwise, you'd also want to take everyone off anti-depressants, anti-siezure medications, benzos, stimulants (including coffee), and a couple other medicines.  


Going after purely opioids ensures that you just harm the people that need proper pain management, while just pushing addicts to worse drugs such as street opiates or other drugs (like alcohol!).  I don't see any calls to go after cigarettes or alcohol, despite them providing no medical value.  However people like to use those drugs to relax and have fun, but have no issue going after drugs that allow people to live a reasonable quality of life they otherwise wouldn't get.  Purely because it doesn't affect them, and they've eaten up plenty of drug war propoganda.  


Were there pill mills?  Yes.  Did doctors overprescribe opiates for relatively minor injuries?  Yes.  We needed to reduce opiate prescribing in those cases, although transition many pill mill patients into substance recovery programs that would offer MAT (medication-assisted treatment such as methadone) in order to help those addicts stay alive.  What we didn't need is just blanket policies that take the nuance out of caring for a patient.  Many of us try plenty of alternative treatments, I spend around 2k a week and take 35 hours out of my week to do tons of alternative treatments.  And I still suffer extreme amounts and am very much in need of proper pain management (I get ketamine because they don't wanna prescribe opiates but ketamine doesn't last long and gets you insanely high).  None of these alternative treatments are covered by insurance, despite plenty of evidence in the NIH showing they help my issues.  So I pay a fuck ton out of pocket (thankfully can do because im rich), but expecting every chronically ill person (many of whom receive barely anything to live on disability) is absurd.  


Ignorance about prescription opiates hurts the most vulnerable people in society, and doesn't hurt addicts as shown by the statistics.  It makes plenty of people feel smart and like they're helping, and makes a couple industries tons of money.  But it is completely misguided.
Why does the legality of the drug matter? It’s not like they’re more dangerous. Addiction isn’t a matter of right or wrong choices or morality. In fact it’s been proven that legalizing all drugs vastly lowers the rate of drug related death, addiction and probably most importantly (and most obviously) incarceration.

You misspelled crapitalism.
Drug Dealers gonna Deal Drugs
When are they going to go after the doctors who are working against their patients interests. Seems like a pretty basic failure. If a lawyer did that, there'd be consequences. Docs are ramping up dosages rather than suggesting their patients take more over time. I'm not surprised some pharma giant is doing whatever it takes to sell, but I am surprised that doctors are willing participants in this scheme. They should be treated as drug dealers, put the fear of god in them. You shouldn't always focus at the top because that's where most of the money went.
I agree that the pharmaceutical companies marketed these drugs to physicians in an immoral manner, but they don’t prescribe.  I don’t see them ever losing this battle.  They created a product that is effective for pain relief.  It will be hard to prove that they convinced doctors in an illegal fashion in order to put these drugs in a proven addict’s hands.
Are we really surprised though?
nah. companies contributing to the majority of the climate change problem is actually the absolute worse face of capitalism and profit at any cost.
I disagree. I think that it is capitalism perfecting itself.
Fuck, people should be going jail for this. But they won't and whatever they pay will be change to them.
\>Getting hooked on illegal drugs and dying as a result is one thing but...

The stigma this attitude helped create is one of the primary reasons so many people have died in this crisis.  It doesn't matter whether someone got addicted to drugs because they liked to party in their teens, because their doctor gave them a script, or because they self-medicated to deal with mental health issues.  They are human-fucking-beings who deserve society's help.  

Instead of helping them we throw them in jail, we take away their job opportunities, we stigmatize them, we insult them at every turn, we spend MORE money than we need to in order to deny them clean needles, drug testing kits, and basic safety measures.  

And it's "one thing" when these MILLIONS of peoples lives are ruined by STUPID drug policies, but god forbid the soccer mom who really likes her pain pills gets pulled into the same system designed to abuse people society dislikes.

Its been pretty fucking clear for a pretty long fucking time that the war on drugs doesn't work and yeah, the big pharmaceutical companies are bad actors, but YOU are the real evil here.

Back then outrage could end a company, nowadays everyone is always outraged so news like that doesn't stick
HBS the was instrumental in making a former alumni of theirs look like a genius and savior for coming up with the solution to put the Tamper evident seals on the bottles. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. The tech already existed as did the ability to convert the manufacturing lines to add the seal. But it was never implemented because their Ceo said it cost too much money or it added too much cost and cut into their margins. Which is why they were able to implement the seal so quickly. 

With HBS and Harvard business review they were able to paint the ceo as something he isn’t. And they covered up and changed the narrative on the whole thing.
They stopped caring about quality long before 1982. They buried the truth about their baby powder being tainted with asbestos beginning in 1975.
Darwin's law is about to take effect.
To my knowledge McDonald's has never said "eat our big mac, it's healthy". That's the difference. Saying something isn't addictive when you know it is, isn't the same as selling something unhealthy.

Coke has gotten in trouble for saying Vitamin water is good for you when in reality it is a high calorie flavored beverage with a few added vitamins. I wouldn't call this a winning legal strategy in this instance.

I saw that and had to facepalm. You know someone got fired for saying that once they realized that all of those industries have and continue to get sued all the time for exactly those reasons.
Would be a start...
It’d be like if a drug dealer manipulatively got millions of people addicted to their special drugs and then asked the judge to throw the case out because they *totally* weren’t involved at every single stage. Actually it’s exactly like that.
THIS. I have chronic pain from a kidney disease and have been denied all pain management for 5 years with 0 help. It would be more humane if they just fucking euthanized us. This is deliberate large scale torture being normalized by pretending all pain patients are addicts
The media loves to hype the opioid crisis while it completely ignores the pain suicide crisis opioid overrestrictions have created.
I let them know about a defect in some sanitary pads and they sent me a large packet of papers in the mail demanding my entire life's worth of medical records.

That's SC Johnson that has that motto. Different company.
Because their baby powder isn't full of asbestos.
Those responsible for overrestricting opioid laws should be held accountable for every death they have caused. So far they have been held accountable for 0. I'm waiting, at least until I join the dead.
I mean, since that sub is all about using the disabled for your entertainment, sure. Why not use those in pain for it too. ^^/s
I need to know this too! It really put my relationships and family in a hard spot. I wasn’t addicted my husband was, and I’m still emotionally scared, can’t trust And in fear of this damn drug coming back into our lives.
It's not a class action lawsuits you can get in on. It's many single action lawsuits, this one from Oklahoma's attorney general, which may roll into a multi-district litigation (MDL) to be tried all at once. The proceeds, though, would hopefully be used to help people in your situation though
Out of curiosity, how did you become addicted?

>How about cigarettes? 

"So far tobacco companies have paid more than **$100 billion** to state governments as part of the 25-year, $246 billion settlement."

>what about the pharmaceutical industry cranking up prices to outlandish levels for already profitable drugs people need to survive? 

write your US senator and rep... keep the heat on and tell them to stop taking money from that industry

When the litigation is over the tobacco settlemwnt will pale in comparison to what Big Pharma is going to deservedly pay out.
Food industry can be pretty bad. They go out of their way to mislead people about how healthy and nutritious certain foods are, and the food pyramid was really just the food industry paying a lot of money to get the government to tell people to eat a bunch of their food.
The sugar industry misleading people about sugars and fats might have done the most long term damage. Or maybe oil companies about climate change. Or the NRA with guns.
Cigarettes never led me to stick needles in my arm, resulting the collapse of 90% of my major veins...
Nope still worse. Only worse face of capitalism I can think of is mothers selling their babies into prostitution. Thats more questionable and obviously illegal in most of the world now.
I do wonder what people pro-weed and other drugs feel about this.
I dont blame pharma for cranking prices. Because it is not their job to regulate the prices in the system we have, which is capitalism, and in that system, pharma has to make money, and uses that money to pay people and to develop new drugs. I have a problem that the government has allowed these prices to go so far into the crazy levels they have, and doesnt regulate insurance which causes most of the issues
they are also horrible. but you bringing up these other issues only marginalizes the point he was trying to make just so you can sound like you know some shit. mehhhh
I am not against reasonable responsible administration of pain medication. I am against "pill mills" run by shyster doctors who are in cahoots with the distributors and do not have a patient's long term care in mind.
Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.

-Edward Abbey
It's the absolute worst face of capitalism yet *that we know of*.
Not the whole "The planet is melting" thing?
This is a fair and valid point about an approach that demonizes prescription opioids in general, which I agree would be counterproductive in various ways, including, as you say, demonizing vulnerable populations and people who have few to no alternatives for pain control.  


But I think that there's a distinction between declaring that prescription opioids are evil in general, and holding specific corporations accountable for inaccurately representing the nature and risks of medications they sell. (To pick an obvious example, I think it's going a little far for a company lawyer to publicly compare prescription opioids to ice cream; it sells short not only the risks of opioids but also the benefits, and feeds into the discourse that says that people who take opioids do so because opioids are pleasurable for them--which I think is not always true--rather than because of the medical benefits of opioids). I think prosecuting Johnson & Johnson falls into that latter category, although the news coverage around the case is likely to stray into the former category.  


I would consider it equally valid to prosecute the manufacturers of every medication I personally take if they were publicly lying about the risks of those medications as J&J has done with opioids, even though I personally consider my medications worth the risks.
>Were there pill mills? Yes. Did doctors overprescribe opiates for relatively minor injuries? Yes.

And the manufacturers were absolutely aware of the quantities they were shipping to locations. One county in West Virginia got enough for 900 pills for each and every citizen of the county. Big Pharma is culpable as fuck.

>I don't see any calls to go after cigarettes or alcohol, despite them providing no medical value.

The tobacco industry has paid over $100 billion for their lies. Alcohol is culturally accepted and no prescription is involved or lies made about its potential for addiction. Hell for that matter I can make 150 gallons of wine per annum in my state. 

>Ignorance about prescription opiates hurts the most vulnerable people in society

I understand that personally as my wife recently was told the two narcotics she takes for pain management for her PAD disease and neuropathy was being reduced to one. The FDA has changed the law on administering narcotics. So there is a vulnerability associated with the national,response to the misuse of opiates.
Could we get some sources? I Google this shit, and come up with nothing but establishment narrative. I'm happy demonizing pharmaceutical companies, but if it isn't true here, I'd rather know it. My parents are getting destroyed by this war on prescription opiods.
I think it's a layered problem, where doctors are also partly to blame for. The US has a pretty crappy social system, where if you find yourself unable to work for a couple of days, a lot of employers will fire you. So people are indirectively forced to take those (comparably stronger/higher dosed) drugs to function enough to show up to work.   
If you for example take a country, that has paid sick leave, the doctors there would probably describe a milder pain killer that leaves a little bit of discomfort, but you can rest fully and in the end you don't need as much drugs as in the first scenario. Lower total amount of drug intake should also lower the possibility to get addicted and then be reliant of an illegal source of supply/substitutes.
legality of a drug matters because it is directly correlated to said drugs accessibility. a huge part of the reason cigarettes are such a threat to health is because they're at every gas station in every city. the same could be said about how opioids were distributed prior to the tightening of the regulations. you're absolutely right in saying that addiction is not a matter of morality however, and i do agree that legalizing every drug (as in the case of portugal)
doctors make way more money now off of patients than they did from prescription drug kickbacks.  One steroid injection makes them more money than over 2 years worth of monthly opiate prescription kickbacks.
A salient point. 👍🏻
Doctors are culpable, especially the ones running pill mills.
Watch the 60 Minutes interview of the lead attorney representing the plaintiffs. They have accessed corporate emails that clearly indicate the industry's awareness about the addictive nature of their product and their intent to capitalize on it.
In light of all the other scams, not really.
Equally despicable.
Does it need to be such a deadly process?
They have made a ton and the attorney from Mississippi who beat the tobacco industry and is representing several states says the Big Pharma payout will make the $100 billion paid by the tobacco industry look like chump change. 👍
>It doesn't matter whether someone got addicted to drugs because they liked to party in their teens, because their doctor gave them a script, or because they self-medicated to deal with mental health issues.

It matters when irresponsible medical professionals run "pill mills" doling out addictive drugs like they were "M&MS." They were a wad of money with no concern about someone's long term healthcare needs.
Generally speaking, no.
No, nowadays our governments, the apparatus of the people, are so thoroughly defanged they don't have the power to touch corporations when they fuck up.
Wow, that's... Wow. This is why I have exactly zero respect for famed corporate execs or "titans of industry". These guys price themself on "working so hard to build out country," but it's all a sham. They just work very hard to scam honest people, and/or get them hooked on drugs. Why they are admitted by the people around them boggles the mind.
Does asbestos hurt you when used topically?
Because having pain means you are an addict who deserves to die in today's America

Fuck you.
Also there isn't a respected profession telling people to eat Big Macs in response their physical ailments.
Even though they haven't, there have been plenty of suits over things like their salad. Rightly so too, when a salad has more sugar and calories than a big Mac, someone's fucking blowing smoke and needs a legal smackdown.
I am also pretty sure that if you ate 25 big macs at one time it wouldn't kill you...even it was just once,   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ0uDYdpHfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ0uDYdpHfs) (Competitive eater Matt Stonie eating 25 big macs in 22 minutes).  The lawyers defense is crap, the the judge knew it.
Look, all we did was make the drug, market the drug, go office to office to bribe the Doctors with cash, toys, and meals, have sexy salespeople repeating our lies, and rewarding the Doctors who prescribed the most...you can't blame us for that!
> I'm not sure public nuisance laws should actually your primary concern here, Mr Brody.

The only cause of action is based on public nuisance. Oklahoma dropped its claim based on deceptive marketing.
Bold strategy to list only positives.
Jesus Christ, as soon as I saw your comment I heard it in my head, oof! Thanks, will fix my comment. Apparently they don’t even have a slogan
Mind blown.
I did respond maybe something I said will help.
Oh that’s perfect!  It’s like the circle of life.

1. Big  pharm makes the drugs

2. Government gets more money than originally anticipated from big pharm.

3. Slightly help some people with something they could have prevented.

4. Big pharm makes a new drug to “help stop addiction”
Or New addictive drug.

5.  It starts all over again.
This one is already being tried.  The Oklahoma attorney general sued Johnson and Johnson alleging that the state has paid out billions in medical care due to the opioid addiction crisis.
If you take enough opiates or opioids for long enough you will develop withdrawl symptoms when you cease.  Unless you know what they [the symptoms] are, or have been educated on them, you may not even know that's what is happening.
First I had wrist problems eventually required surgery.
But a family doctor at the time would prescribe 100 Vicodin a month to me.

Then a friend would have 30 mg Percocet that we would party with on the weekend.  It started with a  1/4 of a pill then  1/2s, until I would snort 3 to 4 at a shot. @ $20-$30 a piece.

I am different than most because opiates give me energy.  So when it first started I would accomplish all things that needed to be done in life.  So the weekend turned into Thursday night too.  Then hey why not Tuesday.
Until I became physically addicted then I couldn’t get out of bed without them.

I was in such denial that I still thought I could stop at any time and I could do it on my own.  It took a few months of being clean till I actually realized what a mess my life had actually become.  I literally spent a house worth of money on them.  At the time I had no problem doing so.

It never turned into heroin, but I didn’t know at the time what I was using was just pharmaceutical grade heroin and stronger.
Does writing to representatives actually accomplish anything? How many of those letters are opened, read, and replied with a generic response from an unpaid intern or volunteer or worse yet, ignored entirely?
Do you have a source for that? I’d love to read more about that.
Definitely. There are so many industries with severe issues that it's hard to pinpoint one as the worst. How about hospital's and insurance companies severly rigging prices. That most certainly has killed countless people who found themselves unable to afford healthcare. Or maybe the combined education and student loan system crippling people with debt. It's not a lost cause, but we're in need of regulation and reform that hasn't happened since the great depression. Unfortunately, those kind of changes don't get made without catastrophes or revolutions.
Unregulated capitalism is fucking disgusting
>Sugar industry creating an obesity epidemic       

 

>Oil industry destroying the environment      




>NRA lobbying for Constitutional rights     


I'm not a fan of the NRA, bit holy crap one of these is not like the other.   The sugar industry blamed everything on fat and screwed up multiple generation's view on nutrition.  The oil industry knew about climate change and how far reaching the damage the environmental damage they were causing was, and buried the info.  What exactly has the NRA lied about in regards to guns?
[deleted]
AOC went in on pharma for using grants to fund R&D. These companies also aren't just getting by with razor-thin margins, their profits are pretty hefty.

Damn, that's a good one.
Something I didnt expect to see on reddit this year. Cactus Ed.

Quick I see a bulldozer that needs tipping over.
Corporations basically are cancer. That's why when people get all mad at corporations for pollution and greed and all thei bad behavior I chime in to try to remind people that collective action like voting and taxation and policy change are the only way to make corporations do anything. Finger wagging at the corporations themselves is just pointless.
What the hell? Like the USSR was zero emission?
That one's less capitalism and more a problem of humanity being greedy for a better life regardless of government or lack thereof.

Another guy pointed out other specific countries, but honestly, you think even *total anarchy* would have prevented global warming? Doesn't really matter the framework it's accomplished in, for better or worse humanity demands its right to advance.
It's the worst face of capitalism that negatively impacted the first world.
Yeah I agree with all of that
Tobacco has paid over 100 billion, but has made wayyyy more.  Alcohol being culturally accepted still doesn't negate my point about them providing no medical value.  Do you think patients and doctors were suddenly convinced opiates had no addictive qualities, throwing out over a hundred years of research, thanks to one pharma company touting one new opioid?  If so, then doctors shouldn't be trusted at all if they can throw out all that evidence just to appease one pharma company selling oxycontin.

I'm sorry about your wife, i'm in that group getting fucked as well as many others.  Those are the people that are actually harmed, and drug addicts are dying now more than ever (since prescription opiate crackdown).  The opiate crisis response has created an even worse crisis, and thats what i'm trying to show and subsequently solve by pointing out hypocrasy and common sense.

Am I advocating that opiates should be freely available and aren't addictive?  Fuck no, but i'm trying to keep opiates in perspective for everyone else.
The reason states are reaching with public nuisance and false advertising laws though is that even though they might be morally culpable, there was (and to my knowledge still is) no state that has a law forcing drug makers to control how many legitimately (as in through the legally allowed process) ordered drugs can be shipped to a given clinic/area.
https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006605.pub2/abstract  - source about chronic pain addiction rate (around 6% from long-term opioid therapy).

https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5790  - this is the source of less than 0.2% opioid addiction post surgery, and around 1% of opioid "abuse" (broader range than addiction, abuse could just be taking more pills for more pain relief due to undermedication).

Demonize pharma companies all you want, they certainly had a role to play in this and fuck americans over in many other ways (price gouging).  But to claim that they singlehandedly convinced doctors to throw away over a hundred years of opioid research plus experience and convince them that not only oxycontin wasn't addictive (which was a lie purdue pharma and sackler family definitely spread), but that all opiates had no addiction risk is pretty bullshit imo.

And if doctors were able to be persuaded, then maybe we need to rethink med school education.
"now". Why is that? What changed?
I didn't mean it in a good way. I mean that this is what happens when there is zero regulation on corporate greed. They will kill to make a buck.
And look at the tobacco industry. Thriving as usual.
Bullshit. Our government isn’t ‘defanged’—it’s *complicit.*

When it wanted to fuck with people over pot there was no shortage of gusto on behalf our state & federal institutions. But somehow they’re powerless against opioids? I’m not buying that. 

Start throwing corporate executives into fucking jails.
Except that J&J initiated the recall, so a change in governmental authority isn't the answer.
To be fair, I've never heard the phrase "captain/titan of industry" used unironically.
When being used, the talc/baby powder would get in the air and could be breathed in, leading to mesothelioma. It’s also alleged that since a lot of women used to use talc and baby powder to reduce chafing around their genitals that it entered their bodies and lead to instances of ovarian cancer.
J&J knew since at least the early 1970s through the 2000s that their product had tested positive for asbestos. Some documents are showing an internal concern about it since the late 50s.
After only a little googling I think the jury is still out, but it doesn't matter. Have you ever used baby powder? It gets in the air. J&J have lost billions in court over cancer claims stemming from baby powder use, and it's not necessarily mesothelioma but ovarian cancer.
Chill. Obviously not what he meant.
I think you misunderstand.

I'm not saying the drug users are going to get tested.

I'm saying these asshole CEOs and congressmen that can't let go of profits, are about to get tested.

By nature.  Something beyond their ability to bribe, influence, or ignore.

That's what I mean when I say Darwin's law.  They can't change that one.
That's an excellent point.
That's a great point, and very true.

They're pulling all their ridiculous arguments from tobacco companies:

>Johnson & Johnson challenged accusations that its marketing helped cause the opioid epidemic by saying that while ice cream sales and crime went up in the summer “that does not mean that ice cream causes homicides”. Beckworth said he was astonished by the parallel, calling it “offensive”.
I’m sorry to hear that. That’s horrible.
If you're lucky enough (read, your area is smart enough to elect) to have a rep that actually cares about you then maybe. But I can assure you that my reps from Kansas don't give a shit and they'll go unread or an intern will read them and send a generic response without ever mentioning it to the rep.
Not writing has a definite effect.
I always get a response and often a phone call.
At this point it's cheaper for me that if I have the time I would fly to England first for healthcare
It's not unregulated, it's just under-regulated. They come up with regulation just strong enough to keep up appearances, but just weak enough to be ineffective.
Just came back here after the most recent shootings to tell you to go fuck yourself.
That they would make people safe. Disarmament is the choice of any advanced country that don't want to have a huge homicide rate. The idea, not only that people should have guns, but any kind of guns, including semi-automatic weapons, even if they are mentally ill is monstrous. No other country has so much school shootings that are blamed on videogame influence instead of easy access to guns, lack of regulation, not enough exams to assert the mental competence and how responsible the persons buying guns are.

"Its the price of freedom, nothing can be done, regulation is evil, our thoughts and prayers to the victims." These are all evil statements. NRA is almost cartoonish evil on their defense of the gun industry.
Different level maybe, classy boy.
This are one of the areas i disagree with AOC on.

The Government only supplies a third of the biomedical research. 60% comes from the industry. The rest is private donations. And the government has no interest in producing the drugs. Which has its own costs, such as throwing away lots, updating equipment, designing the process for producing the drugs. I have seen a pharma company be months away from beginning making a new drug and canceling it due to failure in making the process work at large scale. They built a new building for it, and ended up shifting that building to something else, laid off a lot of people, and had to find a new use for the rooms that were going to create the actual vaccine. On top of that, standards are frequently becoming stricter (which they should), and this causes increase in operating costs and adjusting SOPs. 

&#x200B;

And their profits are hefty. But there are also a lot of risks in pharma. And the only reason they can make these profits are because of their large size, and constantly trading vaccine licenses. 

&#x200B;

Here's the thing. In the US, healthcare is not a human right (it should be, but it is not). So attacking pharma is attacking a symptom of the system, not the cause. Focus needs to be on fixing healthcare, not on symptoms, which pharma is the symptom
The most disgusting part of that article:

> Du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, had his sentence of eight years in prison for raping his daughter repeatedly between the ages of 3 and 5 as well as molesting his son starting at the age of 19 months, suspended by Delaware Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden. Why? Jurden thought the rapist “would not fare well” in prison. In 2009 Richards was placed on eight years' probation and ordered to attend an inpatient psychiatric program at MacLean Hospital in Massachusetts. As of April 2014 court records show that Richards has yet to appear for treatment.

3? 19 months? I have two children. How in the holy hell can you do this to a child THAT young? I mean they are still babies.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s horrible at ANY age! And then get off Scott free?
I wonder what else these pos judges have dismissed so callously since this was written in 2014.
 what's sad is is that he'll spend about 3 months in his county jail waiting to go. Then get to classification where he'll be sent directly to solitary confinement. By the time a state camp is issued too him he'll be released. Literally a slap on the wrist
/r/earthfirst there are dozens of us!
Pretty much confirms that humans are cancer too. Every bit of life, knowingly or not changes the environment it exists in. Human instinct encourages population growth despite understanding there are limits on the resources that support it. My question is are we cancerous given our propensity to mutate our environment, or a virus in that we reproduce until we destroy our host? Both?
Or China
How does whatabouism help here? Is the USSR still a thing? No. So why are you talking about it?
Climate change was not a serious concern until the last decade or so of the USSR. Even then, I'm using "serious" very generously. Yes, it was happening, but nobody really cared and the link to human activity was not well-established.
That kinda takes for granted the capitalist premise that a "better life" relies on material consumptions rather than things like not paying exorbitant rent prices because housing has become commodified, or not going bankrupt from medical debt because healthcare has become commodified, or not paying decades of student loan debt because education has become commodified.

A better life, to a lot of people, means having their basic needs met without pushing them into indenturement. 

As far as the oil companies go, capitalism is responsible for their destruction of the planet due to the lobbying power of corporations, the psychotic influence of the profit motive making them judge 50 years ago that they wouldn't kill everyone too fast to make money, and stifling innovation by using their influence to suppress alternative energy in the meantime.
Doctors stopped prescribing opiates, suddenly people's pain isn't managed at all anymore, so they go to doctors for relief.  They prescribe a ton of drugs with bad side effects and dependence as well, but it doesn't actually help their pain (lyrica, gabapentin, antidepressants, NSAIDs).  So they ask for something else, and they get told to get a spinal cord stimulator, injections (steroid or lidocaine), or to just fuck off and deal with it. 

I'm lucky enough to get ketamine in addition to getting a couple of shots in my dick for pain management a week, but my ketamine use is now causing permanent damage (and fucks me up being imagination while im on ketamine).  I very much need pain management to do anything since I have a hard dick 24/7 that doctors can't fix (try bending either your hard dick or your husbands and report back to me how painful that is and you'll understand my pain everytime I walk or go up/down stairs).  Opioids have helped, yet because I have such a weird and bizzare condition they won't write me prescriptions for opiates since the DEA won't buy that my condition actually exists.  Its pretty awesome
hear hear
But if they arrest the execs who's gonna pay for their beach houses?
Not just executives but investors as well
Yeah because back then they were fucking scared about the government shutting them down with fines.

Face it, unfettered capitalism is the problem.
It's been out of style for at least the past couple of decades, but it used to be a real thing. I think it may still be current in biographies and business journals, I wouldn't really know.
I usually see it in reference to people long since dead, like John D Rockefeller or Andrew Carnegie.
I know airborne is an issue. But just having it on my ballsack wouldn’t cause any issues would it?
Obviously I do.  I mentioned my ballsack.  However idk how you apply powder but I just pour some down the front of my boxers. Hardly any airborne particulates exit that place. Also, is it more harmful than all the car exhaust I inhale walking downtown or all the mold and mildew spores is sure I inhale while working? Not trolling honestly curious. 

Are there any law preventing this? Like can third party off brand powders still use asbestos?
If you wrote that into a TV show or a movie, people would think it's ridiculous and unrealistic.
Crime does go up in summer it's a thing
No need to be sorry.

I did it to myself.  I had fun, until it wasn’t fun anymore then it was horrible.

It started in 2006 and I got clean in 2015-2016

I have two beautiful kids a nice house two dogs and my wife and I are still together and clean.

Most importantly we now enjoy life without any substance and wouldn’t change it if we could. 

When we were drinking and drugging we never realized what a precious gift life was. (Sorry if it sounds cheesy but it’s true)

Is that effect any different than if you wrote? It seems like politicians are entirely out of touch with their people and only listen to their lobbyists. It seems like the only way to make a difference in politics is to have a shit load of money.
I've become part of the problem. After my last set of medical bills left me in debt (I thought I had decent insurance, oh man the stupidest stuff wasn't covered) I'm just not paying any medical bill I think is overpriced anymore. Fuck it, the system is rigged to screw me, I don't feel bad screwing the megacorps that are buying up all the hospitals.
Regulated by corrupt politicians*
/r/dgu
> including semi-automatic weapons

Hur durr. Pull trigger once, one bullet go out. BAD.
Here's the thing, those are all opinions, not fact.  They are all valid opinions, that are backed by logic, but they are still opinions.   There is not enough hard data backing those opinions to make them fact.     


>Owning a gun makes you safer is a lie        


The problem is that there are a massive number of self defense instances where a gun was used by the law abiding citizens every year, even more than the number of crimes committed depending on which study you believe more.  People's love HAVE been saved by private firearms use.     


Now you could get into statistics and gun ownership on a societal level, but that just opens several new cans of worms.  Looking at a list of the most dangerous and safest places to live in the US, you will find a mix of strict and lax firearms laws in the top of both of those lists.  Furthermore, while comparing crime statistics is difficult between countries since they are reported differently, there are many many cities in countries like the UK with extremely strict gun laws that are much more dangerous than cities located in places with extremely lax gun laws.  Even things like school shootings, which are unbelievably heinous acts, don't correlate to gun laws.  You used to be able to order machine guns from Sears catalogs, no background check or even age verification, shipped right to your door.  My dad used to bring his rifle to elementary school because there was a school marksmanship team.  But even with those incredibly lax laws, school shootings weren't a thing.       


As far as where society should be on the freedom vs safety scale, it's pretty obvious that any stance is going to be an opinion, not an objective fact.     


I also want to point out that the NRA is funded in a huge part by donations from individuals, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  That's just counting normal everyday people who have the *opinion* that the NRA is a good thing.  No one is donating $100 a month to opiate manufacturers thinking theyre good for society.      


So why am I harping on this so much?  Because by doing things like calling out opiate manufacturers, big oil, and gun ownership rights all in the same breath, you are actively damaging the chance for any progress to be made fighting things like climate change and the opiate crisis.  This is what has made those things partisan issues.  I come from a pretty right leaning family that lives in a heavily left leaning area, and I see and experience this constantly.  My yee-haw'in blue collar redneck parents, who unfortunately like most Americans don't search out non partisan news sources, have had their opinion on climate change heavily shaped by this.    

"Oh climate change?  The thing that our neighbors are always going on about? The same neighbors who called me a piece of shit ant told me I should be shot when they found out I own guns and hunt once a year?  Oh look, this politician is also calling for more effort to be spent combating climate change. Huh, they're also saying I'm a bad person for owing a gun.  Man, fuck these climate change people."        



FFS, we shouldn't be voting in politicians who are running on a campaign of dismantling the EPA at this point, yet here we are.  And a huge part of that is because people like you are calling other people evil for having a different *opinion* than you, and your average dumbass American who can't be assed to do their own research ends up voting Republican, because deregulation is now a partisan, opinion thing.      


I'm not hating on you having an stance on societal issues, or what that stance is.  But I wish we could seperate things like abortion or gun ownership, in which neither side is objectively evil, and things like the opiate crisis and climate change where one side 100% be taken out back and shot for the good of humanity.
Thank you for helping me understand the issue further. Appreciate the civility and clarity.
>Here's the thing. In the US, healthcare is not a human right (it should be, but it is not). So attacking pharma is attacking a symptom of the system, not the cause. Focus needs to be on fixing healthcare, not on symptoms, which pharma is the symptom

The priority being something else, like universal healthcare, or whatever you think the cause is, is irrelevant to the discussion of the prices of some medicines and exorbitant costs in relation to the rest of the world, even developed countries. Especially when it'll still be a relevant part when/if universal healthcare gets here to not get crazy expensive for the national budget.
Wow. That's no garden-variety “I swear she said she was 18” pedophilia.
Sick assholes.
Some people just cant wait to go to hell I guess
>Human instinct encourages population growth

Pretty much every animal's instinct encourages population growth.
Id say the older generations that are ignorant of their actions and the true consequences of their actions are still in power. These people have no concept of the shit they are doing to ruin others lives, just statistics brought on by a party they dont trust or have faith in. America is troubled by its two face agenda, promoting greed to be successful, but at the cost of the people below you or the cost of people who you'll never meet. These governors have no idea what the standard person goes through, or how the public education system actually is. They just get told information they choose not to believe.
China is probably the most capitalist country in the world. Far more so than the US.
> As far as the oil companies go, capitalism is responsible for their  destruction of the planet due to the lobbying power of corporations, the  psychotic influence of the profit motive making them judge 50 years ago  that they wouldn't kill everyone too fast to make money, and stifling  innovation by using their influence to suppress alternative energy in  the meantime.

None of what you just laid out can realistically be blamed on Capitalism itself. I know you and other Redditors will sneer at such an outrageous claim...but it's true. Greed is a human trait, it's been a part of the human condition since before we even lived in cities. 

Trying to blame all of the world's woes on Capitalism is just the height of college kid naivety. Shitty humans will be shitty no matter what kind of governance they live under. 

Would you mind pointing to the government system that completely eliminates the pitfalls of human nature? I'll wait right here.
That's just it, politicians are being bribed for *merely* a couple thousand, or maybe 100 thousand.  Meanwhile the CEO's are all multi-millionaires and billionaires.  Politicians **wish** they had beach houses...
why would you punish someone who was investing in drug production? it's not like people handed these companies money and said "go get everyone addicted" lol
If you can apply baby powder to your ballsack without getting any into the air around your body, then please patent the means by which you do so. I use talc-based powders frequently, and no matter what I do, there are always visible plumes. Not to mention the fact that if it's deposited on surfaces around the house, air currents can cause it to become airborne very easily. Pets and children, who hang out close to the ground, are particularly likely to get a whiff of stray powder.
First, you never mentioned your ballsack in our direct conversation.

Second, just because you don't see the particulates doesn't mean they aren't there. 

Third, pollution and mold are completely unrelated, but still a problem.

Fourth, the FDA put limits on asbestos found in cosmetic products in 1976. J&J sent the powder for testing, found some samples of talc were contaminated because of the source, and instead of reporting it to the FDA, flat out lied and buried it. There were *thousands* of internal memos discovered proving they knew of the contamination, understood that it can cause cancer, actively decided to hide it, do nothing to improve quality, and market it for use on babies.
Whether or not it's more dangerous to inhale asbestos than it is to inhale pollution/etc, it is definitely not only dangerous, but also unnecessary, and if you're releasing asbestos into your living space (which, no matter how solid ly protective your boxers are, if it's in your baby powder, you are), then you're putting others at risk.  


I don't think there's asbestos in baby powder any more, though--it was specifically in talc baby powder, iirc, anyway, and most of it is now cornstarch-based. Precisely because of the outcry around talc.  


I think the issue was contamination of the talc used, so possibly there could still be contamination, but non-talc powders would be way less likely to have asbestos. So, check the ingredients on whatever you use, then go online and see if there's been independent testing done on that brand, if there's talc. IMO that's more reliable than trying to figure out what, if anything, the FDA has done with a product.
It's been a trope for years: https://scrubs.fandom.com/wiki/Julie_Keaton
I just read it and I'm having trouble believing it.
Writing a handwritten letter is said to be the most effective form of contact.
Or regulated by good people with no budget.
Owning a gun actually does make people less safe though. People are far more likely to use a firearm against themselves than they are to ever use them in situations of self defense.
Absolutely. Unfortunately healthcare is a lot more complex than most people realize. For all the shows faults, Adam Ruins Everything has a really good segment on health insurance in the S which has directly contributed to a lot of our healthcare issues
Healthcare is free market right now.  With that type of system, pharma is encouraged to charge whatever they want. And the reason drugs are cheaper in other countries is because it’s regulated, so pharma makes most of its money in the US where healthcare is dominated by free market and not controlled
I get the point you're making, but India probably is, not China
Maybe a system that isn't designed to amass more wealth and power in the hands of the already wealthy and powerful wouldn't allow for the unimpeded cannibalization of our own resources in the pursuit of profit tho. Maybe the bare mechanics of capitalism make it obvious how prone it is to going full throttle into climate change.

Just because you try to set your goalposts up at some unimpeachable hypothetical you'd dismiss out of hand anyway doesnt mean you get to ignore the glaringly obvious pitfalls of our current system, the ones that directly led us to where we are today, the ones we all experience first hand.
Because they're financing it. Their constant demands for growth are what encourage such shitty business decisions.
Air borne asbestos particles aren’t dangerous to your skin. It’s the inhalation brother. I put the powder cap under my waist band, lil puff down boxers and close cap. I feel confident that any stray particles I may inhale would fall below the PEL for asbestos.
I apologize. Thought comment was visible to everyone on reddit. Interesting. So that means there’s more than likely sketchy asbestos powders all over.
Interesting. This concept and issue goes so so deep. I had no idea! TIL
Studies have shown upwards of 3 million instances of self defense with firearms per year. [Even people claiming those studies are flawed](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/13/602143823/how-often-do-people-use-guns-in-self-defense) and who believe the number of users is a fraction of that come up with numbers around 100k. Meanwhile, even the most hardcore anti gun stat sleeping group out there [only lists the number of suicides by way of firearms at under 22k](https://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/).    

You aren't only wrong, you aren't even in the ballpark.
I don't see where that disagrees with what I said.

Maybe "the cause is and how it should be fixed" would be better wording.

My point was that even if it's not part of the cause, it's certainly a big symptom that would need to be mitigated even if we got something like universal healthcare or again, whatever else you had in mind that would be the solution.
Still waiting to hear some meaningful proposals or something from you. You seem to think you have a perfect grasp of the situation and what's more, you seem to think you know how to fix it. 

So, let's hear it.  While you're at it can you point to any pitfalls that I've dismissed? I don't seem to remember dismissing anything about the current state of America. The only think I have dismissed is the idea that it is capitalism itself that is the problem, because that is literally just drivel that pseudo intellectuals, with nothing useful to contribute, love to spout.
The fact that you deny the function of capitalism as being the specific mechanism of the corporations' destruction of our planet kinda shows you either dont know how capitalism works, what it is, or what any alternative systems are.

You know what lobbying is right? You know how oriented around donor money the US electoral system is? You know capitalism increasingly caters to the power of the wealthy, like a black hole gaining mass sucking in all around it? 

Damn it sucks that theres not a single economic system that isn't structured around the unimpeded power of the wealthy...
THIS. THIS RIGHT HERE IS HOW I FEEL. 

Thank you.
Because non-capitalist or at least state controlled capitalism does so much better.

I'm sure I'll get hit with the "not real socialism/communism" take.

Regardless what about radical left wing political systems makes you believe that they'll do better in stopping human nature than what we have now?
That is fucking peanuts.
As an Ohioan, this is a fucking outrage.
How many people died in Ohio because of their crimes?
They are spending much more than that on their PR campaigns to preserve their image.
Chump change for these guys.
Do crime, make billions, get caught, pay millions.

And they say crime doesn't pay.

Liars.
I wonder how many politicians are on the dime with Johnson & Johnson?
A large high school now costs $150M. $20M will not pay for snow removal for one year.
A lot of misinformation here and JnJ being attributed behaviors other manufacturers commutes (Purdue). 

Johnson and Johnson is responsible for such comically low amount of opioid sales that even $20M seems high, if we are looking relative. Johnson & Johnson sources the raw materials, as a supplier, and distributed them to manufactures to be products. They made money because OTHER manufacturers were ordering the materials, doctors over prescribed and accepted kick backs, pharmacists didn’t question the script, payers continued to cover, etc. etc. etc. 

JnJ is not responsible for the direct increase in opioid abuse. If I make a product, but my customers use it illegally (sometimes), that is not my fault. The reason JnJ is being attacked for such a large amount is because they have the money. It is much easier to attack a giant pharma company than, say, a family doctor, mom and pop pharmacy, small pharma company that can declare bankruptcy. 

They have the money; they are on the hook.
that'll teach em. wtg justice system... how many executives went to jail again?
And how many people at J&J get jail time?
That wouldn't even cover J&J's office supply budget.

Somebody got a bribe.
That's all?  What a deal.
There are ~3000 counties in the US, so the precedent they set here could add up in the end.
None, they made a useful product, doctors prescribed it, people that wanted it used it. J&J is guilty of crimes, but the blood is on the doctor's hands.
Just wait til the talcum cancer lawsuits start rolling in...
Counties, 2 cases, not the entire series of lawsuits.
4th Quarter sales in 2018 where 20.4 billion (81 for the year). The settlement should be bigger.
So why do you think they paid?
[They deliberately misled the doctors.](https://kfor.com/2019/08/26/judge-announces-opinion-in-historic-opioid-lawsuit/)

"they were told by their own experts that marketing opioids on their abuse potential was dangerous and that Purdue had already shown that such a message was prone to mislead. They were told that the data they cited did not support their claims before they made them, and then again by the FDA after they had already started spreading that misleading message," the ruling states. "They knew the studies they were citing were incomplete, unsound, or fraught with misrepresentations. The Defendants' sales reps delivered those messages, and as the call notes and the sales trends demonstrate, Oklahoma physicians were influenced by the misleading messages Defendants were delivering."
Do you not understand how pharm sales work...or even that there are people out there actively selling these products to doctors?  J&J pushed these opioids to doctors with lies about how they were not dangerous.
Sales != Profits. Their net income for 2018 was $15.3b

3000 * $20m = $60b. If enough counties sue and get roughly the same settlement, J&J will feel it.
Why are sales relevant at all? It's a settlement, not a fine.

And J&J is barely a player in the opioid industry to begin with.
Why should it be bigger though the company is like 1% of the opioid market in the country lol
You have to do the math, you were provided the numbers, you're ignoring them to make a statement.
Risk Mitigation
It's often more cost effective to settle than go to trial and let a judge/jury determine your guilt and how much you should pay.

Not saying J&J is completely innocent here. Just saying it could have been $100M or it could have been $0 if it went to trial
We have a system of laws that attempt justice. It's a good one, but only a system of laws.
Someone has to stand between the patient and the drug companies. To some extent it's the legal system. But even more so it's the doctor. Are you saying doctors have no responsibility to monitor the effects of drugs they prescribe?
And who is in a position to see the effects of the drugs?
I'm saying sales to be clear it wasn't profit. It is a settlement but I'm saying they could have got more.
[removed]
So your system of laws means that a company who hasn't done anything wrong agrees to pay $20M to kill a lawsuit?
Are you suggesting that doctors should all run their own clinical trials?  They rely on the information they are given from people who aren't supposed to be lying through their teeth.
They do, but when they are told the long term effects are one thing how do they really know without doing studies themselves.

Really the failure lies in the committees who looked at the trial and said yes this looks good when it was obviously manipulated and fake. That's not just illegal, it is evil as hell. Someone somewhere chose to suppress the truth because they knew real profit would be in the addiction. Beyond messed up imo
You can’t throw the book at everyone who goes to court.
I'm not necessarily saying they haven't done anything wrong, but our system of laws certainly has this (and greater) injustices built into it. 

$20M is a very small amount to them. Court costs and lawyers would easily exceed this over the long, drawn out process, even to defend against a meritless lawsuit. And still, there's a risk it goes to court and you get a jury sympathetic to the plaintiff that makes you pay even more, despite the facts.

It's often cheaper to pay what is essentially legalized extortion than to fight it, and most businesses do this. 

Again, I'm not saying they're innocent. But to say "they paid something!", therefore that's an admission they're guilty, is absolutely not how our justice system works. It's first and foremost a business decision to limit liability, and likely a wise one.

People also plead guilty to crimes they haven't committed for the same reason.
I'm not going to defend J&J because I'm not familiar with this specific case, but companies settle for millions all the time even when they have hard evidence supporting they aren't guilty. Why? Because bad PR costs significantly more. You can win the case, but lose tens of millions because the media has been generating damning headlines for weeks. Even if you win the case, the headline reads "Johnson & Johnson wins court case after leaving trail of OD's in these small Ohio towns".

This is why unlawful termination suits tend to be effective. It's cheaper to settle, pay the employee a trivial amount, and put them in a legally binding NDA. The cost of that employee going to the media and generating news articles can quickly cost the company millions.
I did not say "hasn't done anything wrong" - they did. But the deaths were caused by doctors.
No, but patients vary and doctors should carefully monitor their patients.
Agreed, now who is the watchdog catching these businesses before it becomes an epidemic? Or are you suggesting we just believe the companies until there is a big enough problem the news notices it?
I still see their baby powder on the shelves. Did the tainted versions get pulled?
When big companies like this have to “pay” these large sum of monies, where does the money actually go? What is it used for?

Edit: okay I get it, it’s not technically a large sum of money for a company of this size. 
They had the chance, many many years ago, to switch to corn starch, but chose not not. Said the fragrance didn't match their signature smell.







They chose poorly.
Can I get some context on this?  The article just says it contains asbestos.  But the comments are all about putting actual talc on, as if THAT causes cancer.  
   
Can I use talc or no?
That's it? Anyone born before 1970 put that shit on their soft parts 
" J&J denies allegations that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that its talc is safe and asbestos-free. "

" The New Jersey-based company is likely to appeal the verdict, which was made in California Superior Court in Oakland."

Seems unlikely they will just let this go, or it will open the flood gates to further cases against them. 
Like 29 million dollars is going to do anything for a company with a net worth of $360 billion
It's frustrating that people substitute civil trials for science. Because the fact is there is no scientific evidence that J&J baby powder causes  cancer.

A [civil trial does not have the burden of proof that science does.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/monsanto-glyphosate-roundup-baby-powder-talc-cancer-jury-verdict-1.4798419)

> "By no means should anybody take that to mean that it's now been demonstrated that those things cause cancer. That's not what a court is designed to do,"
>
> In civil litigation, jurors are told to weigh the evidence differently than a scientist would. They don't even have to decide "beyond a reasonable doubt" as they would have to do in a criminal case.

Having the jury decide science is like having Jenny McCarthy decide science:

> Did the exposure cause the plaintiff's cancer?  "I'm not sure, but I think so" is the answer one of the groundskeeper's lawyers, Brent Wisner,[ told](https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Johnson-Day-Eighteen-A-8-7-18.pdf)jurors they needed to reach in the glyphosate case. "That's really the standard here," he told them.

If you believe that Johnson&Johnson baby powder causes cancer you are the equivalent of an anti-vaxxer:

- Did the vaccine cause the plaintiffs autism?
- I'm not sure, but I think so.

Don't confuse the results of a trial with science.

- Science has a high bar to meet
- believing Johnson's & Johnson's baby powder is causes cancer is simply wrong

-----

But back to the facts. All talcum powder contains trace amounts of asbestos. In the same way the air you're breathing contains trace amounts of plutonium. And the water you're drinking contains trace amounts of uranium.

The question isn't whether it contains asbestos. The question is whether it contains an amount of asbestos that is dangerous.

> I'm not sure. But I think so?

No. Absolutely not.

I was trying to explain this a few months ago when the trial verdict came in. And there was a redditor who had zero tolerance for asbestos. He couldn't understand the concept of Trace amounts. Meanwhile they're perfectly happy to eat of radioactive banana.
That's like me getting a 5 cent ticket for going 200 over the speed limit.
I can't believe I've been putting this up my ass for years

So should I stop putting this shit on my balls in the summer?
Asbestos? I'm baking muffins asbestos I can!
The $29 million was ordered to carry the warning “money has been know to cause cancer in the state of California.”
Jury has ordered J&J to pay the lady. But there is no proof that the product and not a third party has introduced the asbestos, claims J&J. 
Maybe this is a stupid question, but why doesnt talc in things like face powder have the same cancer causing issues that baby powder does? 
As an esthetician I’ve used talc based baby powder (tried to switch to cornstarch and had a few people that were allergic so I switched back) on my clients as part of waxing prep for the last 16 years. Not usually the J&J brand but still, I’ve breathed in a lot of damn baby powder. Have any other companies been tested? Or is it a safe bet that Johnson & Johnson is the parent company of many of the baby powder manufacturers? Should I just go ahead and assume that I’ve probably been exposed to asbestos at some point? 
How about Gold Bond? I haven't seen any news but don't their extra strength powders still use talc?
Most of y'all haven't even read the article. 
Oh darn one day of profits lost. 
I swear I just saw an ad from them that ‘our talc is safe’
Basically everything causes cancer at varying rates. I can't imagine miniscule levels of asbestos in talc have had much effort. But muricans do love a lawsuit
Nothing goes together like California and Cancer claims...
[deleted]
[deleted]
29 mil that’s probably like losing a few dollars. 
For J & J, this is just a cost of doing business. A drop in the bucket. 
I don't think companies that knowingly cause cancer should continue to exist but I'm crazy.
I've put that stuff on my BALLS, man!
Does any of this apply to Goldbond? That’s safe, right?
Sold more powder than Johnson & Johnson

Keep it simple, should I stop putting this shit on my balls after I shower?? 
“J&J also lost a motion to reverse a jury verdict in Missouri that awarded more than $4 billion to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company’s products.”

To be clear, this is a different case mentioned in the article... but how could the talc, even if there is trace amounts or more asbestos, cause *ovarian* cancer? As a Geologist, my understanding is the risk of cancer from asbestos (which is a crystal shape, not a mineral) is pretty much related to *inhaling* the asbestos crystal shapes into your *lungs*, and the risk is primarily (if not entirely) lung cancer. The crystals cause cancer because they actually rip up cells and cause DNA damage... so how would it be possible to affect the ovaries like this? I understand women apply the powder to their genitals, but what is supposedly the mechanism allowing the mineral to travel all the way up the vagina, into the uterus, up the fallopian tubes, and into the ovaries? In the lungs, the asbestos is carried in by the negative air pressure to the ends of small air passages. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html

Seeing as there has never been a clear link, even among talc minors, to asbestos related cancer (from a lung study), I think it’s absurd to demand J&J pay anything - I don’t think there’s evidence that the talc is causing cancer. Especially ovarian cancer. I know a lot of people are claiming the jury may have more evidence proving a link for this particular case but it wouldn’t be possible with one individual to show a proper relationship. No actual case studies have conclusively shown a cancer risk. Additionally there’s not even a mechanical explanation for the transports of the minerals to cause ovarian cancer in addition to the lack of evidence. 

To me it seems like there are frankly scientifically illiterate people making these verdicts. 
Dad slapped this stuff on his balls daily. The bathroom was covered in it.  And he’s still kicking. Contributing nothing to society. Life is strange. 
Fuck it im gonna cover myself for weeks until i develop skin cancer so i can sue these fuckers for 40$ million and leave that to my family. 
Guys, guys this is such an overreaction! It’s not like [Johnson & Johnson has a history of knowingly selling harmful products to consumers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-tylenol/tylenol-maker-to-pay-25-million-for-selling-metal-contaminated-drugs-idUSKBN0M629S20150310), right?!
$29 Million a little on the low side, no? 
I dunno johnson and johnson has always pampered my timbits nicely.
I have a client that does chemical warehousing for numerous companies including J & J. He was saying how this talc issue is only an issue because the government sided with a few scientist views on if it caused cancer. A large portion of scientist say the opposite, but it’s not about what’s ethical, it’s about what the government says. 

I’m ignorant to this stuff. I will side the ga tech nerds that I communicate with about this though. 
What’s a good alternative then? Have they fully switched to cornstarch now then?
I had a surgery called pleurodesis, lung surgery and they used talc as the chemical agent. 

Without baby powder, what am I going to do about my sweaty balls? 
You telling me I have been giving myself taint cancer this entire time?
Late to this thread but my mom died of ovarian cancer and normally used the talc. My uncle blames it on Johnson and Johnson. How could it even be proved this was the cause of her cancer or even that she used the talc at all? This was nearly 15 years ago.
How about some fuckin prison time?
$29M. Woop-Dee-Doo. For a company like J&J, that's like equal to people like us getting a speeding ticket for $5.00.
Jury decides, not scientists. 


Remember California decided Starbucks coffee caused cancer?
Greaaaat ive been using J&J baby powder on my croch everyday for the last ten years, at least, am i fucked? 
Considering the science behind the claims is really weak, this is kind of shocking.
29 million... i am sure that's a drop in the bucket


2018 they did 81 billion in revenue 

29 million isn't going to hurt for long.
Johnson leans to the other Johnson and whispers "lmao that's chump change"
My grandmother, who used this powder daily for years, passed of ovarian cancer in 2005. This makes my heart heavy. 
But all talc contains asbestos. This isn't evil J&J trying to cause cancer, it's just how it is.

There are studies about talc and cancer precisely because it's known that it may contain asbestos. This wasn't a secret or anything.
Does it still contain asbestos? 
Another example where the punishment will in no way deter the company from future recurrence. J&J’s net earnings last year were $15.3bn so this is <0.2% of that. 
There is no reason to even buy this stuff. Just use corn starch.
How many cancer treatments will that cover?
Whats a brand that sells talc thats actually safe? 
Who does this money go to?'
Respecting those who fell victim
Some one called Stephen P. New...
I'm confused by this as well.
You looking for the real stuff? If so meet me in the dark alley behind denny's tomorrow night at 1 am. 20 bucks a bottle.
Jury decided, not scientists...so maybe it’s not entirely true but the attorneys are good at persuading? 
Juries get to decide who gets awarded money but the science is decided in the peer reviewed literature.

There are a lot of people freaking out in this thread but there is little to no evidence that talc causes cancer.

There is nothing special about J&Js talc which makes it contain more asbestos than other varieties since it is tested for asbestos by the FDA and had been found to be safe.

This case was decided by a scientifically illiterate jury on the basis of a warning label that was added to the MSDS of one of its suppliers in 2006 but that supplier (Imerys) was likely just covering it's arse because you can find a few papers claiming to link talc to cancer but you can find many more papers claiming to find no link or claiming to find a negative association. 
There is no tainted version. 

The US FDA conducted a study from 2009 to 2010 that checked 34 different talc cosmetic products, including baby powders, and found no asbestos fibers. Another study of earlier powders in the 1960s and 70s also found no evidence of asbestos.

This is just another case of a scientifically illiterate jury deciding on a scientific matter.
If they stop using talc, it should be fine. Harvesting talc is linked with asbestos for a lot of reasons, if I’m remembering it right talc and asbestos occur side by side or they’re interwoven. It’s almost impossible to have talc without a little asbestos in it, but J&J should have been able to process enough of it out of their product. I’d just steer clear of talc powder, and J&J products in general.
They haven’t used the tainted stuff for a long time, but they used asbestos-tainted talc even longer before that. 
Considering it naturally occurs in talc deposits. The answer is no 
If it has talc in it it might have asbestos too.  Talc and asbestos are both substances mined from the earth.  They often appear together in the same location.  This is what brought attention to the talc-asbestos-risk problem in the first place.  Will you find asbestos in your talc containing product?  Probably not.  Will someone, eventually?  Yes, probably.
The store I work at damn sure hasn't issued a recall for J&J baby powder in the 5 years I've been working there. Oh and I'm pretty sure that they made way more than $29 million in sales of the cancerous batch worldwide. So who is really being punished here? Damn sure ain't Johnson & Johnson.
The issues with them stem from previous product that was asbestos contaminated, and they hid that fact. The big issue at play is that when they realized they did make the effort to switch to talc mined without contamination, but hid the fact they had sold contaminated product. The product now is safe, and independent tests have confirmed that
Baby powder is usually 100% corn starch. I think the talc is in fem products like Shower to Shower and Summers Eve
Piggybacking on the top comment as I feel it's important to mention makeup also. TONS of makeup has talc in it. How worried should we be?
Typically 1/3rd goes to the lawyers.  From there, it depends on where you live.  Most of these cases it goes to the estate (living family members) of the people that have died from this.
asking the real questions. Just like when agencies get fined. 
Lawyers fees. 
$29 mill? Nowhere. Lawyer fees and small class action pay outs maaaybe. I'm not a lawyer. But I work in the corporate world and a 29M loss is a small failed project no one cared about, that cost some middling director their job. 
Not to people that actually used their product.
Large.

This is, as a single incident, equivalent to a parking ticket.
Ha! “Large”

That might cover two days of coffee for the office...
That's the fucking excuse? 
So....the fragrance supposedly contains asbestos? How the hell would that have worked?
So if you’ve been using this powder for years, and got cancer do you get anything? 29$ M is really nothing.
Chose poorly? $29 million is nothing. It was a business decision.
So what? What they're ordered to pay is basically a blimp in their vault. 
Don’t they have a corn starch version. My mom knew of this for many years and only bought the corn starch version of it.
Can you explain to me how the judge awarded this compensation (probably not the correct term)? Or is the part about j&j saying that numerous regulatory bodies declared it not causing cancer false?
Yikes. Baby powder smells like ass, IMHO. Maybe they should reconsider...
Corn starch also doesn't work as effectively as talc for drying on the skin... 
Guess their gamble paid off because $29 mil is nothing for such a massive company 
It’s a shame $29M is a drop in the bucket for them and in the end I think it still worked out for them financially.
Look up Dupont using C8 in teflon, they survived decades without much of a legal issue. There's nothing different with J&J making The Best powder /s
Some talc mines are naturally contaminated with asbestos. The baby powder mentioned in the article was tested and found to be contaminated with asbestos at one point. It's hard to know how much contamination there actually has been over the years. Also, there's still some doubt out there and studies being done as to whether pure talc can cause cancer, but the asbestos-contaminated kind definitely can. 

https://www.asbestos.com/products/talcum-powder/
its safe.  talc and asbestos can appear together, what they have used for talc for a long time does not.

No one else after 1970 puts it on their privates? Isn’t that where you’re suppose to put it? 
Shit. Anyone before 1995...
Before 1970?
That makes no sense, I'm pretty fucking positive people are still using this harmful substance. 
Judgement was for just one woman, other people have been suing too.
It's actually [in the billions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/johnson-johnson-talcum-powder.html) so far. The one post is just a new lawsuit.
I use arrowroot powder, works so much better and no cancer

It's worth noting that the risk comes from inhaling it. Putting it on your "soft parts" is completely safe. The difficulty is doing that without inhaling at least some of it - and by virtue of it being scented - that's pretty hard to do.

Thank you for this post. I think a lot of people are forgetting that the first major civil suit that set this ball rolling was based off a woman who would coat almost her entire body in talc every single day. She was then surprised when her cysts/tumors had traces of talc in them and sued J&J.  Even the most inert substances will trigger reactions in the body at too high of concentrations. 
Most underrated comment in this thread. 
Yea but you're a non-millionaire+ civilian. So no go.
Yeah, but this is one of thousands of cases J&J is having to settle.

So it's more like the equivalent of thousands of potential 5 cent tickets.
Not really. Perhaps more like *potentially* - but not to a scientifically valid standard - going 200 over the speed limit. In fact, how fast you're going over the limit is decided by non-experts in a state known for siding against people driving over the speed limit, even if they're not actually going over the speed limit.

It’s actually cheaper to use corn starch, which is literally cheaper than dirt 
https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html

So it seems asbestos and talc can be found together, but that is not always the case. However, some talc being used for talcum powder have been found positive for asbestos.
 Asbestos= always cancer positive
Babypowder= may or may not always. Results were mixed.

As for right now, the American association for cosmetics and other shiz said they made *voluntary*  guidelines on what how much asbestos can be found in talc used in products. But as mentioned above, research was inconclusive anyway. They couldn't prove it didn't, and couldn't prove it did.

So... I don't recommend it unless you want to take the risk. Safe alternatives include cornstarch, arrowroot powder, tapioca powder, etc. Brb while I throw my baby powder out. :(

Edit: I should mention breathing in fine particles such as talcum powder can cause lung cancer. (Which includes alternatives.) So just be safe if you choose to use products like these and take it out of the container carefully.

Edit2: https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm293184.htm I checked the FDA's response as u/hardolaf suggested. The FDA checked 34 cosmetics that included talc, which include the samples that 4 out of 9 talc suppliers gave upon request. All of them had no levels of asbestos that they could detect. The FDA concluded that the results were informative, but " they do not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination." 

So I think it's safe to say that they are generally safe! 
I'm extremely confused by the thread. I take that the corn starch version is safe. But do we keep using the talc version or not? What healthy alternatives do you have? 
I just rewatched that video the other day. Still hilarious.
Shoes, shoes, shoes, oh my god shoes
It does. This is the mainstream target. 
If you've been alive at all in the past 5 or 6 decades you've probably been exposed to small amounts in one way or another anyways. Old buildings were filled with it and I wouldn't trust how secure it was..
Everyone's baby powder isn't 100% safe. No one knows which one contain  asbestos because not all of them are contaminated with asbestos. This makes the testing for asbestos in talcum powder very mixed even though companies put out 'voluntary' guidelines to how much asbestos can be in talcum powder. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html

Breathing in fine particles such as talcum powder can cause lung cancer and since you use it a lot, maybe you should get a mask or the like. Keep it away from your nose when you apply it?

Edit: https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm293184.htm

So I think it's safe to say that they are generally safe! (Literally anything causes cancer these days so it's just a matter of how much it is.)
No one is alleging Johnson's baby powder contains asbestos today. All these cases deal with product used in the 60s-80s because of the latency period for mesothelioma.
Not even. They make 41 million a day
It probably is, now. This was in response to asbestos-contaminated talc, not the talc itself.

There are other non-talc alternatives if you want to continue powdering without any worries. Chassis makes one, Fromonda makes another, & “Dude powder” have good reviews.
Based on the last decade or so, I just assume every substance on earth is thought to cause some form of cancer. 

It’s strange these types of things make it to court though. 
Companies don't know things; people do.  The people that knew about it should be removed.
Well shit dude you might have ovarian cancer now 
No.  Most of the scientific literature says it's safe
There is no scientific basis it seems this civil jury just acted on emotions not proof. Shame what our society is deteriorating into.
I never understood how they let Children's Tylenol get so fucked up, that it required many recalls, to the point they stopped making it for a long while.

What the fuck was going on? Incompetence? Greed to cost cut? Sabotage?

How the hell do you allow a money maker like Children's Tyenol get fucked like that??
It's $4.7 billion in total to 22 women.
This [link](https://www.asbestos.com/products/talcum-powder/)  states that medical grade talc is sterilised and reported to be asbestos free.
It hasn't been proved.  It's a civil case, basically decided on a whim
Well, if you've been using baby powder produced before 1970, then you are likely fucked.
Sooo companies should definitely not be selling products with asbestos in them... i think its pretty reasonable to expect something i can buy at shops wont contain asbestos
This is why all fines etc should be based on % of income. Thats the only way to punish everyone equally, be it a poor or rich person, or poor or rich company.   If not, then it pays to do the crime, and that is surely not the intention?. or who knows. America is run by companies. 
In the US? Five, six tops.
It now uses corn starch. At least the lavender scented one does.
My testes need asbestes
That reminded me of a French chef I met in San Francisco who had an illegal cheese hookup. He would meet him in a van in an alley and come back with yummy non pasteurized cheese.
20 bucks for a bottle of cancer? What a steal!
That is the case many times when things go to court.  
Each side shows their own scientists and their evidence or studies, and the one most influencing the juries, is the one that wins. Not every time the real unbiased fact science wins.
That's exactly the case. There hasn't been an actual payment given since they get overturned at appeal but that gets less coverage because it's easier to bash on the evil Pharma corporation
Have you noticed how the claimant's attorneys make a special effort to select jurors who are not too intelligent and who are most likely to swayed by emotions rather than by common sense? So it looks as if these claimants really did get a jury of their peers!
It's like that Monsanto Round Up janitor cancer case. The science is in and has been, round up does not cause cancer. Jury decided to award the guy millions anyways.
“Little to no evidence” so you’re saying there’s a chance. Is that why there’s a cancer warning on my talcum powder?
[removed]
Didn't the industry get FDA to use an inferior type of test that couldn't detect smaller fibers, and other tests *did* find asbestos fibers, and I think even J&J execs buried internal docs to that effect. It's been awhile since I read about this.

You can't be too credulous about the fact that they got a regulatory approval if you know anything about how that stuff works.
I think the FDA recently recalled Claire's cosmetics for asbestos contamination 
It’s usually more than 1/3 if it reaches trial. It’s usually 1/3 if the case settles before a lawsuit is filed and gets higher the farther along the case gets. 
Usually, when lawyers work on contingency they get somewhere between 33-40% of the judgment plus costs incurred (filing fees, mediation fees, etc.)

The winner of cases where the lawyer isn't paid upfront usually get about half of the judgment when all is said and done.
This wasn't a class action suit. Payout to one person.

Lawyer contingency fee probably will eat up 40%. No idea about costs, but I think assuming another 10% is safe.

Still a $15 million payout at the end.
Exactly. They made hundreds of millions, if not over a billion, on this product over the decades. This is a fucking slap on the wrist that, once again, fucks over consumers while teaching abusive corporations nothing.
That was the excuse they gave us, but I'm guessing cost was the real excuse.
brand recognition is a helluva drug. though at this point you got to wonder how much it's really worth, if they keep hemorrhaging cash on these lawsuits
There's a reason it's called asBESTos. All the best products have them, look it up.

Talc can contain asbestos. It’s frequently in the same mines. 
Asbestos smells delicious.
The problem is Talc is a mineral and forms in very similar conditions as asbestos... so they are often found together.
Asbestos has a different smell than corn starch. Switching from asbestos to corn starch would alter the fragrance of their product and they didn't want to do that. 
This $29M is just for one woman. There are thousands of lawsuits outstanding with several others that have been settled or had judgments against J&J. Since these aren't class action, each person who might've been affected will have to take their own action, but that is probably better since class action suits often pay far less than individual settlements might.

All that said, the company will still be appealing this verdict and it might get reversed since regulatory bodies have said their talc powder is safe and these jury verdicts are somewhat frequently overturned. 
I would settle for even 1 M. 1 M is much money when you are on disability due to lousy health. Ovarian cancer is a silent killer. Stage three here and it was accidentally found though I at one time had stage one.So hard to diagnose. This time my oncologist did not think I had the cancer again. After needle biopsy he said same cancer as before stage three. He is a great MD I put all my trust in him. Just love the guy. 
How is this upvoted? There have been billions of dollars of judgements against J&J for this exact reason over the past couple of year and the number is only going to get bigger.

Women should not use the silicate-based talc and use corn-starch, but my balls hate the fucking cornstarch and only like the silicate.
Yes for many years now. Talc has been linked to cancer for a very long time. 
*All* Talc mines have asbestos.  It's just a matter of how much.  The reason is because asbestos is really just a specific mineral formation, and *will* occur under the conditions that create talc.
Those tests happened back in the 70s and were found to have methodological flaws. 

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a study from 2009 to 2010 that checked 34 different talc cosmetic products, including baby powders, and found no asbestos fibers. Another study of earlier powders in the 1960s and 70s also found no evidence of asbestos.

This is the type of evidence presented at this trial:

https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39711/was-it-only-johnson-johnson-which-hid-the-link-between-its-talcum-powder-and-c

This is all about J&J being aware of some studies that show a link between talc use and cancer but the mere existence of these studies doesn't tell you much when the vast majority of studies find no link or even a negative association. 
J&J says that their talc has always tested asbestos-free, so on what grounds are the accusations made?
lol... probably the only skeptical comment in this entire thread. Well done. 
The weakness of this broad statement is that it does not take into account quality control measures.  They cite that talcum containing asbestos DOES cause cancer and that talcum without asbestos is safe.  Fine, talcum alone is safe, but what are the preventive measures in place to ensure that regular batches of talcum are tested to be asbestos free?  For example, alcohol production facilities must test every batch of alcohol to ensure it is safe for human consumption.

It is quite possible that J&J does have preventive measures in place, but there is nothing in this article or the news report indicating this is the case; therefore, one should not jump to the conclusion that the product is safe.
No! You're supposed to put it in your hair to absorb the oil in between washes 
Anyone before [insert year I was born].
I know right? No one was born before 1970. Everyone knows this. We got a phony here. 
It no longer contains talc. Almost all commercially available baby powder nowadays is cornstarch-based. 
These people are suing for ovarian cancer though pretty hard to get that from inhaling powder. 

I have a hard enough time imagining how powder got all the way up to the ovaries from the traditional route. 
Can you explain how inhaling talcum powder gives you ovarian cancer, like the woman in the case?
No the women who blame their ovarian cancer on baby power are pretty much shoveling that shit up in their nether regions.
The jury was scientifically illiterate. The evidence of talc causing cancer is inconclusive at best. To convict on the current studies that we have right now is insane. Knowing about a couple studies that sugges a link between talc and cancer isn’t an indication of guilt especially when there are numberous studies that indicate otherwise. 
Not so much about money...yet. Its the brand that might be in some real trouble.
They actually make $41M a day: [$15.2B in net income for 2018](https://quotes.wsj.com/JNJ/financials/annual/income-statement).
Up *YOUR* ass?
Imagine trying to treat chafing and rashes unknowingly raising your chances of getting cancer. 
You're fine.  This case is ridiculous 

You have to inhale asbestos for it to cause mesothelioma, and refined or purified talcum powder doesnt have asbestos in it.  Plenty of houses, businesses and schools have asbestos insulation, or perhaps this is from inhaled talc/asbestos from before they switched to the purified formula, *which happened back in the 70s.*  

[deleted]
welp I used it for my acne and was exposed to inhale it, I‘m scared now
Maybe As long as you dont Inhale it.  Wear a face mask lool  , once it's in your lungs it stays there and builds up. 


In profit or revenue?
but corporations are people
Greed. It’s greed. 
Thanks for the info
The amount of asbestos in talc is pretty low. Otherwise everyone would develop cancer as babies.

Refined sugar, smog and specially smoking are way worse for everyone than talc will ever be. Which is why I find this lawsuit hilariously ridiculous.
The German version of Johnson & Johnson (Penaten) still lists the ingredients for their classic baby powder as "talc, perfume". Guess what I have at home and guess what I'm going to throw out today after work.

e: I don't have a baby thankfully but I use babypowder for shaving (helps prevent razor rash).
Corn starch is an awesome food source for all kinds of horrible stuff that can grow on people.
$29 million is literally a rounding error for this size of company. 

Don't get me wrong, I am happy they were penalized for something so poorly managed, but $29 mil for a $360+ billion dollar company... come on now.
I scrolled a mile deep just for this comment
I can understand getting drugs in that manner back alley cheese sounds pretty dairy-ng.
Why not? People buy cigarettes
You pick 12 random adults and a third of them won’t know the earth goes around the sun. I’d hate to be a defendant in a trial that required any level of intelligence.
Yes, as with all things, there's a chance. You can only study a finite number of people in any given study and so even if 50 studies come back inconclusive, there is still a miniscule chance that there is still an effect that is not being picked up by all that data.

There is a warning label on your talcum powder because some states (like California) require anything that even has the remote possibility to be a carcinogen to be labelled as such. Possible carcinogens include things like: Bacon, alcohol, coffee, pickles, cell phones, frying food, working as a hairdresser, etc. - there's not enough evidence to say that these things cause cancer or probably don't cause cancer but hey... it's possible.  


[Yoga pants contain the only known substance that 'probably' does not cause cancer](https://www.businessinsider.com/almost-everything-causes-cancer-2016-5?r=US&IR=T)
Big corporations lose cases all the time.  There’s an entire industry of class action lawyers that depend on it.

I’m sure Big Talc has a vault of human experimentation that went badly, though.

The ultimate cost to the company will be way larger. This is just the verdict for a bellwether case - Lawyers bring cases of various severity against the company in different jurisdictions across the country. Later these verdicts are used as a benchmark for settlements in those jurisdiction. So ultimately there will be many more similar cases in this jurisdiction that are settled with the payout relative to this verdict, and many more settled across the country relative to the talc cases in their jurisdiction.
Corn starch is cheap as dirt thanks to corn subsidies. The real reason is because they were afraid people would see the change as it becoming an inferior product and stop buying it.

Edit: a quick google check shows that corn starch is less than half the cost of talc by weight. That goes to show how powerful product familiararity is

On a side note, you can buy 50lbs of corn starch for 20 dollars. Miracle Grow is more expensive than that. *Literally* cheaper than dirt.
The new brand recognition is that Johnson and Johnson products gives your baby cancer. 
J&J had $1.3B in net income in 2017.

$29M is nothing to them. Thered have to be hundrends of these rules before it affects them
How much it's really worth, if they keep *killing* people.
Asbestos and a just a general term for the form certain minerals can take.  Legally, Talc is not considered asbestos, but geologically it is considered to have an asbestoform.  Basically, depending on how it forms talc can BE asbestos.


Normally they use what’s called “treasure talc” which forms plates and slides along, which is better for personal use.  Industrial use used to use the more gritty talc which had a higher asbestos content.   Note: ALL TALC contains traces of asbestoform minerals.

Source: sat on a very informative (but very long) civil trial about talc and was actually interested in the material.

Edit:  The trial was actually against a mining company for selling industrial talc they knew to cause cancer due to asbestoform talc.  They argued that it wasn’t legally asbestos, the geologists and medical professionals argued that  human body doesn’t care about legal definitions.
From the minds that brought you talc comes...asbetos!
Dear god.i used this very same product constantly. I had stage one ovarian cancer now it reappeared as stage three ovarian cancer years later. I haven’t had any female reproductive organs forever. Cells are now in the lymphnodes. I was a class action law suit. I will never see a dime. If favorable it will be in appeals court forever. Would be nice to leave child and his family a nice sum. Just had to have my damn talcum powder.
What in the ever living fuck!?!?! How the hell did it take people this long to figure out that's bad!?!?

"jee Wizz you mean it's not good to have powdered asbestos derivatives floating around in the air? Jee whoda thunk it."
Talc on itself is safe, unless cross contaminated with minerals that can cause cancel when mixed with the talc.  
Problem is that to make talc 100% safe, is relatively hard.
As someone who did removal for a few summers I can always tell if a old house has asbestos by the smell.
I usually chew on my brake pads and I can tell you...yum, yum, yum.
>Switching from asbestos to corn starch

You mean switching from **talc** to corn starch right?
I have no idea how to even get my records from my old doctor, but i wish i could get in on this seriously. It's just so overwhelming. I used it for years and i'm recently found to be stage one. I'm terrified. 
How do you detect ovarian cancer? I get my pap smear every two years, but I think that's for cancer in the uterus, so I have no idea.

I wish you all the best. I'm glad you've got a good doctor. Stay strong! 
Why hasn’t a judge combined them all into one class action lawsuit?  I thought that was standard practice when there are many individual suits on the same exact thing?
You know what else gets bigger and bigger? Their product portfolio. I'm willing to bet you probably have a great deal of JNJ products in your home at any given time, probably $100s of dollars worth at any given second. They are absolutely *massive*.
Perhaps, but they haven't paid a dime yet. My mother is one if the ones waiting (while she can) to see a successful suit. Flood gates will open once money is paid out. 
While you may be correct in a sense, I see it a little differently. 

The cost to someone injured by this is potentially death. For many people it has been. Basically, it cost them existing at all. 

The cost of these lawsuits, even if the numbers have gone up over the years, is not enough to cost the abuser, Johnson and Johnson, in a way that equals the impact on their victims. The company still exists, even with large payouts. The victims do not. 

So when you counter someone that this company has had to pay more over time, I can’t hear you over how intrinsically they ruined lives and murdered people for money, of which there is still enough of to keep. 

Those are not the rules of a society that values human life. 
I and probably most people on this thread are uneducated on this. The title doesn't say shit about this being a string of payments. 
Have they been paying an amount comperable to the profit they've made from providing this product to customers? I imagine that executives continued with this hazardous product because they anticipated making so much money that court losses wouldn't matter in comparison. 

I do hope that there is no end to these lawsuits, and they lose every penny five times over for what they have done. 
lol those judgments aren't shit if you have 340billion in your reserves, that's called "the cost of doing business".
I’ve only recently heard of this. How many lawsuits have there been?
Lol that’s one of the funnier malapropisms I’ve come across in a while 
I'm not sure what women (and men) should really use as corn starch is organic and feeds fungal bacteria such as ringworm.

I'm looking at my bottle of baby powder right now and it says "Ingredients: Talc, fragrance".

I bought it a couple weeks ago. 
The complete removal of talc is a recent change though, right? I could be misremembering, but I'm fairly certain I've bought talcum powder sometime within the last few years (I started using cornstarch after I started seeing these news stories). 
Maybe in America, but not Asia. 
Jesus I had to double check, that is in fact income. Revenue is so high it hurts my head. 
Up your *ASS* ?
I can't believe this honestly
Pardon me for being ignorant, but... Why do you have to inhale it? If a girl is using it to powder her genitals, couldn't some 'go up' and get absorbed in the same way that might happen if you inhale it?
I mean it's impossible be 100% sure that you'll never inhale it. Pretty sure everyone who has used baby powder has inhaled it to some extent.
Profit. Sales/revenue is almost $230m per day.
Just because there are big problems doesn’t mean we shouldn’t also stop comparatively smaller problems. If there’s an alternative to something that is easy, cheap and immediately removes all risk why do we bother continuing with the original? 
Don't.

The talc used here doesn't contain asbestos and hasn't for decades.

Cornstach, water and a warm, dark place can mean a lot of mould and bacterial problems.

A typical screen size is 20" or 0.5 meters. If you were to scroll a mile, you would need to scroll a distance of 1609 meters, which would mean you would need to scroll **3218 times** your screen size. 

The total vertical length in pixels of this page is 25140, and assuming a typical screen has 1600 pixels vertically, that means from top of the page to bottom, you can scroll 25140/1600 = **14 times** your screen size only. 

Hence, it's not possible to scroll a mile on this page as you would literally have to scroll 3204 times passed the page height, which is nonexistent. From the top of the page to this comment is about 6 times my screen size, so that means you scrolled 6\*0.5 m = **3 meters**. Not a mile, but a measly 3 meters. 
So just put warning labels on it that it causes cancer and we're good
It's a long term murder weapon!

 ^^pleasedon'tdothis
I was in California once. When I saw a warning label in an elevator that the elevator might cause me cancer I realized these warnings are garbage. Either fix the problem or don't. Don't put warning labels that are inconsequential. 
IANAL but I would assume as part of the contract for taking on the suit in the first place. 
The court has to approve the lawyer fee as part of a class action settlement or award to ensure that it is reasonable.
The lawyers contracts. They usually aren't paid hourly for these big cases. 
*Sigh*.

I hate **Big Talc**.
The real question in my mind is; what was the cost difference between the two when the decision was made.  I really wonder also what the science was telling these Execs back then.

Except you shouldn't use food starch to powder sweaty regions because it provides nourishment to the bacteria that cause the stink you're trying to avoid. Talc is a far superior functionally than corn or potato starch
The sad part is they could be killing the market on “All-natural product - made with American corn starch” and key in on the increase of the health minded  society 
Corn starch is an inferior product. 
Miracle grow has a bunch of shit in it. You can't say cheaper than dirt....
They've been spending a shitload of money on Facebook ads touting how their talc is "medical grade". It's hilarious how desperate they are.
just one among many class action suits, they are going on $5b in payouts so far, see details below. 

not saying even this is really gonna hurt, we are talking a huge conglomerate with like a $370b market cap. but for that kind of money on just one product, I imagine they already could have bought out the nearest competitor and used their scent, with change to spare
2018 they made $81.6 billion in sales across their brands
This is not correct. I'm a geologist, I'll explain properly...

[Talc](https://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?mineral=Talc) is a hydrated magnesium silicate, a [phyllosilicate](https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/phyllosilicates.htm) mineral structurally related to sheet silicates i.e. micas. It forms by the hydrothermal alteration of magnesium rich rocks. Talc itself only forms [microscopic plates](https://mvascientificconsultants.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Talc-Particle-Electron-Microscope-Image.jpg), never fibres. It is never asbestiform, which describes the physical shape of crystals, long thin and needle like, which poses a risk of inhalation and asbestosis.

However, talc maybe contaminated with [Tremolite](https://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?lang=en&language=english&mineral=Tremolite) and more rarely [Anthophyllite](https://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?lang=en&language=english&mineral=Anthophyllite) or [Serpentine](https://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?lang=en&language=english&mineral=Serpentine), structurally these are chain silicates, minerals that can have needle like [asbestiform](https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/health.usgs.gov/inhalation/asbestiform.html) properties if their crystals are particularly long and thin.

A proper safety analysis of talc not only involves a detailed mineralogical analysis, using [X-ray diffraction](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) (XRD) and a [Petrological Microscope](http://www.tetrapods.co.uk/sciencefacilities/laboratories/mpb/opticalOre.html), but a physical examination of the shape of the Tremolite or other mineral contaminants, if present. This typically involves using the Petrological microscope and a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to measure the size and aspect ratio (the thinness) of the crystals.

The mere presence of tremolite and other contaminants does not necessarily indicate that there is a risk, the risk depends on if the contaminating crystals are asbestiform, which pose a risk of lung cancer.

However, there is some scientific evidence that the mineral Talc is itself is carcinogenic, it has been linked to ovarian cancer.

Just wanted to say that I read and appreciate your comment! Informative! No idea that asbestos is a form minerals could take, and not just a material itself!
> industrial use used to use

Okay, that's just too damned many.
Everybody needs to google ‘talc pleurodesis’ it’s when we intentionally kill the lining of the lungs with talc (we squirt it in there) to keep fluid from building up. 
>They argued that it wasn’t legally asbestos, the geologists and medical professionals argued that  human body doesn’t care about legal definitions.

You're simplifying an entire court case to one sentence, so I'm sure a lot of relevant context is missing, but in general I have to agree with the mining company's argument.

Our entire legal system is based around the idea of rule of law. Laws exist, and you follow them or get punished. If you start punishing people because they "should have known that's what the law was going for", instead of the actual text of the law, you begin a really slippery slope of subjectivity. 
It worries me you were a juror on a talc trial and still dont understand the science behind this....

Asbestos is a great material to work with. Its flaw is unfortunate.
The buddy comedy I've always wanted... and could have had by buying Johnson's baby powder.
I’m really sorry for what you’re going through. 
Even if you pass away, can't you set it up where your family would receive the payment if the class action suit is eventually successful?
If it makes you feel any better, using that powder does not guarantee cancer, nor does avoiding all those stuff prevent it completely. Just look at smokers, not all of them get it. 
In the repeated refrain of our lives. Corporations lie and will put profits over people. 
What’s it smell like? I’ve probably been in enough old buildings, houses, etc, I just don’t know what I’m smelling.

Not sure about your exact situation but stage 1 is usually very treatable! Stay strong 
That's not for the judge to do
My guess is because class actions require commonality in causation and injury, which can be really hard to establish for a large amount of medical diagnoses. Too much variability in types of exposure, degree of exposure, symptoms, prognoses, etc. and a judge is going to be very hesitant about certifying a class. Also if no one files for certification the court won't consider it, but they might coordinate multiple cases.
What does that have to do with anything? The suggestion was that the fallout from this decision will not be great enough to have made them regret this decision from a business perspective which is completely ridiculous considering the volume of the judgements being made against them.
Maybe read the article then? First paragraph

>latest defeat for the healthcare conglomerate which is facing thousands of similar lawsuits
Classic reddit user reads the title and feels like they know enough to make a statement about the topic 
Though it does say “latest” implying there are previous ones. They could have more details in the article though.
Yeah, you need to read the article that the payment is just for one woman.
You're right, you'd have to follow current events in order to be aware of the fact that this was just the latest of a string of judgements against them.

Asbestos is dangerous to your lungs because it's unable to be 'digested', so it stays lodged in there forever. If that builds up over time, you've got serious issues.
Bill Clinton has never inhaled it
No. But it's kinda absurd to make all this fuzz over talc when it has a comparatively small risk of cancer. Especially compared with smoking.
source on that?
Someone in a thread above explained that all talc contains at least some asbestos, as the mineral can take an asbestos shape. Different grades contain different proportions of asbestosform talc. 
I usually don't like the kind of knee-jerk reactions you see a lot but I think throwing away some $3 or whatever it is baby powder to guard against asbestos is worth it lol. Especially considering the fluidity still of knowledge in this area and j&j's flexible morals when it comes to informing people of asbestos in their products.
The asbestos is a natural biproduct of talc mining.  I don't believe you can feasibly separate the two and entirely eliminate asbestos.  Talc will still contain some "trace amount" asbestos in it.  Unfortunately for asthetic and effeciency reasons jnj did not want to use other alternatives even. 

Source:check the original Bloomberg article and you'll see the internal docs going back a few decades ago
That's, um, extremely unlikely, due to the physical conditions under which it forms.
Bullshit, they knew for decades and did nothing.  You're either lying or misinformed.
Also, wasn't it only bad for women? Something about ovaries. 
And it's flammable
You're basically rubbing sugar on your nuts. Any bacteria or moulds that can break down starch are gonna have a field day if you get sweaty down there.

You know in movies when someone is crawling through a desert, and they see an oasis? That's like fungi and bacteria looking at your nuts. 
Corn starch is a lovely food for jock itch.

(Yes, Gold Bond is a lie.)
Your body already produces an immense amount of foodstuff for various harmful organisms without the corn starch, yet you probably have not had any issues yet.  Just shower thoroughly every day, sud and scrub your planes and creases, and you're gonna be fine.
or just call it a night. 






haaaah. 
It’s california, there are labels for cancer risk already on everything
That’s correct. It’s discussed in the fee agreement. 
They are paid as a percentage of the judgment. That's the point of class-action lawsuits. Most of the time they are large groups of normal people without the resources to hire lawyers so they group up and say "hey lawyers we have XYZ people who could be collectively owed $30 million. Take our case and work for free for a few years and if you win you get to keep $10 million of it."
It's easy to pull or change a product when it has an immediately observable danger to it. But in cases like this it takes years of exposure and it's very difficult to prove there is a connection. 

When it's difficult to prove and not immediately observable, the execs may choose to believe the science is inconclusive and nothing will ever come of it. Makes it much easier to dismiss. 
This here is the point. What were the medical conclusions of that time. Based on evidence it seems that there is not a connection between the talk and cancer. At that small amount. However , people get sick. Is it in the normal incidence ? Is it some coincidence? Or is it related to the powder? It’s hard to decise when the evidence is inconclusive. And it is inconclusive. The medical community says that it’s not  related.
Yeah, I was about to say that fertilizer is going to be significantly pricier than dirt, lol. 
“Gluten-free!”
I literally get an ad every other day about this, I've never even googled or put an online presence that i care about it even so it's not a targeted ad
i saw a Facebook ad that literally said they definitely never tested positive for asbestos. Everyone laugh reacted to it. like holy crap 😂
A medical grade carcinogen maybe.  
While i am happy to see such a relatively large number already (and the fact there are 1000s of suits apparently), i always remember the scene from Fight Club: if cost of litigation is less than costs of recall and fixing, dont fix it. I hope this stays as a large number of cases instead of 1 large class action so that it keeps popping up from time to time
Is market cap really the best measure of how many (potentially ongoing for decades) lawsuits they can weather?
Yeah but sales doesnt equal profit so its a little disingenuous to use that number. Sales shows how many people prefer their product, net revenue shows how well they run a business of those products. 

Data of sales, revenue and litigation for just baby powder would be interesting to see
Just want to add that when people consider the *has been linked to cancer* qualification, that the list of things that have been linked to cancer is extraordinarily long.  If that is the risk threshold you want to apply in life, most people have to make major changes in their lifestyle.  

Alcohol, processed meats, red meat, popcorn, etc, etc.  
The false comment gets 1000 upvotes and gilded.  The true comment barely noticed
Quick question - do you possibly know if is there a method in place to purify/clarify Talc to remove possible contamination of tremolite, anthophyllite or serpentine?

I work in pharma, so it's not unusual to purify your raw materials.  I was curious if a method exists and JNJ simply isn't using it, or there will always an inherent risk.
That study about talc itself causing cancer was rejected by the CDC and FDA as not credible due to a variety of experimental and logical flaws just FYI.
Yeah!  There are many minerals that can be Asbestiform.  The funniest named one is cummingtonite.  Not a joke, look it up.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummingtonite
I’m glad my attempt to share some cool information I learned wasn’t up to your standards of free internet content.  I will try to do better in the future.
He said it was a civil trial. Civil suits are meant to find if Party A will be held accountable for whatever Party B is blaming them for, not if they will be held accountable for breaking the law. That would be a criminal trial.
The United States is a common law system, in contrast to a civil law system. The difference being that in civil law counties, what's on the books is law, and no more, whereas common law systems are based on precedent, judgement based on merit and sprit of the law. 

Our legal system is designed and predicated around the premise of subjectivity. The spirit of the law is important, as evidenced by this case. You're fundamentally wrong by nature of the US and Anglosphere's unique system.
Yeah, that's true of a lot of products though that have turned out to be bad though. Many things that are convenient from the production end turn out to be bad in the long run when you consider human health or other impacts. It really does seem like a good idea for companies which provide products that regularly come into contact with humans to make sure those products are as likely to be safe as possible, to avoid these issues.
It is a real miracle material, if not for mesothelioma we would use that shit for basically everything 
TY but I will be OK my major source of pain is coming from a pinched nerve in lower back. Kind of you.

Why would that make *them* feel better?  *They* have cancer
It costs them less in fines and court losses than it does in profit. Removing all compassion and empathy, of course an entity would choose to make $20 million illegally and at risk to the public if the consequence is $750 000 taken. 
Also curious.
Smells like asbestos
You guys Gunna explain what it smells like?
Well that's a spot on bar exam answer!
Is this meant to sound so condescending?
Talc THAT has asbestos - meaning that not all talc has asbestos and that certain kinds of talc are safe.

Wooks come from all ages, creeds, locations... Have you ever met a southern wook? They're an interesting..flavor
Are wooks still a thing?
Talc is safe. These trials are based on bullshit and get thrown out on appeal all the time as soon as the appellate court looks at the information provided by the FDA and WHO who have both independently tested cosmetic talc powders back into the 1960s on a regular basis and have never found asbestos in them.
[deleted]
Incorrect. I looked it up back when this whole thing started. There are versions of talc that do not contain asbestos. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html

Key word, some. Not all, not even most from what I've found.
is it a certain % that is ok? and is that ok?
Ya asbestos is bad for only women
I (who originally posted about Penaten) am a woman so... 
Here you go, it’s not what most people think. 

https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-johnson-and-johnson-talc-cancer-case/
It's still early though
It’s absolutely incorrect in class cases. Contract may say one thing, but the judge gets the final say in class cases.

Edit: this is a tort, I worked in these cases and should have known. Jury awards this amount. There is a ratio rule between punitive and compensatory damages that often gets these verdicts appealed. The court can still overturn the amount.
I'm well aware, but this isn't a class action lawsuit, and the amount differs greatly from one law firm to the next. Not every lawsuit will be 30%. Depending on the size of the expected payout the firm might take 10% or might take 40%. This is all explicitly stated in the contracts the firm has with their clients. 
Even if they knew something may come of it the cost-benefit analysis was obviously in their favor.  Just like the Execs trying to figure out how to better sell cigs after the surgeon generals warning.  Im sure someone down the line was telling them it was bad but like other commenters have said they had to maintain a certain smell and consistency.  When science is new its just so much easier to ignore and like you said wait for an observable outcome, its better for the short term which investors will always, always love.
My 70 year old father is literally in the dying process at this moment from bladder cancer. He used baby powder everyday of his adult life to keep “things” dry, until being warned by his urologist about 2 years ago that they suspected it could cause cancer through introduction into the body by the urethra. Apparently breathing it in is also dangerous.
Yes and no. If they start losing that market cap will quickly evaporate. The cap IS a proxy for how much it is worth it to them to keep fighting, expensively if necessary. 
It's not. Market cap is just what investors who are buying and selling right now think the company is worth.
An important observation. The reason lawyers are going after the asbestos-talc angle is because asbestos is an established carcinogen, they don't have to prove that. However, asbestos contamination is so rare (<0.1%) and levels are so low, if they do occur, that that the health problems we seem to be seeing (ovarian cancer in women) are unlikely to be due to asbestos. It seems to be the talc itself.

But no lawyer worth his salt will try to win a case claiming talc caused women's ovarian cancer, when an established carcinogen can be conveniently used as a scapegoat.

It is ironic that current legal actions against companies over asbestos in talc may not result in an melioration of risk posed by pure talc. Companies can avoid asbestos and keep selling talc.
Very common on reddit.  R/legaladvice at your own peril... used to be a great place, but mods want a popular sub not a curated one.
Because you know, sitting a jury means you know the science...
No, it is not possible to remove the contamination. However, contamination with tremolite, anthophyllite or serpentine, according to Pierce et al. 2017 was very rare, with less than 0.1% of talc samples in the US contained small traces these minerals and furthermore none of the crystals were asbestiform. They said this also applied historic talc samples, before they started monitoring and avoiding contaminated talc.

>Nonetheless, even if some historical cosmetic talcum products contained trace amounts (0.1%) of asbestiform minerals, any resulting asbestos exposure would be expected to be exceedingly low, and comparable to expo-sures from breathing ambient air.

That said, I remember a student in my geology department around 2000-2002 did her project on talc and found about a 1/3rd of samples contained detectable levels of tremolite. This was in Europe and before the talc scare.

It is important to remember that the asbestos scare is a Red Herring, the levels are too small to pose a risk. On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence that pure talc itself is harmful.
Cummingtonite was named after the town of Cummington, Massachusetts, where it was discovered in 1824. It is also found in Sweden, South Africa, Scotland, and New Zealand

I wouldn't trust a fucking word from Johnson and Johnsons website, or their products. 
If J&J imports any talc for its powder from China, you can bet the bank that it's cut with other minerals/ingredients.  I mean, China industry did that with infant formula and dog food, right? 
Can someone just tell me what's safe to rub on my nutsack already?
“Talc that has asbestos is generally accepted as being able to cause cancer if it is inhaled. The evidence about asbestos-free talc is less clear.”

>Asbestos and a just a general term for the form certain minerals can take. Legally, Talc is not considered asbestos, but geologically it is considered to have an asbestoform. Basically, depending on how it forms talc can BE asbestos.

>Normally they use what’s called “treasure talc” which forms plates and slides along, which is better for personal use. Industrial use used to use the more gritty talc which had a higher asbestos content. Note: ALL TALC contains traces of asbestoform minerals.

It naturally occurs alongside talc. It’d be impossible to have no contamination at all 
Why take the chance? 
> Anti Monkey butt power

If I remember right, it's not even asbestos that can harm ovaries necessarily.  It's that talc is a mineral that doesn't dissolve in water and there's a chance microscopic bits can make their way up the vagina and end up stuck in ovarian tubes that have no mechanism to clean them out.  Then your body deals with it horribly (tumors and cysts) and you can get cancerous mutations.
Amen, great point. Would also add that there is rather damning evidence from internal memos back in the early 1970s before testing was in-place and when the risk from asbestos were becoming better understood.  Those materials certainly don't put J&J in a good light, but even then these are the types of things that can seem far more insidious with the benefit of hindsight.  

I haven't followed recent cases closely, but the ones I've looked at in the past feel a bit tenuous.  Reminds me of the bad/incorrect 'science' of cancer risk from breast implants that brought down DOW.
9 out of 10 comments there involve, "I'm not a lawyer but here's my opinion anyway"
It's amazing we rely  on trial by  jury at all
Does it need to be inhaled to be harmful or is skin contact enough? 
I see

*narrows eyes*
Only *heard* of it, eh?
Depends on who you’re rooting for.  We sided against the mining company... there was just too much evidence that they knew and tried to cover it up.  After the trial, the judge even told us there was a mountain of other evidence the company’s lawyers had been able to keep from making it into court.
You're looking at it from the wrong angle, the benefit of the system is in these judgement calls. Rather than require massive, explicit codes that state every action you can take AND every action you cannot, you allow for judgement calls, and let those calls establish precedent. 

Laws exist for a reason, and if the reason isn't clear or the scope of the law didn't consider circumstances then the system affords judges AND your peers in a jury the chance to remedy that. 

In this case, the law was obviously made to protect people from being exposed to a dangerous substance. That one definition of the term they used to describe the substance was questionable doesn't override the fact the company willingly exposed people to danger. The company can't hide behind the loophole if they did act with negligence, and if it was a legitimate surprise to them then the judgement could have even gone in their favor.

If you don't like the way that works, look into the benefit and downsides of a civil system versus a common law system. There's no clear better option, you may just be more partial to that system. But that's not what's used in America. 
Is this in US? Because in Europe they have been banned for a long time. 
Not anymore; the use of asbestos in the US is very limited.

The article goes on to say that some studies have shown a modest increase in perineal (genital) cancers. Kind of a weird article to hold up as proof of talc being totally safe. 
That actually sounds like an interesting trial. Who won? What was the judgement? 
Yes, and people upvote based on the conclusion they want to hear, not based on the quality of advice.  I eventually got banned for taking people to account on sourcing unqualified advice or retracting their comment after i provided sources showing they were giving terrible advice (formerly an attorney)... i can't imagine many people with actual knowledge can put up with participating in that sub anymore.  Used to be great tho before it got popular.
No, it does not need to be inhaled

That said, an inhalation risk is more of a concern for talc miners and talc mill workers e.g. ‘talc  pneumoconiosis’, where levels of talc dust exposure is very high. There isn't much evidence of lung disease caused by talc at lower levels, amongst people who use it cosmetically.

However, there is evidence that talc particles might cause ovarian cancer in women, who use talc for "perineal  hygiene". Talc particle can travel all the way to the fallopian tubes in about 30 minutes and talc particles have been found inside ovarian tumours.

Its mechanism of toxicity, as is the case with asbestos, is poorly understood. Cancer maybe caused by physical scaring of cells and tissue, talc particles provoking inflammation or the generation of DNA damaging free radicals on the mineral surface that damages nearby cells.

Yeah. I did find it informative and wouldn’t have thought to check the ACA so I’m happy he linked it. 
You should reply to the comment that I linked.

I'm just passing on the message.
Yes and no. Jurors are just average people and there are a lot of legal norms that they are not aware of but which exist for good reason. Given that plus the fact that even trained minds are easily biased by certain kinds of information, it is important that there are limits on the evidence that the jury is presented. But it’s definitely frustrating when legal wrangling prevents important evidence from being presented at trial.
It's hard to know what's right in that kind of situation. Usually, if evidence gets dismissed, it's for a reason most people would agree with if the defendant were who they were rooting for.

It sucks that shady individuals use these tactics to avoid responsibility, but you do genuinely want those protections in place for the innocent defendants.
I think it's still technically legal, but for liability reasons it largely disappeared in all friction material by 2000 or so. 
Note, this isnt a real appeal. Circuit courts in Missouri are trial courts, and burlison is the judge who presided over the underlying trial. This is really just a procedural step to get before the appellate court.
This is random but the documentary 'Born Rich' was done by one of the heirs to the J&J money. 
That was a desperate play, they are liable for a lot if these charges are true. I had it used on me as a child too God knows how many have been exposed to asbestos. 
That must really chafe the J&J executives. Too bad they don't have a safe product to treat that.
For reference, their net income in 2017 was $1.3 billion and their revenue in 2017 was $76.45 billion.
I don't think people really understand this court case. This all came out before the leaked records discussed asbestos being found in the talcum powder. That is, all of the scientific searches failed to find any significant increase in mesothelioma cases from talcum powder use. If this ruling went through as it was, then scientific basis no longer matters for suing people. Court cases would pop up everywhere suing companies for GMOs, and whatever other batshit thing because somebody actually won a court case with no evidence to back them up.

Obviously the leaked files changes things. The talcum powder studied in those scientific studies could have been free from asbestos, while some of the sold product would contain it, and that makes a big difference. But this has all come after the fact and this ruling will be a giant mess. 

All of that sad, if the asbestos contamination rate caused increased cancer rates then that fine needs to be vastly increased and expanded to cover all victims.
4.7 billion seems like a bit much for 22 people when there are probably 10000+ people who suffered exactly the same. Shouldn't everyone affected get a similar payout?
So, is this stuff safe to use now? Just curious. 
Talc is a primary ingredient in many cosmetics. What does this mean for the cosmetics industry?

They finally found out that J&J grinds babies intos powder and sells them. Monsters
Remember that there is no science to say that J&J Baby Powder causes cancer.

Science has a very tough set of requirements. And governments, and civil cases, and even criminal cases, don't have to meet such a burden as science requires.

A government can claim whatever it wants, and it doesn't have to be backed up by science: 

- government can claim that pesticides are causing colony collapse disorder. Science disagrees; but governments aren't scientists, and aren't bound by the dictates of science
- it's like the Monsanto cancer case: a jury decided that RoundUp causes cancer when there is no science to back it up

There's a descending order of difficulty:

- **Science** (must survive the most rigorous standards of scrutiny)
- **Criminal case** (beyond a reasonable doubt)
- **Civil case** (More likely than not - a preponderance of the evidence)

**Bonus**: [Carl Segan, Cosmos Part 4 - Heaven and Hell, standard of science](https://youtu.be/y9WItoTOiyM?t=1785)

In the case of governments, and in civil cases, it is perfectly acceptable when answering the question:

- Does this pesticide cause cancer?
- Does this baby powder cause cancer?
- Is this certain pesticides or GMO killing off bees?

to answer:

> "I'm not sure, but I think so"

And i'm not being facetious; that really is what it is. 

- a government can claim whatever it wants, and ban whatever it wants, but it doesn't have to follow science
- civil lawsuits also don't follow the rules of science 
- science is rigorous, and doesn't care about politics or shifting passions of people

**tl;dr:** GMOs don't kill bees, pesticides do not cause CCD. And Johnson&Johnson baby powder does not cause cancer.
There’s so much misinformation related to this case. Someone else posted already, but both J&J and third party groups have never found asbestos in baby powder. The memos also don’t confirm the presence of asbestos; rather, the memos state that they should be cautious and conduct additional tests...which they did do at that time.

Strongly recommend you check out their site regarding this case. If this case isn’t overturned or appealed in favor of J&J, we’re implying that facts don’t matter any more, which only serves to weaken our justice system.

Will someone tell me if the powder still gives you cancer or can I continue using it on my balls?
Curious how this all turns out. My mom is diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer, and used J&J Baby Power excessively in her younger years. Fortunately she's been fighting for the last year, unfortunately, unless some new treatment comes along, she's not winning the fight. 
Anyone know if fines or payouts are tax deductible? 
I’ve been putting asbestus on my dick for years. Now it’s fire proof. Thanks Johnson and Johnson. 
In the early seventies studying environmental health talc was already  linked to cancer. Its use with rice in Japan to reduce clumping produced unusually high rates of stomach  cancer.  Many people were suggesting use of cornstarch or other powders to avoid risks that talc might be carcinogenic.  US rules required significant evidence of harm  before ingredients could be restricted.  Injured party had to prove harm rather than company having to prove products are safe when there is suspicion of danger  
The science if read properly doesn't even support the talc and gynae cancer link. Does this?
The astroturfing is real here. Whole chains of comments patting each other on the back with dozens of upvotes all culminating in "j&j did nothing wrong and this whole thing is fictitious"
Isn't news like this the stuff that feeds conspiracies?

They knew for decades.
My mother was 25 when she got ovarian cancer in 1984. Declared terminal, total hysterectomy, chemo, radiation, managed to beat it and is in remission for 34 years now. 

She used to talc her vulva with J&J powder like many others then. I wonder if she has a case...?
They better have tested these women's relatives to see if there's a history of ovarian cancer to begin with.  I don't see how a judge/jury could be so stupid to award each plaintiff 213.6 million dollars when people that are brutally murdered can't receive half as much.

&#x200B;

If this results in J&J getting government bailout, I'm going to teach myself French and move to Canada.

My ex works for this judge...this was a huge case
> Documents used in the case and reported last week by The New York Times and Reuters revealed that Johnson & Johnson has known for decades about the risk of asbestos contamination in its talc, but fought to keep negative information behind closed doors.

Okay, but will anyone actually go to jail over this?
Can anyone give me an Out of the loop on this?
I feel like this case will be appealed to the Supreme Court for that punitive damage amount alone: it’s a 1:8 ratio of compensatory to punitive damage amount. While 1:9 is the absolute limit of how much of a discrepancy can go, anything over 1:4 or 1:5 often get ruled unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. This Circuit court judge seems to want to test that by awarding damages in this ratio though. 
They seem to have poured just as much money into advertising lately. I forgot that there was a lawsuit until baby powder is super safe ads were everywhere. 
This will be lucrative for some law firms, some plaintiffs, and probably won't change the relevant cancer stats at all.

It'll be just like the breast implant class action lawsuits. https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/silicone-breast-implant-litigation/2010-05
I remember when they sued the Red Cross for the red Cross logo.
So I should stop using this on my balls?
The American system of justice is seriously broken.
Talc and asbestos can often be found near one another. Some talc deposits may become 'contaminated' with asbestos. So instead of abandoning the mines they diluted it with talc from another source, making it appear acceptable in X ray diffraction. I believe a company would do this to save money. The dangerous mentality of, 'its only a crime if I get caught.'

SOO what are we supposed to use now instead of baby powder?

It was always an unsafe product and they knew of it for generations before it became public knowledge.
Another loss for science celebrated as a win by the ignorant.
Good fuck them.  When does someone go to jail now for knowing about it and doing nothing?
This is not going to make it in the next level appellate court. The plantifs lawyer is begging for a settlement. J&J has a mountain of science and modern studies that says the baby powder is safe. This is a frivolous lawsuit against deep pockets because, why not.  J&J is one of the most conservative classy organizations in the US. There is no way they are hiding anything it’s not with it, you would just need to flip one person that used to work there, come on people don’t buy into this garbage. 
The wild thing is; the science is solidly in J&Js favour 
This will be buried, but I used to work for a health benefits company that dealt with FSA’s and COBRA. We were a medium sized company, but we saw millions of receipts from name brand stores.

J&J gave us a shit ton of new computers, servers, monitors, phone and IT equipment when the CEO’s kids make copies of the store reciepts, attached them to eligibility files of the participant, and sent them to J&J.

This was like 2009-ish. It was really awkward because I worked in an area of the data department where I saw the usernames of the CEO’s kids log into clients, what they were doing, what lead sheets they were deleting, and later being told to delete their entries (company policy was to ALWAYS leave a note when you entered into a participants account).

Again, a medium-ish company of like 90 employees.. but it was sketchy as fuck and I was bullied to not say anything.

Hello, WageWorks, then Creative Benefits :)
Does anyone realize how much money this is?  It's insane.  I don't care if they are guilty, no one human life worth that much cash...lets of real.  4.7B could buy out many companies lol.  
I feel like I'm being reasonable when I say "Fuck em."

I used those very measured words when balancing the fact that they knew about added carcinogens in their baby care products for over five decades and the only actions they took were ones meant to make themselves harder to catch.
Thank you.  There are still at least two appellate steps left in this process (Missouri Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court).  The case is also large enough that it might attract the attention of the U.S. Supreme Court (possibly on the issue as to whether the punitive damages are so excessive as to violate due process...yes, that's an issue [SCOTUS has previously expressed interest in](https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/constitution/b/constitutional-civil-rights/posts/punitive-damages-over-10-1-violates-due-process)), thereby resulting in a possible third level of appeal.

In short, the case has a long ways to go before the judgement become final and unappealable.
I upvoted because it sounds like you know what you’re talking about, but to be honest, I have no idea what you mean.

Why the hell don’t they just have straightforward numbering and naming for court proceedings?   Why is it appellate, chancery, JP, common pleas, etc etc etc.

If J&J talc truly contained asbestos sufficient to cause disease, why hasn’t a significant percentage of the population ended up with mesothelioma? We’re talking about a giant percentage of the population using these talc products.

Every single person to have been around an automobile with brake pads from before the 1960s, every single person to have lived on the Earth, every single person to have lived in any building built between the early 1800s and the late 1900s, every person to have ever gone in or near caves or mines, etc.

Even if the baby powder contained asbestos, no test ever showed that it was higher than the

1. Allowable amounts by even modern standards

2. Higher than the background contamination level (i.e. air born at street level) in cities of the day
> God knows how many have been exposed to asbestos.

Every baby was exposed, me included.  This isn't limited to talc though.  This opens up a much larger can of worms that we're not considering.  Asbestos is a very abundant mineral, and pretty much every consumer product that we dig out of the ground is in the same boat as talc.  Some may have much higher or lower concentrations, but it's likely (almost certain?) they're all contaminated to some degree.  
I dont think it's a desperate play. Even if the underlying claim is meritorious, I think J&J has a good argument that punitives should be reduced to 5x compensatory. 

This particular bid wasnt disparate either. It was a necessary procedural step to get before an appellate court.
think of all the parents exposed to it too. 
Now they're trying to cover their ass... since they've already covered mine in asbestos.

But God knows how much they're dumping in offshore banking schemes. Do you honestly believe their profit margin is little more than 1%? They knowingly exposed infants to asbestos for Christ's sake! Do you really expect they... Of all people are gonna be honest about their finances when offshore banking schemes are perfectly legal? 
That’s just because of the tax act. 2016 was about 16 billion
There was no plausible mechanism of action for external use causing ovarian cancer, the increased risk was withing statistical noise, and the plaintiff was exposed to plenty of asbestos elsewhere. Bad science, bad ruling, IDGAF about megacorporation profits but taking safe products off the market is not good for public health. Just like I couldn't care less about big ag companies, but glyphosate is probably the safest commercial pesticide (herbicides are a subcategory of pesticides in agriculture) out there and GMO foods like Golden Rice have the potential to help huge numbers of people.
I have a similar understanding.  This is similar to the glyphosate and breast implant cases where the science does not really back up the result. All of the evidence is pretty tediously tied and I don't think most scientists would say to stop using the product. The people at risk seem to be the miners.  But I have not read enough to say any of that with authority.
I'm actually not sure what is the exact lawsuit is anyway. They went to great lengths to reduce the asbestos in the product to the point where it was almost undetectable. Sure it was still in it and *can* cause cancer. So do food dyes, preservatives, sugars etc.


If they have to state their micro amounts of asbestos (as a result of mining) causes cancer, shouldn't Doritos also put that the red dye is a known carcinogen on their bags too?
> and that makes a big difference

Does it?  Asbestos isn't really all that dangerous - you need to breath in quite a bit of it over years to actually increase your odds of getting cancer.  I'm not aware that rubbing it on you has any impact.  And we're still talking trace amounts - asbestos in trace amounts is all over as it is naturally occurring.  I think the science will eventually say this is a non-issue, but only time will tell.  I wish the science could play out before the courts and juries start making verdicts.
Law schools need to start teaching the philosophy of science, fuck.
The important fact is that the apparent asbestos contamination doesn’t change the epidemiological studies that found absolutely zero link between the product and cancer.

So all the leaked emails show is that actually, there was no reason for anyone to be worried because topical applications of talc and tiny amounts of asbestos are clearly and provably not carcinogenic.

Such a travesty of justice and science that this happened at all
It was one lawsuit. There will be many more. Other people can bring suits as they get sick, but you can’t give a 1 size fits all damages when you don’t know when or how many or how sick people will get. 
The damages are that high to punish J & J. They knew it had asbestos and allowed people to continue to use it on their children. These damages tell them that they deserve to feel the pain that comes from putting profits over people so they never do it again. They deserve this and much more.
Use corn starch based powder instead of talc based.

I rarely use either, so I'm not sure if they act the same, but corn starch seems fine to me when I need it.

Plus as a bonus you can use the unscented kind from your kitchen if you don't want a sent.
IIRC any talcum based powder has a slight chance of causing ovarian cancer because talcum tends to come from the same source as asbestos so there could be some cross contamination if it doesn't get filtered out all the way. For men this is not an issue, for women, stick to cornstarch based products. 
inquiring balls want to know
Our legal system is just like our political system; bought and paid for a long time ago.
4.7 Billion is enough to make anyone feel it.  Much worse than a slab on the wrist.
It should be more, but taking away over 1/4 of a company's net profit in any given year is a much bigger blow than you are giving it credit for.
Make Guillotines Great Again
> tl;dr: GMOs don't kill bees, pesticides do not cause CCD. And Johnson&Johnson baby powder does not cause cancer.

You also forgot the other statements from the same think tanks: Lead in gas is not harmful to humans and lead is naturally in the environment, smoking does not cause cancer, coal plant emissions are not linked to human health, there's no proof that humans are linked to climate change. /s 
This. This is the only reasonable comment here. It looks like J&J never surpassed their quality control threshold (I believe <.003 Wt%) for asbestos. 

The media seems to be eating up and mixing the following two cases: whether talc is a carcinogen and whether JNJ has asbestos in their talc. JNJ and the FDA have hard data that prove without a doubt that both these things are false. People are eating this story up because it’s such a large and reliable company. I think this all this drama is coming down to cherry picking and confused facts. 

People are trying to boycott JNJ talc but they don’t seem to realize how many other products use the same talc that JNJ uses (but with fewer quality control checks). This includes various foods, products like gold bond, and MOST makeup products. All pressed powers use talc and there is no asbestos checks with these products (I work in this industry). Good on J&J for having all these quality and safety checks. You guys are all being exposed to a lot more talc via other means that isn’t being checked. Odds are J&J’s talc is more pure than any other the other talc we come into contact with every day. 
Why is this the only comment that talks about how there is no proof of asbestos?
Become a lawyer. Make 30% on commission. 
I had testicular cancer and one of my first questions to my Drs was that question since I've used it almost every day for the last 15 years. 

They assured my that there was no scientific data that connects the two as the powder will have no contact with the actual testicle.
You can use it. There is no link between talc usage and testicular cancer, or ovarian cancer, but that's less important for you.

More studies will be required, just don't use it internally or breathe it in for a laugh.
If your buying baby powder, take a look at it.  I bet it's corn starch.
Asbestos and talc are similar and can be found together in geologic deposits. The big health risk, in my mind, is via inhalation. I'm a conservative person when it comes to this kind of stuff, so I stopped using any talc products for now because I didn't feel assured that the product(s) I was using could guarantee that they didn't contain asbestos. There are additional on-going class action lawsuits for purported talc product linked mesothelioma cases. Mesothelioma in the lungs has historically been linked to asbestos exposure via inhalation.
Just want to say I am very sorry to hear about your mom. I hope she can find some treatment that works long term.
Fines or penalties are never tax deductible in the US
Talc is mined from the same geologic formations that contain asbestos. Everyone knows this. 
 
People sued because asbestos is bad. 
 
J&J and numerous other parties are unable to find a link between baby powder and risk of cancer. 
 
Judge says “science is irrelevant pay $5b.”

[Great article on it here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/baby-powder-asbestos-johnson-johnson.html)

TLDR; J&J covered up asbestos found in samples. Asbestos being linked to cancer is a known risk. 
It was found that J&J knew and did nothing about asbestos being an in their baby powder products. They got sued and this was their appeal to overturn the verdict of being found guilty in the lawsuit. 
Without those law firms nothing would change and J&J wouldn’t have any incentive not to do this shit again.  
Honestly? Nah. The cancer risk, if it exists in that scale would mainly apply to ovarian cancer and not via skin contact. So unless you literally cover your balls in it then dunk your testicles into your SOs vagina or have her inhale the still loose powder over a period of months or years, you're in the clear.
Ok but the flip side says that if it can pass a standardized x-ray test, is it even dangerous?

IIRC, there is a big jurisdictional issue with this case because of the Bristol-Myers-Squibb decision. For many plaintiffs, the only connection the case had to St. Louis/Missouri was that some of the labels used on the bottles came from a printer in Earth City, MO. BMS essentially already says the MO court likely is lacking proper jurisdiction, but it's still somewhat debatable. If SCOTUS ever takes a look at this, it might be for jurisdictional issues rather than for the punitive damages problem, but it could discuss both.

I also think the appellate courts in Missouri have already reversed a number of rulings on talc coming out of St. Louis/St. Louis County (and even this same judge) on jurisdictional grounds, so I doubt J&J is ever going to have to pay the $4.5B. It'll be interesting to see how this pans out with the whole change in public perception of J&J over the last few weeks.
I fail to understand how a 10:1 punitive damages award violates due process. Could you explain like I was 5?
> SCOTUS has previously expressed interest in),

And they don't even bring up Exxon-Valdez, aren't they a prime example of that sort of thing?
The currently award punitive damages to compensatory damages are only a 7.5 to 1 ratio. SCOTUS in State Farm v Campbell didn’t give a clear give clear guidance as to an appropriate ratio, but hinted that anything in the single digits would be within the bounds of due process. 
>Why the hell don’t they just have straightforward numbering and naming for court proceedings?

Court are different in different states.  In NY, the court of appeals is highest court, and the Supreme Court is a trial court.  That is the opposite of most states.  So unless you know each state's naming conventions, you are going to be confused.  

Adding to that, this article is about the denial of a motion in the trial court, but the name of the motion is not recited. It was most likely a motion for a judgment as a matter of law, but it is not stated in the article.  

Confusing naming conventions and bad articles combine for a confused public.
I’m probably just salty, but I think the law is complicated to make it only accessible to an elite class of people with the resources to study it. That might not be the purpose but that’s functionally the system we have, and I know of no effort to change it by the people it rewards.
I found it interesting how that one kid sued the J&J kid to try to prevent the doc from being released and then showed up at the release party like it was no big deal. Like these extremely rich people just have teams of minions protecting their interests and they just go on with their lives somewhat oblivious to all of it. 
That's pretty common among people that have literally no challenges in life.
I went to college with the Hornblower kid.  He was pretty nice and low key.  The rest were awful.
There was one kid that was actually pretty grounded and pitiable. I think it was the Vanderbilt kid, but I don't remember. It was the one who grew up being told he was poor and his uncle took him around the city and pointed to all the buildings they owned and told a little kid that they belonged to him. Pretty fucked up. But he seemed decently ok if I recall correctly.

In just society everything over something like 5mil should be taxed 100% after death. That's enough money for your children to have great life, they don't need the rest. People go on and on about greatness of markets and capitalism but forget that great man entrepreneurs get replaced by shitty spoiled brats who only care about money and will hire a CEO that will screw the workers and customers just to give them more return. Instead we should invest that money into educating the next generation that will do even more great things than the previous one.

Then again, you would run the society that way if humanity had goal of reaching stars and discovering vast galaxy that we live in, if your goal is instead fucked up aristocracy and rich worship then you have a perfect system already.

My parent's bought the house I grew up in from one of the people from this family.  The son had lived in the house and apparently threw lots of big parties where it wasn't uncommon to have strangers walking television sets out of the party down the street.

yep and they knew about it for decades and still did nothing.... tbh I don't see how they could not have known all along and when I say they knew about it for decades that came straight from a headline last week about J&J using asbestos in their baby powder.
So that's why I've never been able to light my farts on fire
If you think getting mesothelioma from breathing it in was bad....
No. I called to potentially join the class action suit. It has a very narrow coverage for women who have or died from ovarian cancer and used baby powder. For years women would put baby powder in their underwear to keep dry and nicely scented. The particles of whatever cancer causing agent would travel all up in the reproductive system. Logic tells me that powder could be responsible for all kinds of feminine cancers. But the only one they've been able to "prove" (not sure in which studies) is ovarian because the substance would get trapped up in there and not have a way back out. From the uterus or cervix, there was an "exit" for the particles to leave. Thus they can't "prove" that endometrial or cervical cancer was caused by the powder. 

My mother did this for years and died of endometrial cancer. We have one report that said ovarian origin can't be ruled out but she was never treated for ovarian, always endometrial. So I couldn't get our family involved in the class action against J&J.
No, talc contained something else which itself might have contained asbestos.
Not asbestos per se, but chemical compound with very similar structure and quite possibly similar side effects. 
Commenting and not reading the article lol never change reddit
That’s not what this lawsuit was about, but yes, that’s also true. J&J is in major trouble over their baby powder. 
Fireproofing for that spicy baby food. 
They are really looking into how much of the ovarian cancer rate (especially in older women) can be linked to baby powder. I think they may eventually find out other reproductive cancers are linked, too.

I’m an accountant (and working on an MBA). Parent companies must consolidate their financial statements with all of the subsidiaries they have control over (lower control levels require different reporting, but it’s still covered). These sized firms get audited every year by a Big 4 accounting firm to make sure their financials are fairly represented. I’m not saying things can’t slip, but it’s very likely J&Js financials were fairly represented in all material respects (that info is publicly available).  

It’s kinda a myth, or at the very least heavily misunderstood, that companies can hide large amounts of anything. Sarbanes Oxley changed the game when Enron happened.

Right. Of course they deserve it. My point is that you can't give every victim 200 million dollars, because there are too many victims, and J&J doesn't have enough money to pay out at that rate. J & J will be no more before everyone gets paid out.

200 million dollars is basically saying that each person that was killed prematurely because of them, their children, grand children, great grand children, and great great grand children never need to work a day in their lives because of what happened.
Dont use cornstarch if you have a fungal infection. Cornstarch sucksif you have anything breeding down there. Honestly they need to just find a way to make lab created talc. Talc is way better than cornstarch. Cancers a downer though.
So asbestos only causes ovarian cancer? It’s totally safe for men? You sure about that... I was also under the impression this was cost cutting not a inherent danger in manufacturing talcum
**Disclaimer: there is no science to back up these claims.**
No need for filtration when the mines that the talcum is taken from sample negative for asbestos, which they did.
What about cervical or uterine cancer. They seem more likely than ovarian.
I dunno, depends on what it's a slab of
It's a fraction of one years profit.
I agree but I think knowingly marketing asbestos to babies probably should be some sort of exception here in terms of what makes sense as a punishment
it should be way more.  the execs who were in charge and knew during the duration of time it was used should all be jailed and the company should be stripped down to nothing.  we're not seeing it quite yet, but think about how many millions of cases of cancer these fucks have potentially caused.  quarter profits of a single year?  we should be dragging them into the streets.

The lead controversy passed falsifiability, so did cancer for cigs, the others did not.

>You also forgot the other statements from the same think tanks: Lead in gas is not harmful to humans and lead is naturally in the environment, smoking does not cause cancer, coal plant emissions are not linked to human health, there's no proof that humans are linked to climate change. /s 

You are, either intentionally or accidentally, confusing science with not.

- every surgeon general since 1964 has warned of the dangers of smoking
- and since 1967, through Congressional mandate, a pack of cigarettes has been required to carry a warning label
- this from health effects that were already known at the turn of the 20th century

So when someone denies science, such as cigarette smoke is not harmful, it makes him look like an idiot.

- asbestos causes cancer
- your drinking water contains asbestos
- your drinking water does not cause cancer

Because of the levels we are talking about.

and even if you forget the levels were talking about: science is immune from the hysteria of stupid people. Science doesn't care about politicians. Science doesn't care about what a woman thinks. Science doesn't care what a court rules. Science doesn't care what he jury decides.

Do the levels of asbestos found in talcum powder cause cancer?

- we start from the null hypothesis
- and only reject it once there is evidence

Science doesn't care about big corporations. c.f. [this idiot](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/a7p1nz/johnson_johnson_loses_bid_to_overturn_a_47/ec5mqnv) who wants to use his irrational hatred of corporations as evidence. 
> Why is this the only comment that talks about how there is no proof of asbestos?

From a brand new account, that has almost no karma, posting J&J marketing stuff, [that's provably wrong - not only that asbestos was discovered, that J&J tried to cover it up, and killed the funding for the grad student studying it so he had to drop out?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/baby-powder-asbestos-johnson-johnson.html) Yeah - why is this the only comment... 
This is the correct take
J&j knew there was a chance it was there. Not that it was. Tests and studies done showed that there was no link between talc powder causing cancer, and that the talcum used in these instances did not have asbestos in it, nor have the mines used in the last 15 years sampled positive for asbestos. There is no science supporting these claims that talcum powder is bad for you. 
And it's the wrong family.  You're thinking of SC Johnson, which was founded by people unrelated to the Johnson and Johnson company.
Sorry I was writing this in a haste.

J&J contacted a company I used to work for, which dealt in Flexible Spending Accounts for medical expenses. Participants would send in receipts/invoices ect. to be reimbursed for their medical expenses.

I can spend a couple paragraphs explaining how medical FSA’s used to work, but essentially, you would say “take out X amount out of my income every pay check, tax free, then reimburse me for all the medical/dental expenses I incur throughout the year.”

SO. The company I worked for had millions of scanned copies of reciepts/invoices.. and J&J wanted those reciepts, along with the personal data associated with the participant. 

So let’s say you go to Wal-Mart and buy your RX, along with other items.. the company I worked for would get that receipt in a claim to authorize a reimbursement.. but we would also have the entire receipt, along with a catalog of information about you and your family.

J&J made a deal with our company to get those reciepts, along with the participant’s data, in exchange for non-cash items like used monitors, computers and servers.

Sorry, rereading my last post I realized it’s a confusing story to even break down in a tl/dr


Tl/dr.. J&J paid a company I used to work for in non cash items for personal information, so I’m not surprised reading that they are scummy.
The top three owners of Johnson and Johnson stock are middle class retirement funds. 
Was the plaintiff from St. Louis or a user of the product in St. Louis?  Because if either of those are true, it would seem to remove the case from the Bristol decision.  The Keeton decision referenced in Bristol allows assertion of specific jurisdiction to those injured by use of a product in the forum state.  And the court also stated the following, which should allow her to sue in Missouri if she is a MO resident:

>Alternatively,  the  plaintiffs  who are  residents  of  a  particular  State—for  example,  the  92 plaintiffs  from  Texas  and  the  71  from  Ohio—could  probably  sue  together  in  their  home  States. 

In any event, I agree with you that this would definitely be something the Supreme Court might want to take up on the personal jurisdictional issues as well.

The case this comes from, State Farm v Campbell, had an issue of punitive damages far more than 10x what the judgement was for. The SCOTUS knew this was an issue and they had to draw the line *somewhere*. They chose 10:1 because it seemed reasonable. Also, they did not say this strictly is against the rules, just that it would make them raise an eyebrow. 
It makes corporations and the rich have to actually think about consequences.
>  In NY, the court of appeals is highest court, and the Supreme Court is a trial court.

FYI, this is the NY Supreme Court, not the Supreme Court of the United States. I know this may seem dumb, but there are a lot of people who don't even know that state and federal governments are different things.
I may be a simple man, but after reading about NY I thought to myself that I'd like to have a "pizza of appeals" if there is apparently something above "supreme pizza' that I did not know about.  
I think it was a jnov, so yeah judgment as a matter of law. Rarely awarded, but procedurally needs to be done to move the case out of the trial court.
Probably judgement notwithstanding the verdict, no?
>Like these extremely rich people just have teams of minions protecting their interests and they just go on with their lives somewhat oblivious to all of it.

That exactly what it is. It's pretty ridiculous that these same people appeal to the value of hard work or talent in making your fortune.

I did it myself! I'm smart!

Yeah, you paid a bunch of professionals money you didn't earn to do that for you. Your only value comes from owning something, which is ass backwards if you want to live in a society where merit matters more than birthrights.
> Like these extremely rich people just have teams of minions protecting their interests and they just go on with their lives somewhat oblivious to all of it.

One of my dad's college friends ended up doing extremely well. Unless you knew about it, you probably had no idea. They lived in a nice neighborhood, but nothing gave away that the guy was probably banking 10 million a year. The only outward signs, maybe, was that everyone in the house had a car - 2 adults, 3 kids. I think only one of the vehicles was new. Other than that, nothing about these people screamed mega rich.

I really didn't know about all this til years later, but I had one clue that my child brain always remembered. The one son was about my age and he had the GI Joe Aircraft Carrier. I knew 2 kids who ever had one. And he had a personal army of Cobra foot soldiers. I had one. I knew there was something different about his situation compared to mine.

All of his kids were nice to me. I don't recall a single, "I'm rich, you're not" moment. They just had more toys than me and that was really the only difference between us. AFAIK, the dad kept them all grounded as shit in reality. He grew up some sort of middle classish, but certainly nothing remotely close to what he obtained. Of course he was making some of those millions a year illegally, but that's another story.

My point to all this is that it really is about how they are raised.
You ever read The Once and Future King by TH White?  It's a re-telling of the King Arthur legend, originally published as a whole in 1958.  The theme of the nobles treating life (war, specifically) like a game despite it ruining the lives of the vast majority of people was the most important lesson Merlin was trying to teach the young Arthur.  The nobles themselves were immune to the negative effects of their own actions - they were dressed in "armour" while everyone else wasn't.  Merlin didn't want Arthur to grow up to be a king that acted in a way that hurt everyone else just because he himself would never feel the repercussions.

https://i.imgur.com/YCQyWkQ.jpg
I think the kids parents and advisors were against it, not the kid in question himself. The part that always fucked with me is ivankas pitty me excuse over her fathers response to being bankrupt. He was talking about how the homeless man on the street was richer than he was. It was so humbling for ivanka. Yet, they still had a limo and a place(s) to live.  Bunch of fuck-tards!! 
I did enjoy young Ivanka. She was feckless even then! (I won't call her a cunt because I found Jesus)
Some people are born on 3rd base and think they hit a triple. 
Yeah, he seemed cool. The rest were douchecanoes. 
Doesn't the JnJ kid say that too? I remember him finding out he was rich when he saw his dad on the Forbes list.
I don't remember the specifics but the conversation he had with his dad where he keeps trying to interrogate him made me cringe. 
100% tax? That's laughable. You think the rich wouldn't find a way around this? Lol I'm just some idiot on the internet and I could come up with ways to do so.


Not all of the rich are terrible as you assume. You won't become rich by taxing them. While I agree there are segments of the population that would benefit from these "100% taxes" you propose, it isn't fair to basically steal from families who have been more financially successful than others.
Not really that suspect when you realize that she was an alcoholic that had been in two diabetic comas previously.
Money apparently can't buy medication adherence!
Tila Tequila claims the illuminati had her killed because they were planning on coming out against the illuminati or something.
That is a very ssuspicious way to die. Maybe that's code for overdosed. You'd have to ignore so many red flags to die without just taking insulin.

> I say they knew about it for decades that came straight from a headline last week about J&J using asbestos in their baby powder.

So, like, how did no one else report it? Are there odds of class action by workers who were working with this stuff? 


Extremely misleading. Talc and asbestos occur together and are mined together. That isn't a choice or decision to make. JJ does clean the talc very significantly based on regulations on asbestos exposure. There remains some, there will always remain some. It's a simple property of talc.
>	using asbestos

Not defending them, but words matter. Negligent about asbestos contamination is not the same as intentionally adding carcinogens in (like what tobacco companies did).

It’s like saying a poultry company was using salmonella in their egg production.
> they knew about it for decades and still did nothing

They knew in 1954 that their Italian source contained 5% contaminants by weight. They started processing those out as best they could to get them down to less than 1% by weight in 1956. By 1972 (when asbestos was banned), the equipment in use by the CDC and FDA had insufficient sensitivity to detect how much, if any, asbestos or similar fibers were present in random samples collected from retail locations. That means that the amount was at least 2 orders of magnitude less than the allowable limit.

However, up until 1972, their talc powder destined for industrial use only contained up to 3% contaminants by weight (but the amount of asbestos was never formally measured in it, just total contaminants).
Yup. Now you just have ass-mesothelioma. Not quite as entertaining as ass-flamethrower.
Mesothelioma < assothelioma
Mesothelioma from ass dust is bad.


I thought talc was mined in the same mines asbestos is mined from, so there was contamination by proximity going on. 
I remember liking the smell of it...
I'm walking the green mile I guess.
Well at least it's mentioned, my selfishness got in the way of anything else.
Well cosmetic talc has been in common use since the 1880s

Fun fact: Betty White is older than sliced bread.
Never heard of using bread as a treatment. Learn something new everyday.
Idk this is specific to Johnson & Johnson but I don’t know enough about talc to know how many possible sources exist and whose talc products are likely to have asbestos. 
Probably not, then. The reason asbestos was in J&J baby powder because it forms alongside talc, and it's hard to get it out. It doesn't seem like it would be specific to J&J- many talc products are probably contaminated, if not most. 
Mine is corn starch 100% talc free. 
Researching how to not use asbestos, by chance?
What about what Amazon did? They had one company that owned the intellectual property of Amazon and then they'd pay large sums to themselves in "royalties" from another company to decrease the profit and thus the taxable income of Amazon.

> Tell me, what banking scheme are you referring to?

The one he pulled out of his ass. 
I'm not aware of any direct connection between the outward facing parts of the lungs and the ovaries.
yes, of course. but talc powder isn't nearly as harmful to the lungs as asbestos powder. the question is how much asbestos was mixed in with the talc powder, if any.
Well, when most of the population is ignorant about statistics, and therefore epidemiology, it's kind of hard to convince a representative of that population, in the form of a jury, to follow the data.
In the state of california everything gives you cancer!
Pa, I got the white lung 
It has to infiltrate your body so unless your inhaling or douching it guys should be fine. The amount of asbestos in talcum is very minute. These days it should be practically zero.
This is only an issue if the woman of applying it in large quantities to their vagina, where it can get access to the ovaries.

Honestly, I'm still not convinced though. The research doesn't show with any conviction that talc use causes ovarian cancer. 
Wonder if it has any risk of causing prostate and testicular cancer in men.

> The lead controversy passed falsifiability, so did cancer for cigs, the others did not.

Yes ... after much fighting from corporations saying it wasn't so. I believe there was a lawsuit finding that tobacco companies knew while simultaneously arguing that there was no "definitive link?"  Same "no science" claims back from the same groups on lead in gas. 

Interesting that you are defending coal plants not linked to human health and humans not linked to climate change. 

Unfortunately for your claim: Direct correlation

* [Source 1:After a coal plant closed, children's health improved](https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2018/04/childrens-health-improved-after-coal-plant-closure/)

* [Source 2: Shutdown of coal-fired power plant results in significant fetal health improvement in downwind areas](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171221122409.htm)

Ditto for climate change but if you deny the science of coal plants and health - I'm guessing you'd deny the science of climate change too. 
> we start from the null hypothesis  and only reject it once there is evidence

And that evidence? Repeatedly we see the same funded think tanks claiming that there's no evidence of AGW climate change, no evidence lead in gas being harmful, no link between smoking and cancer, no link between coal plant emissions and human harms. 

And as more and more evidence comes up the goal posts keep moving about what "evidence" is acceptable. Usually there's much derision and marketing with false equivalents like what you posted

>* asbestos causes cancer
> 
>* your drinking water contains asbestos
>
>* your drinking water does not cause cancer
 
Except what's missing from all of that is the dosage over time (and the fact that thanks to modern technology, my drinking water does not have asbestos, lead, or even VOCs). That's as silly as saying "UV rays causes cancer, your sunlight contains UV rays, the sun does not cause cancer" . We do know that a lifetime of long exposures or a lot of exposure as a child is proven to be linked.

It's all good to ask for a scientific understanding of the issue - it is not to claim that everyone is an idiot except the science publishers at the corporate office who state that there's not sufficient evidence linking smoking to cancer. 
I stand corrected, but is there actually proof of asbestos? They found asbestos in talc, but wouldn't the FDA stopped it a long time ago if they knew? 
Have you read the article you link? The crux of the argument is that executives were concerned over potential links and that further improvements to quality control should be made, which is what they did.

If your argument is that J&J obstructing the release of potentially negative research was unethical, then I agree. But this is about whether J&J sells talc tainted with asbestos, which countless other third party groups have confirmed to be false. Equally unrelated to this argument are the age of my account and the amount of karma I have. 
Iirc, the name plaintiff was, but most had no relationship with missouri
[It looks like](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/how-did-jury-arrive-at-billion-verdict-in-talcum-powder/article_0ea0da33-d4ed-5966-b33f-39fa90c13b20.html) only 5 of the 22 plaintiffs are from MO. I agree that those five have the right to sue in MO, but the others may not given the BMS decision.

[Here's](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/talcum-powder-case-has-jurisdiction-in-st-louis-judge-rules/article_e335a96d-c406-5c1a-a98f-9199ea6a4b6f.html) another article discussing previous decision by Burlison on a separate talc case that had only 2 MO residents among 59 plaintiffs. The article discusses that ruling in light of BMS, which was used to overturn a previous MO court decision. Interesting stuff, for sure. I'm still guessing the plaintiffs in th $4.5B case lose on appeal, but I've been surprised before.
i would guess the suit was filed in missouri because they have special rules for class action lawsuits.  i think it is easier there to form a "class" of affected groups.  
Okay but how would that violate “due process?”

And HAPPY CAKE DAY
If anyone has watched Law & Order the court the trail takes place in is the New York Supreme Court and the presiding official is a Justice. After the Supreme Court you have the Supreme Court Appellate Division which is the first place an appeal is heard. Above the SC Appellate Division is the New York Court of Appeals (the highest court in NY state).

The Court of Appeals consists of seven judges: the Chief Judge and six Associate Judges.
You mean gubment.
A major problem is that current US estate taxes mostly affect those from moderately wealthy backgrounds; they do nothing for the families with $100 million and up; there are just too many ways to avoid paying them, usually through trusts but also things like asset shifting through (sometimes sham) companies, offshore banking, etc.
I think your comment just made most of downtown Manhattan sneeze.
Death tax needs to be much higher. There is nothing wrong with helping your own offspring.  The issue is the limit is way to high for tax exemption and the tax rate is too low. 
I'll be honest I would love to be that rich. Say what you want but I would.
Let's not forget that the people "earning" that money are also undeserving of it. You don't get paid because of how hard you work or how valuable the work you do is. If the richest person on Earth disappears right now, it's not like we'd all be struggling to pick up their slack because they were doing billions of dollars worth of work all the time. Many of the most vital jobs in the world are paid the least, we do ourselves harm by tricking ourselves into thinking there's anything okay with one person making a billion a year whole another can barely avoid starvation while also working more hours and doing more labour. 
>My point to all this is that it really is about how they are raised.

How they are raised often seems dependent on where daddy or that matter mommy got their money.  If dad/mom made it on their own they seem to more likely to raise their kids to be grounded and value the dollar more.  If it was handed to them the kids are more likely to be spoiled brats.
I grew up with a super close friend, who was damn near my older brother from a different mother (also different father our families were super close. Our dads grew up together). I found out quite recently that the father/dads friend of the house was incredibly successful. Never would have guessed they always had the worst beat up old cars, house was just above average, however they did have a dope pool though. The only thing that gave me the "duh" moment was the spot and land that the house was on... but younger me just figured they live out in the middle of nowhere so it wasn't anything special to young me. Turns out they owned ALL of the middle of nowhere.......

I agree its all about how they are raised!
Did you know that the US Navy has more GI Joe aircraft carriers than the entire rest of the world combined?
I remember seeing that GI Joe aircraft carrier at a local theme park and how awesome it looked.  But yes, good sign there.
Great book, it doesn't seem like as many people read it these days.  Another big theme was "Might for Right" instead of "Might *makes* Right."
I got you, bro. Ivanka is a feckless cunt.
I think the historical figure Jesus if given the opportunity would call her a cunt 
Yeah, he mentions that too. A lot of them didn't realize it growing up. Still, throughout the doc he was the most grounded. Rides the subway, has a job that pays $50k a year, depressed, thinks the whole system is fundamentally unfair. Just more normal than the rest of them.
"so you're saying your father donated 100%of his estate to your charity a week before his death? Very generous of him!" 
Oof a type one(I'm assuming) diabetic that's an alcoholic. A person like that should be on an insulin pump.
So she made good life choices then. 
Or a functioning pancreas it would seem.
Guess she lacked a Glucose Guardian 
But if the person you're with is *also* fucked up on drugs/booze and doesn't realize that you're dying, so they never dial 911? And maybe in your fucked-up state, you took too much insulin?
That was a disappointing dive. I was looking for funny bi shenanigans but got nazi and flat earther stuff. 
She also thinks the Earth is flat. 

E: Autocorrect is mean.
They are just trying to ask a question so why don't you teach them instead of answering a question  with another kinda mean question.
Insulin is the one that can kill you pretty quick if you miss it though.
Not really for type 1s, or that would kill you for missing. 
She was type 1 so yes it had to be insulin. Don’t be such an asshole. 
You realize there are two types of diabetes, right? She had type one, so it had everything to do with insulin. People with type two diabetes take the other medications. Huge difference.
Id imagine not many people knew. If i understand correctly its not like they went out of their way to have asbestos as an ingredient, its just that talc and asbestos form under the same conditions so most talc is likley contaminated with asbestos. Seems like something the science or QC branch of J&j would have known about and reported, but not something the average worker knew.
Possibly but for 2 decades?, how many people is that?, I wonder if they’d even bother.
They paid for the results to be altered and lobbied for lower restrictions on asbestos. 
> ass-mesothelioma

Thank you.  Made my day.
Gives you assthma.
My understanding rough though it is, is that they knew that the Talc contained Tremolite, but Tremolite is not asbestos unless it is in asbestosform, which most Tremolite is not. So it isn't that they knew there was asbestos in their product, but that they knew there was a material that in a fibrous form would be asbestos, but not that they had any indication of the material being fibrous 
Lol I do the same thing all the time no worries
How am I the only drum corps kid on earth that didn't need gold bond? I must have a magic undercarriage. 
Dear god man 
This guy marches!
And you know what? She can get this dick still too 
I believe Gold Bond is older than sliced bread also. 
Yeah, you use the bread to mop up the duck butter 
Based on an hour of cursory internet research, it depends on the mine that the talc came from. Talc and asbestos are apparently similar in their nature and often form / are found together in the earth. So, depending on which mine your particular bottle came from, and whether asbestos was present in the particular batch that was processed to fill your bottle... Basically, there's no way to know right now for sure... I used to be a daily menthol gold Bond in the socks.. but no more. The inhalation hazard is unavoidable.
The funny thing about research is that you don't need to produce results if you're paid not to.
It depends on the context we are discussing. On the financial reporting side of things, that is an expense for Amazon and will reduce their net income. However, the intellectual property is still going to be consolidated on their balance sheet. They can’t hide assets or liabilities, but they can take steps to reduce net income. This is perfectly fair play as long as it’s done under GAAP rules. They can reduce their net income playing by the rules and still have fairly represented financial statements. And at the end of the day, that matters a lot more given the damage fraud can do to the average shareholder (you and me, people with retirement plans).

Now in J&Js context with a fine, $5B is still a huge hit. That’s a third of their current cash and equivalents on hand, something like 8.5% hit to their last year end cash flow. It absolutely will hurt, if at the end of the legal process it stays that high. 
Which is something we’ve always known, so how in gods name do ignorant laypeople end up deciding scientific questions? It’s pure insanity 
Stay out of California!
For Christ's sake you've only been using it for one day
It doesn't even logically make sense that it would. The whole problem with the stuff is that the fibres get stuck in soft tissue, so how would they even make their way all the way up to the ovaries? 
You see, the asbestos fairy takes the asbestos fibers from the vagina, pries open the cervix, swims all the way up the fallopian tube, and stuffs all the asbestos into the ovaries
maybe if you pour it in your urethra.
Hmm, math checks out
I think he misspoke. I'll reiterate. Cigs, lead, and coal are able to be proven harmful, humans cause climate change. The others are not proven. Gmos are safe. Glyphoposphate appears to be safe. Talks
Talc is likely safe. Hey your head out of your ass.

This was not actually a class action. Just a case with joined plaintiffs. Not super hard to do in any jurisdiction. 

The real reason they decided to file in Missouri, and St. Louis in particular, is that the courts have become notorious for being super plaintiff-friendly. 

There could also have been an incentive to file in Missouri court because until recently MO had a "lower" standard for the admission of expert (scientific) testimony than many states or the federal courts. [Here's](http://www.smsm.com/blogs-litigationblog,raising-the-bar-missouris-new-daubert-law) some more background on the Missouri standard if you're interested and the changes that MO congress recently made.
Ohhh thanks didnt realize. 

Was in the process of editing because I realized I answered poorly. 

So the tort system is, as courts view it, a way to make plaintiff “whole” once again. Whether they incurred medical bills or, as in the instance case, were not fully covered for an insurance claim, the tort system looks to remedy the plaintiffs situation. 

The court does NOT like the tort system being used to punish. It is not meant for that. So it would violate due process because applying over 10:1 punitive damages looks like the court is punishing the company simply because “they can afford it” whereas a smaller company would not have charged as much. 

Edit: obligatory thanks for gold!
Due process is a nebulous concept.  But one of the fundamental principles of it is that a defendant will be treated "fairly" by the justice system.  Civil law is not generally designed to punish; rather, it is designed to make a victim whole again, as well as designed to help deter future bad acts.  Compensatory damages accomplish the former goal by paying the victim for actual losses and damages they have suffered.  Punitive damages accomplish the latter goal, by basically making the defendant pay a civil penalty to the injured party as a means of deterring the defendant from committing the tortious act again.

Generally, courts believe that there must be some type of reasonable relationship between the actual harm a plaintiff suffered and the need to impose punitive damages to deter that conduct.  Imagine a scenario where the amount of damage inflicted on someone is relatively minor, maybe resulting in a brief hospital stay with no permanent disability.  That person is certainly entitled to *some* form of compensatory damages.  But, if the damage caused was that small, there is less judicial interest in deterring that conduct in the future.  Conversely, if an action causes a victim a lot of damage, then there is a much greater judicial interest in preventing that action from happening again.  That's why the courts want some sort of reasonable relationship between the actual damages used to compensate the victim, and the punitive damages used to deter that conduct in the future.  

I think people realize that the ultra wealthy play by a diffrent set of rules. I just dont think that people realize how fucking amazing it is to essentially buy the laws you want. 
But haven't you heard?  Estate taxes are terrible!  All my republican friends who will never make enough in their lives to be affected by it have told me so!
You're not "moderately" wealthy if you're passing down over $11MM.
So this is going to sound odd. But I am literally being trained in how to move that money around and keep stuff from being taxed. I am an accounting major in college right now. It was literally a test question on one of my finals. But the most interesting thing is that you don’t have to be rich to do the money stuff that rich people do. People just don’t know the things they can do with money. Creating cover agencies for asset movement is extremely easy and legal. 
I worked (closely) with a 100+ millionaire. 

Shit just does not apply to them, it's wild


I have a story about when we went to the DMV together I need to tell sometime. 
Sometimes I advocate that we replace the income tax with an inheritance tax. If you earn it, you keep it. Once you are dead it’s gone. People get really mad.

Edit: One percent of the population will control 1/3 of the world’s wealth soon. Capitalism leads to large concentrations of wealth which stifles creativity. If not this plan the we need another.
> Death tax needs to be much higher.

The first step in accomplishing that is not calling it a 'Death tax'.
Until you can get all jurisdictions to play ball, raising the death/estate tax will just drive people to a more friendly jurisdiction.
I remember reading that inherited wealth only last about 3 generations on average. 

I'm assuming that dosnt really apply when your inheritance is more then most countries GDP. 
I mean, why? We have taxes all over the place. The money has already been taxed in numerous ways during the person's lifestyle. I'm not saying this is a bad idea. It definitely makes some sense. But I can't help that feel like asking for a higher "death tax" is wrong. It's not our money. It was taxed when it was earned (hopefully). It was taxed as it was spent. The unspent money shouldn't be taxed. I don't know. It seems like this is more of an effort to spitefully reduce the wealthy inheritances, which I get are absurd to you and me, but not our call to say they don't deserve the money their parents earned. 
50% is too low?
I have read that new wealth doesn’t translate well generationally, that you may get 2-3 generations of security.  I’d imagine it would be more how his kid raised their kids. You have generationally wealthy parents raising kids.  I imagine it’s harder to teach value when you’ve never experienced it yourself. 
The other kid who I knew that had one also had the GI Joe Space ships, both of them. I was insanely jealous.
Well I don’t blame too many people for not reading it since it is a very dense beast of a book, but the lesson certainly should be taught more. We really don’t have the same kind of self sacrificing leaders that Arthur ended up being. He switched England from being based on a king’s whim to set laws. Those laws came back to bite him in the end but he took the hit rather than switch back to the old way of doing things. Can you imagine Trump or any rich aristocrat doing the same?
He'd at least be wiping some dust off his sandals
For the human gene pool definitely.
Yeah, you’re not dying from missing your Metformin for a day 
Any idea how much of the talc was really asbestos?
Proof of purchase required. I hope your parents saved their baby powder receipts. 
Reminds me of the play Radium Girls
Yeah, you can see in their documents from reuters how in the 90's/2000's the tests were literally created and set up by J&J and they had a threshold where they called "statistically insignificant" so they'd raise it so positive samples would be ignored.
*slow clap*
That seems to be J&J’s take on it, but I don't think they are trustworthy especially when they have expressed concern over its presence for decades and during that time the regulatory agencies of OSHA and the EPA weren't making the distinction. 

https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/
The article I read that got that detailed about asbestos had quotes from one report in which a scientist said either that the particles were so fine it didn't matter if it was in the fibrous form or not, or said that the particles were so fine there wasn't a way to say for certain which form it was (and for something like asbestos it's better to be safe than sorry).

It seems to me like most of the scientists who researched it came to the conclusion that the talc in baby powder is not free of asbestos, until J&J had a talk with the scientists, at which point they would "reinterpret" their data and publish a "correction." Scientists also recommended that J&J test more talc than they do, and that when they do test it, to make it more concentrated (I can't remember if that was the exact word used, but it's close enough if not) before the test.
I concur; I've never experienced this through years of marching with a snare. Although, MA isn't exactly known for sweltering heat (during marching season that is).
Thick pubes bro!
I didn’t need it either. But I was in shape back then. Now I need it after an hour at the mall. 
Call her up "We'll bang ok?" 
That's the entire point. The billions in research get written off their taxes as an "investment in research". That foreign company marks it as profit and they don't pay taxes on it in the foreign country
Agreed. Hell, for sperm to get to the fallopian tubes, they have to friggin' swim. This shit can't swim. A woman would need to put a TON of this IN her vagina, it would have to go through the cervix, though her uterus, through her fallopian tubes, all the way to her ovaries. And if this is what's happening, why aren't we seeing women with cervical and vaginal and uterine cancer linked to this?
Ah... I see. I stand corrected. I had not factored in the asbestos fairy.
Damn it.  Guess I'll stop doing that then.
> Gmos are safe

GMOs are a massive class of modifications. There are some GMO's that are created as experiments that are toxic to mammals. (e.g. transformed with concanavalin A (ConA)).  Early 1995 versions of GMOs were removed from the market due to various measured harms to fetuses and mammals. 

TLDR; To claim all GMOs are safe/unsafe is to claim that all chemicals are safe/unsafe. Both are nonsense statements. 
[deleted]
Many courts, and if memory serves even the US Supreme Court, have stated that one purpose of tort law (even absent punitive damages) is to deter wrongful conduct. Punitive damages have that specific goal. In order to deter conduct, the award needs to take into account the size/wealth of the defendant. Mom and pop shops may not need a large award to accomplish the goal of punitive damages, but a big corporation does.
It's amazing how the Panama Papers came out and confirmed this and nobody cared.
dude they're just embarrassed millionaires, just you wait
Best test I've seen to see if you're affected by the estate tax: Are you comfortable calling everything you own an estate?
That’s funny, because I’m really trying to help my angry coworkers understand that this only applies if you have over $5 million. Even though most of them haven’t made over $18k before the Nissan plant came, to Mississippi.


Would you mind going into the details on how?
Or they don't have money to do things with.
Rich people don't know how to do the stuff rich people do. That's why they hire accountants and lawyers to do for them. 
Don't worry guys, this guy's got it ! We can all pull the extra funds out of our ass to start various offshore corps, etc. Oh we can't? LEL shut up.
> People get really mad.

Because for many middle class people, once they have kids, everything they do is for the future of their kids. Telling them they won't be able to pass anything down kind skews their whole incentive structure and worldview. 
That's far too easy to circumvent.  As soon as you have children you transfer most of your wealth to them - with no penalty as there's no income tax.  Your family then lives off the children.  When you die nothing gets taxed - because everything you own already belongs to your children.
Thats stupid. People should be free to give their money to who they want
Indeed. Estate or inheritance tax is the proper name. Death tax is what rich kids waiting for Daddy to croak call it to gain sympathy from people who will never worry about paying it. 
[deleted]
Why do Democrats always lose emotional posturing games like this? Calling it anything other than a death tax at this point is going to be seen as evasive semantics and weak. If you instead embrace it and not act like it's a bad thing you get a chance to change the narrative.

Yes, it is a death tax, Greg, if you want to be buried with your money go to ancient China or Egypt but this is modern America and we should not lick the boots of billionaires there way they did Emperors and Pharos. Tax the dead.
Three generations *of deaths* is an incredibly long time these days. 
President John Tyler has two living grandchildren.

Tyler was the *tenth* President of the United States. And his father was Jefferson's roommate in college. 
"Death" taxes are kind of weird, in a sense that they're purposefully unfair, and being a source of revenue isn't their main purpose.  The fact is, money makes money, a wealthy family can make the same amount of money in a few years on interest alone than a working class family will make in several genrations.   That wealth growth is exponential, and over time all wealth gravitates towards a select few.  We are seeing that now worldwide, where a tiny handful of people own more than several billion people combined.  And that trend is only increasing.  Proper death taxes force the ultra wealthy to give everyone else a chance by ideally shrinking the slice of the overall wealth pie a family own each generation.  Obviously a competent person who interest a huge amount of money and the connections and opportunities that come with it will be able to easily grow their wealth, but as long as we have all these clueless billionaires that continue to grow their wealth generation after generation via almost completely passive means, were going to see the slice of the economic pie owned by 95% of people shrink every year.   
The one thing about all those taxes though is that they all happen when money changes hands. When the money goes from one generation to another, why should it be exempt from being taxed?
Usually three generations for the absolute majority (9 to 1):

http://time.com/money/3925308/rich-families-lose-wealth/

tl;dr: 70% of wealthy families lose their wealth by the **second** generation, 90% by the **third** generation. 

I remember a quote from a pretty decent book called "Those who remain" (gets kinda repetitive) that - although of arguable accuracy - really applies to most of the idiocy we see these days:

>hard times create strong men,  
>strong men create good times,  
>good times create weak men,  
>weak men create hard times.
> Can you imagine Trump or any rich aristocrat doing the same?

Ha, nope!

[No specific numbers, but one study found the amount to be “rather high”](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/)
That's the thing. My mom beat stage 4 ovarian cancer after a hell of a long fight about 5 years ago. She's used powder almost her entire life. She grew up in the 50s when women used a lot of powder and it was routine to put it on after bathing. But she never kept any reciepts. We contacted a firm involved with the case and since she didn't have any proof of purchase she couldn't sign on to the lawsuit. 
>the play Radium Girls

Which was based on [a real group of women that were poisoned by the radium-laced paint that worked with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls)
Wasn't that real too though? 
Not quite, but I see where you're going with that. The radium girls story was so much more sinister, IMO. 
That threshold is still below the legal amount allowed by federal law.
From the article it would seem their argument is that the expressions of concern were over industrial grade talc, which is more likely to be collocated with asbestos and contain asbestos fibers. That would not impact consumer grade talc, which would make their stance consistent, regardless of if you believe it (and them) or not.
Four weeks of 12 hour rehearsal days in the asscrack of Florida is where I was introduced to chaffing. So humid that I was sweating enough to kill bugs that would land on me when they drowned in my sweat. Awful. 
The start of this convo was 

>But God knows how much they're dumping in offshore banking schemes.

And the answer is that we all know how much because it's being disclosed. They may be avoiding taxes, but they're doing it legally and we can see it go down. We know exactly how a Dutch sandwich works.
Exactly this ^^.

Now look at it from the money angle:

US woman has to pay lots of money for her cancer medical treatment, faces medical bankruptcy.

She hears something about ‘talc gives you the cancers’ and thinks ‘well, I did use talc a couple times. maybe I didn’t, but then again who can prove I didn’t use it! Heck I’m poor as heck now because of my treatment costs, I’m going to sue J&J to get money back’...
> Mind posting your proof that J&J’s talc contains asbestos? I’m sure the lawyers would love that evidence.

It came through discovery. [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/baby-powder-asbestos-johnson-johnson.html)
That’s actually a fairly devises topic, according to my torts professor. There’s a balance to be achieved, as Judge Cardozo sees it.

Except for in Iceland they cared. 
I think they just made the first charges in a legal case from the Panama Papers in the U.S.
*Temporarily* embarrassed millionaires
Yes, after I die.  But that's more because I do taxes and recognize it as a legal term.
Where'd you pull that 500M number from? It was 5.4 for a while, believe Trump raised it (by double?) But you're still pretty far off 
And thus proving the proletariat are the doers of the economy lol jk.
You don’t have to start offshore corps. Legally there is no distinction between a propietorship and an individual when it comes to taxes. Now you can’t discount taxes at a corporate rate, but you can make a small part time business doing something benign. Litteraly just start doing anything once or twice for a profit, and legally, you are a business. The important step here is to fill out the correct single proprietor business tax form. Also pay a small fee for the business recognition certificate from your municipal government. Mine here is literally 25 bucks.Then, you can buy ...say... a “company” car for that business. You can discount it from your taxes as a business expense. Pay those taxes on the minimal effort you did for the business. Then legally (as the company) sell it to you spouse, gf, child, best friend, whoever else. Sell it for something ridiculously cheap, and do the small taxes off of that sale. Then you can dissolve your business, and thus you have a car by proxy and usage, that you got to deduct from your taxes. I’m not kidding. It’s a rather convoluted way to get a car, but it does save money, and you can pretty much do it for any asset you can think of.
its like a premed major at a bar 
Exactly. It just further screws the poor by promising no one can ever reach a higher station while ignoring the rich. All they'd need to do is shuffle their money out of the country for a while.
The kids of successful people would still have a huge advantage. If we kept it up at their rate we will turn into morlocks and eols. You are right though.
No transfers of wealth on punishment of death?
That’s not how it works. Transfers don’t fall under income tax, they fall under wealth transfer tax (also called estate tax or death tax). The problem of the rich transferring assets before their death to dodge estate taxes has already been fixed.

As a rule, if you just came up with a tax loophole on reddit you’re probably not the first person to think of it. 
People should be able to keep the money they earn.
That’s exactly why calling it that must stop.
This is so true, look at the roster of the Senate and House filled with millionaires and wannabe millionaires. Anything to make it easier for them to make money, at the expense of the taxpayer. Democracy has been cut up and sold the highest bidder.

They mostly sold it on telling idiots their 80k family farm is subject to it.
Right?  You're talking 250+ years.
TL;DR 

Wealth trickles up, not down.  Estate taxes help reign in the snowballing exponential accumulation of wealth through generations
The entire western world is currently on step 4
Okay, you seem to be accusing me of being a Christian, using shit excuses to justify terrible behavior.

You're also coming on pretty hard with that hellfire shit to claim being an Atheist

However, here's an actual Bible quote, from Jesus, that I was referencing. A quote you were, I'm assuming, not aware of before passing judgement of your own.

>11 And  whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence,  shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.  
>  
>\-Mark 6:11 - King James Version

So, with that in mind, I find your scorn unwarranted.
Everyone likes to point out that the Bible has bad stuff in addition to the good stuff. But damn, people could use another look at the good stuff these days.
And that was the only study that found more than trace amounts. The scientist also declined to file his report with the CDC and FDA so there's no public record of his results. The other 19 labs that tested their products in the same year all filed their results with the FDA and CDC where they detected trace amounts below the measurable sensitivity of the best equipment available to them. That put that contamination at least two orders of magnitude below the legal threshold and on-par with background contamination in cities.
Wonder how much legal kung fu J&J is performing to keep that number to themselves.  I mean, whoever investigated it knows what that number is, and included it in a report.
Who the fuck saves 2 decades worth of receipts for baby powder.... This is so shitty, but I mean, I guess legally how would you even do anything about it at that point?
Yep. I even have a Russian watch that used Radium paint on it's face and hands. It used to be more common, though.
"legal amount allowed by law"

Except they lobbied congress to set that amount.  This is just a bad argument all around, as it suggests that anything isn't explicitly illegal is permissible.  Just throw ethics out the window and operate only on greed and human suffering as long as it's legal suffering.  At best your defense of J&J by going this route is that they care about your safety to the minimum level described by law and may be the least ethical corporation on the planet.  Like that's literally your best take.  
J&J allowed up to 3% contamination by weight of their industrial talc until 1972. That's contamination by anything other than talc. Between 1969 and 1972, they started putting the industrial talc through the same tremolite filtering that they had been subjecting their consumer-grade talc to for over a decade.
Doesn't seem like you went far enough in the article, because later they talk about traces of asbestos in type 96 samples, which was talc used in baby powder in Canada.  
Not true. Protests in Iceland ended with the resignation of the PM: https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2016/04/05/panama-papers-fallout-icelands-pm-resigns-ukraines-under-pressure-russian-billionaire-responds/

This is a great way to get nailed by the IRS in an audit.

Your odds of being audited might be low, but if this is your persistent strategy as an individual...good luck.


What about food, rent, utilities, child care and insurance?  Because that's what most people spend 90% of their money on.  What convoluted ordeal do I need to go through to write off rent?  Your car scheme is just that, a scheme.  Fuck up some paperwork, best friend crashes "your" car, or get audited?  You're fucked, or at least out whatever small sum you saved going through all the trouble and stress of running your sham business.

And even if you manage to pull it all off, most people would not be living large even if they got 100% of their taxes back.     
So it's a farm vehicle and I don't need a chicken in the back seat all the time? Awesome. 
You must not be very far along in your studies.  You can't just buy a car and say it's a 'business expense'.  The IRS has strict rules about ensuring you only deduct costs of the vehicle related to business use.  If you have any personal use of the car, at all, this will cut into the deduction.  In your scenario where you basically have a fake business generating minimal income, it would be difficult to substantiate a claim that any expense of the vehicle is of a business nature.  You also need to depreciate the value of the car - even if it were legitimate you can't just deduct the whole cost in one year.  And the subsequent sale well below fair market value, also not above board, makes it transparently obvious what you are doing.  This is tax fraud. 

You overstate how easy it is to avoid paying taxes - the tax code is extremely complex *because* it tries to address every conceivable way a transaction might occur to avoid taxation.

Ok I get it. It’s annoying having someone talk all high and mighty, and acting like a show off. And yah, it is kind of show off to drop in like this and just dump knowledge right here. But is it wrong? Is it incorrect? Or are we going to be like children here and just complain that the guy who is giving the information is an asshole, and completely write off the news he has given?
I guess it depends on how you want to look at it. Either 85 years for the first generation and then thirty-ish for the next two or 85+ for each full redistribution, with that likely to be longer in the future.

No matter what, hardly a trivial period of time!
Generally people leave wealth to their children. Inheritance doesn't work like Dalai Lama succession, where it passes to the baby born immediately after your death. So you earn the money in your forties, die at 85 and pass it on to your 55-year-old children, they die at 85 and pass it on to their children, and then they die 30 years later. So between the time you earn your money and your grandchildren die, that's about 100 years.
That's... not right. Nobody is having their children at 90 years old.
"The main thing I've realized in all my years of studying economics, is that regardless of us giving all the money to the poor or to the rich, eventually it will all end up in the hands of the rich anyway.

But when you give all the money to the poor, at least it touches their hands at some point."
Or step 1.
Yeah I remember looking into this and it really does seem like a bullshit court ruling which is absolutely not backed up by science. But of course this is reddit, so people just go with whatever feels like the biggest blow to J&J. 
That report was from the 1970's, it's possible the person who did the test is dead now.    


That's what's at stake though, the class action lawsuit could spread to over 30-40 years.  How many hundreds of millions of people were exposed to it?  
It didn't even have to be that. The paralegal said she just needed one reciept or even an old bottle of it. It's crazy because that is literally the only powder she ever used. She never trusted any other brand. 

I'm sure if we tried hard enough we could find something but she didn't want to pursue it. Dealing with the cancer took a lot out of her and I think she's just over it. But we're all glad this has come to light and that Johnson & Johnson will be held accountable if it is determined they covered it up. 
You need some way to prove it was J&J powder and not some knock off. I can't believe there's not a photograph of the mother's bedroom with a bottle in on the dress in the background somewhere.
It's good that something happened... but no where near enough compared to the scale of what the Panama Papers revealed. 
Iceland. You mean the populace of 250,000 and the only country to jail bankers as a result of the 2008 financial crisis? Yeah, they’re a nice asterisk. 
Because people are distracted by, in comparison to what the super rich can do, irrelevant shit. We’re all going to pay for it when the environment seriously falls apart and food gets scarce. Ugh. I get angry + nervous just talking about this. 
Because the conspiracy people would rather talk about lizard secret illiuminati shit than bland like Russian mafia and corrupt South American politician and shady banks in Cayman islands what's more exciting 
Is there a summary or tldr of this anywhere?
Conspiracy nuts are the fucking worst. You show them a real conspiracy and they'll not only ignore it, but will come up with an insanely implausible theory to dispute what is a real, factual, verifiable, ongoing, conspiracy before their very eyes. 
Parlty because reddits super conspiracy nut section has been co-opted by t_d and Russian bots since \#pizzagate. /r/conspiracy itself is a conspiracy. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
How many people even paid attention and then what do you want them to do especially post-9/11 police states?
I think the panama papers, for an average american like myself, was one of the cases of "no shit that's happening, why are we mad now?  We've known this has been the case forever.  There's been proof of it before and there's proof of it now."  It's easy to see why it blew over.. we're already indoctrinated to it.
Karl Marx actually discovered that sometime in the mid 1800s.
It's not a conspiracy it's the history of the world. Everyone acting like it hasn't always been this way is either stupid or complicit.
Right wing bullshit bubble appeals more to conspiracy nuts. The lack of logic is warm and familiar to them.

And probably a bunch of them are paid trolls these days.
Is it that boring in Iceland?
This is why it’s not the main Money making business. You still need a job and real assets. This is just a cover vehicle for shifting things around. Also, the best way to get around the IRS suspicion is to do a service type job where no one can really say if you are not doing business anymore or if you have just not done it in a while. This is exactly why the shell companies and whatnot are conference companies and financial advice companies and reference companies. It is much harder to say that you are no longer in the business of consulting than it is to say you are not producing a product.
Quite literally yes.... the problem is that this is where auditing comes in and the IRS will try to see what you are using the vehicle for. So you tend to have to keep up the “business” of things to make it still look viable. But I don’t think the government can punish you for running a shitty business that is “losing” money. My finance teacher did this with some equity assets and a small conferal business he runs. He was able to “sell” off this stuff to his son, all legally, and he has done quite well for himself. And this is a finance professor in college. Not some multi millionaire guy. I am telling you, it is really easy to do cool behind the door business stuff and come out positive on the other end. It’s not too extraordinary.
Bro, I liked your words. Took a screenshot to look into it later, but dude people are like that these days. Don’t be alarmed, asshats are everywhere.

I'm pretty baffled by all this tbh. JnJ argue that thousands of scientific studies prove that there's no asbestos in their baby powder. Assuming this is true, and I see no room for ambiguity, then there's no case right? So on what grounds are all the courts now saying JnJ is in deep trouble? 
Even more bullshit than the truly tiny amount of asbestos involved is the fact that the best studies find no correlation between baby powder use and cancer.
Like, ALL babies ever.
Is there a no tears version
And yet there will still be thousands of people that will be against this vaccine and will tell everyone and their dog that it causes cancer.
Hate to be the guy who gets the placebo.
To me, the injection treatment they're testing is a lot more exciting. Instead of taking pills every day, people can just get injected once a month. They might even be able to just get an injection once per exposure to HIV. The amazing technology behind it - nanoparticles - could work for treating and preventing other incurable diseases too.

The vaccine probably won't prevent HIV completely, it'll just make it harder to catch.
On one hand, this is good news. On the other hand, J&J are a truly evil company and cannot be trusted.
Damn just missed pride month
Before I start, I support vaccines fully. 

I cannot help but wonder though. 

Now with the flu vaccine sometimes you get the flu. 

With the HIV vaccine if it does not work does the patient get the HIV?

> Pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences, which dominates the $26 billion-a-year HIV drug market, reached an agreement with the Trump administration to donate medications that reduce the risk of HIV transmission for up to 200,000 people a year until 2025.

Snippet of the article. I suspect a lot of what about ism with this, but still cool the potus made this a focus.
Inject your kids with HIV! Yeah I'm sure that'll go over well
There was a lot of opposition to the HPV vaccine because religious types were concerned it would encourage promiscuity. They were more concerned with their children having sex than getting HPV and possibly cervical cancer.
Well that's sort of the problem when the makers of the product have a 4.7 billion dollar ruling against them for [Talc issues](https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Johnson__Johnson_deeply_disappointed_with_47bn_talc_cancer_court_ruling/145057) and oh [the whole Asbestos thing.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/johnson-and-johnson-baby-powder-asbestos_n_5c13bfc5e4b0f60cfa286b07)

>n 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was “detected in any sample” of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn’t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc – in one case at levels reported as “rather high."

They covered it up for decades.

So...Vaccines are good. They're great even.

J&J have some problems.

If a company was to come out with a product which ensured everyone would be immune to identity theft, that would be good.

If that company was Facebook, you'd be skeptical, yes?

Same here.
While still vaccinating their dog and not their own spawn. 

Gotta be up to date with the dogs kennel cough vaccine so we can board the dog and go on our yearly trip to the Jersey shore.
I'd like to see what these people would say after getting bit by a rabid animal. You think any of them would really take their chances? Rabies is 100% fatal. And a horrible painful death to boot.

You could be the one that gets horrible side effects and an HIV infection if it doesn't work anyway.
I remember not long ago it came out that they knew about the asbestos in their talcum powder and did nothing about it.
I coule be wrong but...

Flu vaccines don't give you the flu, usually you are already infected and it just takes a while to hit you, or it's just a cold. Or it's a strain of flu that the vaccine did not help against.

Flu mutates quickly, so every year scientist literally guess which ones will be common and make a vaccine against them 

I don't believe hiv is so mutation happy.

Again I could be wrong but my guess is there is a nearly 0% chance of getting hiv from the vaccines.
> Now with the flu vaccine sometimes you get the flu.


There is no live flu virus in flu vaccines. Unless there is a live HIV virus in this HIV vaccine, those who get the vaccine won't be at risk of catching HIV from the vaccine itself.
> Now with the flu vaccine sometimes you get the flu.
> 
> 

This is incorrect. What you get is an immune system response. 

Important to understand: When you get sick and show symptoms, you're not seeing symptoms of being sick. You're seeing symptoms of your body *fighting that sick*. Symptoms of a cold are not the effect of the rhinovirus, but rather the effect of your body fighting it.

When you get a flu vaccine, you're getting a dumbed down, disabled version of the flu, but your body thinks its still a contagion (it is), and in turn produces antibodies to fight it. You feel the effect of this in the form of mildly flu-like symptoms, but the virus cannot transmit (it can't replicate, it'll just eventually die, leaving you with the antibodies to fight it later). 

I don't know if it works the same as this HIV vaccine, but just wanted to clarify how flu vaccines work.
From what I know, there are a few different types of vaccines currently available: live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines. There's also "DNA" vaccines that are still in development. 

Some vaccines use a weakened version of a pathogen, while others use bit and pieces of one. Weakened pathogen versions are not used on those weakened immune systems, even though they are apparently more effective than some of the other types.
That’s why I’m anti-vax and anti-sex. No diseases will ever touch me!
A Google search has told me that you cannot "get" the flu from the flu vaccine, but it can trigger a response from your immune system that can give you some mild symptoms like achiness and a slight fever. In Google we trust.
J&J are a massive conglomerate, the guys doing vaccines are world's apart from talc guys.
So is that reason enough for you to refuse the vaccine?
Didn't that ruling use garbage science? Or am I thinking of the Round-Up case?
Flu vaccines are often under $25 without insurance, so no?
I recall there were 6 human test subjects for a drug for auto-immune disease, that had their immune systems literally destroyed; the company went bankrupt, and dumped their care (think Bubble Boy) on the UK government.

not easily finding a citation unfortunately, but I remember them since I have severe autoimmune disease, that they suffered to help me indirectly.
HIV has the highest mutation rate currently measured. It's extraordinarily "mutation happy." That's actually one reason HIV is relatively hard to get. Most of the individual viruses (virions) are defective from the extreme background mutation rate. 

That's why we are able to have a yearly flu vaccine, but so far no HIV vaccine has proven worth much.
That makes sense. I hope it works. The though of HIV being wiped out is exciting.
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm

Can nasal spray flu vaccine give me flu?
Flu vaccines do not cause flu illness. **The nasal spray flu vaccine does contain live viruses.** However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened), so that they will not cause influenza illness. The weakened viruses are also cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only multiply at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.
I appreciate it! Thanks for the explanation.
This is how all vaccines work. Safe exposure to the same/similar, but foreign, molecular structures triggers your body to create antibodies against those structures.

How the body does this is kind of awesome, but beyond the scope of a reddit comment.
I read that some vaccines also have an ingredient to aggravate the immune system, to make sure they take effect.
True enlightenment is imposs-
Are you anti-breathing and eating too ?
One thing is that people cannot sue vaccines makers. So no matter what happens they are immune. Kinda of a pun. If talc was in a vaccine form then talc lawsuit would never go though. They maybe far apart but the legal team is the same
No.  Honestly I'd probably refuse an HIV vaccine because I'm not in lifestyle or place where it is high risk.

I don't get blood drawn, or transfusions. I'm married to a monogamous partner. Both of us are terrified of needles for the most part. There are no outbreaks in our area.

But if trials looked good and testing went well and they put out a well researched, tested, and safe product I'd for sure get it for my kids.

I might even donate so that people who are high risk can afford to get it.

But I think regulations and the FDA need to be really fucking strict with them on this because they've got strikes against them. I would hope that people would agree that an actor with a bad history of covering up failed tests and harmful ingredients in their products that cause cancer might have to jump through expensive extra hoops to bring a drug to the market.

That's reasonable, yes?
No, but it does give ammo to the anti-vacation crowd.

“See?  They’ve covered up and lied for years!  They’re doing the same thing with vaccines and autism!!!”
I don't know how to answer this. 

You've introduced a question but...you aren't sure it applies to the topic either. 

So that puts me in the weird position of "Am I supposed to be trying to google Court Rulings+ Garbage Science?"  

Are you going to?


…. 



And who determines what garbage science is? You're not even a real doctor!


I'm sorry, that's uncalled for.  I do apologize.
Is the shell of the virus more prone to mutation than it's interior? Because then a vaccine that helps target the parts the change more slowly, like DNA/RNA could be used instead
Did you die?
God gave us mouths to breathe and eat, so no. 

God didn’t give me a vagina to have a penis put in it, he gave it to me to bare his children, just like Eve
Are you anti-humor?
You probably don't need the vaccine if:

* You aren't a drug user (or share needles)
* Have a monogamous relationship with someone who is negative or are otherwise not sexually active
* Even if the above isn't true for you, you don't have anal sex (vaginal sex actually has a pretty low infection rate compared to anal)
Fair enough, yes.
Maybe those people would be less angry if they took a vacation.
Well, that was cringeworthy.
The specific protein on the surface of HIV virions is called Env and is called the "spike protein" since it looks like spikes on electron microscopes. And yea, it mutates a lot, basically. There's been hundreds of pre-clinical vaccines tested in animals against Env. 

There isn't really a better option for vaccination, since other parts of the virus are not exposed to the immunological environment.
Ah,  asexual reproduction!  I like it.  You must be a hammerhead!
Wait, you're a woman? I hope your husband/father knows your on the internet...
Maybe he’s pro-woosh
You don't have to take one that goes somewhere, right?
I mean, a guy jumped into a thread about Johnson and Johnson and threw out a statement that only did one thing: Seed Doubt.

He did so without sourcing his statement OR even being sure it was relevant.

Spoiler Alert: **It Wasn't.**  He **Was thinking about the Round-Up Case** meaning that everything about what he did was garbage.

It's not on me to figure out what the hell he's talking about, but his statement throws doubt on what I'm saying just the same.
No I’m a woman of God
How about one that goes to a 3rd world tropical nation?
Seems further away than my house where all my stuff is located. Also potentially hot.
Direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs is only legal in the US and New Zealand. 

Notice how almost half of the commercials on legacy media channels are for prescription drugs? That's some serious economic influence over programming for news. Pharma doesn't like your exposé on prescription drugs? Pull the ads

If that's depressing, don't worry, [there's a drug for that](https://www.google.com/search?q=pfizer+circle+of+hell&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS617US618&oq=pfizer+circ&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.5231j0j9&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#imgdii=XMubasW1jUeOUM:&imgrc=SJKNOAFJXoObYM:)

>The information will appear on screen at the end of the commercial and include a website where people can enter insurance information to get more specific costs.

So in other words, not the actual price.
How about not letting drug companies market directly on tv?
Slightly off topic, but living in Canada we have access to US Network TV.  I swear some channels only advertise Law Offices to sue someone and Medications.  It's an odd uncomfortable watch.
There should be no reason for drug tv commercials. A healthcare professional should be the one to recommend therapy which makes commercials moot to the general public.
Can you just fucking not advertise drugs please? I promise you: I will **NEVER** decide what kind of medicine to use from a television commercial. Let's see... do I take the opinion of a person who has dedicated their life for decades to the study of chemicals and their interaction with the human body, or just watch a 30 second spot during an episode of Maury and wing it?
Ah J&J. Remember those guys? They're the lovely folks who continued to issue baby powder which they knew was contaminated with asbestos and gave a bunch of people cancer. Nice folks. Glad they're still around.
It's a marketing move. One that SHOULDN'T exist. The U.S. is one of two countries that allows drug companies to market directly to consumers. The U.S is also, EASILY, the biggest consumer of pharmaceutical drugs. No other country comes close. 

I wonder if there's a connection?
Great, maybe the ads will start to go away since they're fucking stupid anyway. Who the hell tells a doctor what they THE PATIENT would like to start taking?
"Your payment could be $10 with qualifying insurance." I can hear the bullshit already.
How about we ban ads for prescription drugs? The US is ridiculous in this aspect.
Does it also include the asbestos?
How bout we get rid of drug commercials like every other first world country. Instead of us as patients going to our doctors to seek certain drugs, let's just tell the doctors our symptoms and let them prescribe the necessary medications
Will they tell us how much asbestos is in it to while we are at it?
Ask your doctor if blahblahblah is right for you.  Side effects include dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, inability^to^urinate,^euphoria,^insomnia^analleakage^Listprice^$900each
I have a fun J&J story. 12 years ago I worked at a small health benefits company that dealt with FSA benefits. J&J paid said company X amount of dollars, got us new chairs, computers, monitors and phone equipment if we would scan receipts, along with participant data, to them.

What’s crazy is all this was done by the CEO’s kids who were like 14-19, in a locked conference room. Total HIPPA violations left and right. 
Right, because if I need the drug to live my life, I'm going to be looking out for the sale price. America; where we require you to have automobile insurance to drive, but don't really care if you drop dead from a preventable disease.
A small concessions for polluting more than any of us will ever know. 
Why don't we just get rid of ads all together? 
Why are there even drug commercials? Say that you have diabetes and a new diabetes drug comes out, you would figure your doctor would know about it and what’s best for you. But the commercials always say “ask your doctor if this drug is right for you” like tf. I thought he was supposed to tell me what to take not the other way around.
Man it's fucked up how they can advertise drugs on TV in the US
I can't get my head around drug advertising. (We don't have it in the UK). How can you go to the GP and demand a particular drug when you don't have the medical knowledge to know if it's right for your diagnosis (or what your diagnosis is) and aren't aware of the interactions/contraindications?

Even navigating the side effects can be tricky, for example prescribing something that has mood swings as a common side effect may not be advisable for someone with deoression even if its not directly contraindicated.  

Prescribing can be complex (I'm ex NHS) and to have people demanding drugs from their doctor because they've seen a celebrity swear it's 'awesome'.......I just can't. 


So now they're gonna make informercials?

"Call in the next 10 minutes and we'll double your offer! Two boxes of Sudafed for the price of one! Just pay separate shipping and handling."
Are they gonna let us know if there's asbestos in the drugs 
They poisoned mothers. How are they allowed to be in business. 
Anything to get the heat off their back about knowingly putting asbestos in your fucking baby powder for decades.
I don’t understand all the negativity in this thread. Drug pricing is fucked up. Most advertised drugs are around $3,000-$5,000 per month. Some of you with good jobs that provide a good insurance plan may pay a lot less and don’t care. However, many people have not so great insurance plans with high deductibles and get stuck paying a good portion of the price, or going without the drug. Yes, based on your circumstances the price you see may not be what you pay, but I don’t see any situation where knowing the sticker price is worse than not knowing the sticker price.
$5.99 for asbestos powder for your babies  
This J&J baby powder will only cost you YOUR LIFE!  
Maybe, just maybe we shouldn't be allowing drugs and medicine to be advertised on TV, etc?

You know, like the entire rest of the world already bans for the obvious conflicts of interest.  

Oh, and because they have national healthcare plans for all of their citizens so the price is irrelevant...
Remember when they knowingly sold baby powder with asbestos in it? 
Never forget.  J&J knew they were selling us cancer and gave no fucks. 
This literally isn't a step in the right direction. The commercials shouldnt be allowed to fucking exist 
This entire comment section makes Reddit look stupid.
Pointless or not this will bring attention the attention of drug prices to the masses. As of now its something we all read about or hear about but many people never actually experience it, with the actual costs hidden behind insurance. This could possibly do more good, in that people will apply pressure to whomever to lower the prices on these things.  
How about the details on those rebate programs that actually dictate the copay/coinsurances? The listing prices can be very misleading.
Like you would trust anything from this company after selling powder that causes cancer not caring how many people died from it.  When is Politics going to focus on how companies are allowed to put horrible ingredients that cause cancers and other illnesses in their products?????????  
Must be nice to be that big and powerful to sell products that kills  and not care as long as their making Money, Disgusting Don’t Buy Any Of Their Products PLEASE
Pharma commercials are one of the major reasons I refuse to pay for cable TV.  These long, boring and sometimes disgusting commercials make cable TV unwatchable.
Maybe they should advertise asbestos in their baby powder too.
What’s TV?
That’s because they are trying to take the heat off the fact baby powder has been linked to causing cancer. They have known it contained asbestos for a long time. Pieces of trash. 
Kiwi here, our drug ads are nowhere near as bad or misinforming as the US’s are 
I bet they’ll be like car commercials with low APR financing! 
Johnson and Johnson sued the Red Cross over the use of the red ➕ .
This is a cynical PR move.  The pharmaceutical industry is starting to realize they have to get out in front of the wave of popular discontent over our exploitative healthcare system.

The big pharmaceutical companies need to be heavily regulated; their patents reduced in length or taken away entirely.  Advertising on television needs to be banned.
Gluten Free asbestos powder 
Have they stopped killing children with greedy practices and asbestos? 
J&J lists their prices and Bud Light lists ingredients on their packaging? I feel like they're somehow pandering but it's smart PR.
Talk about baby talk murderers there. On the other hand, what does difference does it make to show the cost on TV? Will people get influenced and go ahead and buy pharmaceuticals just because they’re cheaper or because their doctor prescribed them to them?
Or... ya know... single payer.
Of the two Johnson companies (J and J&J) isn't J&J the one that's not totally shitty? I can never keep them straight.
Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending. Anyone who thinks differently from my point of views, but also looking into this matter in a deffirent perspective and without being condemning of one view and by trying to make it objectified, and by considering each and every ones's valid opinion, i honestly believe that i completely forgot what i was going to say.﻿


How about you list the jets and sell them already. The johnsons suck.
Johnson and Johnson sounds like a great gay porn production team. 
I didn't read the article but I'm gonna guess its something like what Bud Light did with the nutritional information on their boxes.  They knew they were going to have to do it anyway so they made sure they did it before anyone else to make themselves look good. 
For real.  What a stupid practice.  I wonder how much the real cost of drugs could go down if stopped spending so much marketing and advertising dollars on them.
There are also ads for prescription drugs in Canada. There are different regulations around them though (like you can only tell people to ask their doctors about the drug, but they don't have to spend half an hour listing every possible side effect at the end of the commercial), which leads to some [pretty good ones](https://youtu.be/sMxIS7-94S0). 
I'm not saying there isn't a lot behind the scenes but there's a lot of Pharma ads on legacy media channels because the demographic consuming that media is an older generation that trusts the traditional health industry and will buy it. 

I mean, the original linked article here is from CNBC. I saw a piece last night on NBC Nightly News that was absolutely eviscerating a company that basically took the formula for an existing, free prescription, tweaked it ever-so slightly, and is now charging $375k for an annual supply because they also bought exclusivity.

Again, totally agree that pharma has too much power, but they don't run the news media. 
Every single one of those drugs in that chart has a generic just so you know. Pfizer doesn't even manufacture the brand name of some of those anymore. 
Suddenly, Netflix walks through the door...
That circle is so fucking stupid because these effects are super rare, but yeah let's bastardize information again and misinform people. smh
Personally I'm not in favor of a nanny state controlling my access to info of any kind. Let the drug companies advertise but require each ad include pricing information so people understand what they're looking at. Denying the public access to information about drugs except through their doctors seems to not be the best idea. 
[deleted]
How does that work? Why would they advertise a product you would never get without a prescription anyways? Shouldn’t they be advertising it to doctors rather than consumers?

I wonder who is going to be watching TV and suddenly be convinced that they need to get a prescription for that “on sale” heart medication.
“Very cool and very legal”
Hmm could this be why the media shills vaccines so hard?
>36 hours after posting this article on the HHS blog, the married father of three committed suicide via multiple blunt force injuries

Nothing suspicious about that...
Why do they even bother telling us it was multiple blunt force trauma, then say suicide? It sounds so unbelievable, I dont know what else to say.
Most other nations limit profits from drugs by using government mandated policies, which is why they are so low. Has some negative side effects overall, along with postive.
Wait what? Are we just casually not talking about this? How is this the first time I've heard of this? Is Big Pharma literally just whacking people like the Corleones?

I'll take the bait.... can a person really bludgeon themselves to death?   If so, would they do it outside the exit to a public building?  

This has all the bad stuff in it
Cost = sticker price
That sticker price gets paid by your insurance and you. What you pay is you insurance's negotiated piece of the sticker price.

J&J is trying to be "transparent" and really start putting the pressure on insurance companies for high patient responsibility costs. 
When i'm president of the universe, i'm going to enact a law that anything that costs money must have a menu stating how much it costs. I'm sick of car dealers, or health insurance providers, or new york street vendors deciding the prices of everything on a case by case basis for the sole purpose of trying to figure out on the fly how much they can get you to pay for it.
Basically, it looks like the pharma version of this. 

Customer: how much is this product?

Pharma/Insurance chimera: how much money you got?
Ballpark figures for the uninformed.
Different insurance companies have different coverage rates. Theoretically, the listed price would be what you, personally, would pay for it without any insurance involvement and the calculated price should only ever go down from the listed price.

Former pharma worker here- Even if you cut out tv ads you would still have mailings, web banner ads, magazine ads to get to consumers.  (Similar to cigarette adertising in years gone by)  From what i understand, there are two arguements for tv drug ads.  From the consumer side, it advertises symptoms that a patient might not notice they have and go to the doctor to say "i have been experiencing xyz.. will abc drug help"?  I believe it is the big reason for the increase of erectile dysfunction and cholesterol drugs becoming blockbusters.  Now they could just start advertising "disease state" ads that dont have a brand associated to it.. but that wouldnt benefit the drug cos... unless they are the only drug on the market. 

On the businees side.  TV companies make a fortune on drug ads.  I would imagine the tv lobbyists and pharma lobbies would be lining up to make sure tv ads still stay on the air... if a ban was proposed.  That is not to mention the advertising agenecies that have whole divisions created for drug marketingm.  It is a huge driver for these ad agencies. 
First Amendment.  Better to have bad speech than the government have the power to shut down speech.
Hey now! They also advertise payday loans and catheters!
Even better are the law offices that will sue drug companies and medical device manufacturers.
But I need to ask my doctor about a pill that allows me to stroll through sunlit fields smiling that also comes with a long list of side effects
You might want to talk to some actual healthcare professionals then, because most of the ones I know are happy for TV advertising, since it encourages patients to talk about their issues. So many people have had their quality of life increased because what they thought was normal turned out to be treatable, and they only brought it up after a commercial. 
I'd rather the television tell me that I'm sick.
This assumes healthcare professionals aren't marketed to as well, which, they are. 

Eat right and diet folks - stay away from doctors and hospitals if you can!
I can say that I think it's good that they advertise symptoms to be aware of. Many conditions have a way of creeping up on you without being aware that something is actually wrong. 
>Let's see... do I take the opinion of a person who has dedicated their life for decades to the study of chemicals and their interaction with the human body, or just watch a 30 second spot during an episode of Maury and wing it?


You shouldn't do either. If the opiates epidemic has taught us anything it's that doctors are susceptible to bribes. 

Doctors are also human, so they do make mistakes, including when they're selecting which drugs to prescribe. Listen to your doctor, but do your own research and question them if you have concerns.  

Research drug interactions with drugs you're currently on and common otc drugs (Tylenol, Benadryl etc) as well as interactions with vitamins and supplements. 

Research all the drugs that can be used to treat your condition and ask your doctor "why do you think I should take this drug, and not this drug?" if you think there is a better choice for treatment.

They wouldn't do it if it didn't work.  
well ya might be able to get a better deal from the local street pharmacist.
Pharma companies tv advertisements are also for doctors and other healthcare professionals. Check the time of programming they advertise to  and the language they use then you will see it’s not just for “normal” people. 
Would've been noticeably worse if recreational drugs were encouraged and promoted, this is at least medically motivated for citizens necessary rehabiliation as a last resort.

I don’t know if every pharmacy does this but Walgreens shows how much the drug would be without insurance. I’ve picked up meds before, looked at that part and thought “wow! No wonder people end up so bad off!” 
If basic mental health drugs can run into hundreds of dollars a month without insurance (which a lot of Americans don’t have) then you have to make a choice between eating/feeding your family/keeping a roof over your head/etc. and taking your happy pills. Shit. Might as well just go crazy. 
Auto insurance is to protect others from you, though. Health insurance is to mitigate the costs of medical care. 
General resentment for pharmaceutical industry in the US? The fact that they gave kids cancer in the past? He transparency in this move as a PR stunt that shouldn't even be a thing because television advertising for medications is asinine and helps overmedicate rather than cure?

>  I wonder how much the real cost of drugs could go down if stopped spending so much marketing and advertising dollars on them.

Presumably the marketing more than pays for itself, otherwise they wouldn't do it. 
People won’t go to the doctor if they think they will just be told there’s nothing they can do.  Giving information to the consumers is *never* a bad thing.  
Making a single drug costs 100-1000M, I don't agree with it but they need to make the money someway.
> There are different regulations around them though (like you can only tell people to ask their doctors about the drug

That is pretty boilerplate language in American drug ads too: "Talk to your doctor and ask if _________ is right for you." 
Its not supposed to be taken literally, it's obviously over exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The point is that meds with certain side effects that don't tend to go away for some people forces them to take additional meds to combat side effects of the other meds, (whether it's prescription, or over the counter). 

I don't think people take 5 different meds like that circle says, but speaking from experience (at least with mental health) people don't just take *one* prescription.
Where you’re wrong is assuming that “advertising” is “access to info” and by denying advertisement is “denying the public access to information.”  
Advertising, by definition, is biased. All information that an advertisement provides is available through multiple other objective outlets and sources. If someone is experiencing symptoms that a particular medication would help alleviate, a google search or a visit with a qualified doctor would put you in the right direction.  
Virtually each ad for prescriptions tell you to “ask your doctor about X.” If the solution is so obvious that a consumer can recommend it to someone with a Ph.D, it’s nearly certain that the individual with the doctorate would have identified it.

People do NOT understand what they’re looking at because they have no formal training. Seeing a price on a commercial would not better inform a consumer since there are nearly always alternatives that a qualified doctor would be aware of.  
I understand that medical professionals are visited by pharmaceutical companies and they are bought lunches and given incentives for prescribing specific things. But it doesn’t matter what the consumers request from their doctor. If the prescriber does not agree, they won’t do it. The only benefit from prescription drug advertisements is the awareness piece of descriptions of symptoms and conditions. If consumers bring those concerns to a medical professional, it is that professional’s job to properly assess the situation and go from there.
Why the hell does the Everyman need to know about ALL the colitis/hpv/Ed/chrons/acid reflux/depression/fibromyalgia PRESCRIPTION drugs on the market? It's the DOCTOR'S responsibility to prescribe the best and must appropriate drug for the patients condition.  The harm is John Doe going into his checkup and REQUESTS a script for Lipitor ($200) when the doctor would have prescribed the generic alternative of Simvastatin ($20) had she not been prompted by the patient.
So basically, somewhere around the end of these commercials, they always say "ask your doctor if this medication is right for you" and they never show the price. The commercials are always long af too.
How the fuck does someone give themselves multiple blunt force injuries prior to killing themselves?

How the fuck is that not suspicious?

Big Pharma has officers/detectives on payroll

Falling/jumping off something
Ah yes the ol’ Russian suicide 
Not saying that suspicion is unfounded, but I'd imagine if you had some kind of psychiatric break and started smashing your face into a wall/table, that would count. 
Based on his facial expressions, he caught himself by surprise.
Multiple blunt force injuries can be sustained jumping out of a building, for example. Noting that cause of death certainly doesn’t imply that he beat himself.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/daniel-best-suicide-foul-play/
Because the author was trying to give you a hint even though the powers at be told them to run the story. Or that's my guess.
This is because those countries are allowed to negotiate drug prices. Meanwhile, Bush made it illegal for the federal government to negotiate, which means that Medicare and Medicaid, collectively the largest payer for health care in the US, must pay whatever the drug companies decide. And individual insurance companies are too small to negotiate (and they can't just stop paying for lifesaving drugs.
I'm mildly impressed this has gone 4 hours without someone denouncing potential negative effects
> Wait what? Are we just casually not talking about this? How is this the first time I've heard of this? Is Big Pharma literally just whacking people like the Corleones?

Its all conspiracy non sense. A bunch of misleading information designed to paint a fake picture of reality.

>married father of three committed suicide via multiple blunt force injuries

The fact that he was married and had 3 kids has no significance on his suicide. The rates for married/non married and with-kids/with-no-kids committing suicide is the same. Multiple Blunt Force injuries just means he was injured in more than one location. If you get hit by a car you will have dozens of blunt force injuries. It's all wordplay to mislead you.

Ex:

"A few months ago the military did tests that simulated planes flying into buildings. For a few nights before 9/11 there were mysterious trucks at the building that were unmarked. No one knows that whey were doing. This Engineer that used to teach at X University believes explosives were involved."


Absolutely, they have much more to lose. We’re not talking millions, we’re talking billions and billions of dollars.
The real gangsters are no longer in dingy strip clubs, pizza shops and other fronts, they sit at big tables for board meetings in skyscrapers now.
You added the word bludgeon. Multiple blunt force injuries sustained in a jump from a building is not unreasonable, if he jumped. The linked article has almost no information besides "multiple blunt force injuries". There is a whole load of fear mongering and conspiracy theorising going on over nothing.
This is just a public relations stunt.  

J&J is just trying to make themselves *look* transparent - the information they provide is basically useless without consulting with third parties.
Nope. Sticker price is what poor bastards without insurance get charged before they go bankrupt. The cost paid by you and your insurance is a negotiated rate which is often only a small fraction of the sticker price. 
To clarify: what you pay is your copay portion of the negotiated rate, and a deductible may make your copay higher until complete. However, by law you will never pay more than the cash price through insurance. 
> That sticker price gets paid by your insurance

You have absolutely no clue what your talking about in the slightest bit. 


Prices should be fixed (the same for everyone), and advertised clearly.

God forbid we apply common sense to healthcare and other areas where retailers already abide by these rules.
Yeah that would be great but I've never been to New York and wonder what you mean. They don't have a little sign showing the price but couldn't you just ask beforehand? If they try to give you a different price afterwards then refuse the food and don't pay. 
Under the current system, you can avoid getting ripped off at a car dealership. Under your proposal, you will always get ripped off, because they would be barred from negotiating price. How are you better off?
I live in one of those countries and I still think it’s fucked up.
Don’t forget about the drug merch, I have a nice Xanax sports bag to carry around all my Ambien Mugs and Vioxx ink pens (those are quite rare to find now so I feel very lucky to have them)
That's not how the first amendment works at all and companies aren't people and don't have rights.
So why can't tobacco companies advertise on TV? 
Oof right in the cable package.
I don't know how 99% of the world lives without being bombarded with drug ads. Europe must be a mess.
Those doctors are also most likely taking kickbacks from the very same pharmaceutical companies who advertise prescription drugs. Health care in America is big business. 


 Here is my thought process as I read your comment:

> This assumes healthcare professionals aren't marketed to as well, which, they are. 

Very true, and also a problem.


> Eat right and diet folks

A healthy diet is always good advice...

> stay away from doctors and hospitals if you can!

Watch out this guy is a crackpot

The commercials should **not** have the NAME of the drug but say something like "there is a new heart medication out for people with these symptoms, ask your Dr."
They were. You're no longer allowed to advertise cigarettes. Alcohol on the other hand.
Asbestos: At Least It’s Not AIDS!
That’s the slogan, right?
My understanding is the U.S. consumes about 75% of the worlds opioid prescription drugs despite being only about 5% of the world's population. 
Well you almost lost me there but, did you say it would make me fabulous?
You can also Google wholesale prices of drugs to find out what pharmacies pay for them typically. [Humira for example...](https://metromedicalorder.com/humira-pen-40mg-2-pk.html)
I think that was his point, the situation could be summarised: "I don't care about you, just don't fuck my shit up".
Which was immediately appealed...Gotta wait until they go through the court system.
Wow. Nothing fishy in that story at all. 
When I google his name it says he died in 1923.
$50B over 8 years doesn't sound like much. You sure that's it?
It is when it costs the patients a shit ton of money on the back end. 
Totally understand that. But they should make money by doctors prescribing to patients when they need it. Not because they’re compensated or because the patient is marketed to. 
You underestimate just how stupid people are.
Incentivizing providers to write scripts for specific medications is illegal under the Sunshine Act. In fact, providing anything of value beyond $10 requires that the physician and pharma company report it to CMS. 
If people see the prices on an advertised drug they can decide if they're even interested in paying for it. Telling someone to "ask your doctor" isn't exactly "recommending" it. The whole point of "asking" your doctor  is to get more info. If he knows of a better, or cheaper, solution that's when he'll tell you. I just don't want the government deciding what information must be withheld from me "for my own good". It's not their place to substitute their judgement for mine when it involves only me.
He jumped off a building
This is most likely just a result of lay people not understanding how technical terms are actually used.  

Multiple blunt force injuries doesn't have to mean repeated blows, it could also refer to multiple injuries to the body resulting from a single incident such as striking the ground after jumping from a building.  

Breaking your legs and hitting your head from the fall would be "multiple blunt force injuries".

[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/daniel-best-suicide-foul-play/)

> There’s a fallacious assumption underlying this notion, however: namely, that blunt force injuries can only be sustained in the course of a physical attack by an assailant (or oneself). But that isn’t how forensic pathologists define “blunt force injury.” According to Prahlow and Byard’s Atlas of Forensic Pathology, a blunt force injury is any “resulting from impact with a blunt object, i.e., one that does not possess any sharp edges”:

>To date, we aren’t privy to a full account of how Daniel Best sustained his injuries, nor their precise nature, nor any other evidence (such as a suicide note, if one exists) that prompted medical examiners to conclude that he killed himself.

Given the facts at hand, there is no reasonable basis for speculation to the contrary.

Dude. Having been on deaths do you realize how many people would need to be silenced? It’s ridiculous to think. Firefighters. Paramedics. Cops. But whatever fits your narrative.
[deleted]
You wouldn't even need to hit multiple things on your way down, just have multiple points of impact with the ground. Broken limbs, skull and/or contusions everywhere = multiple blunt force trauma. 
>There’s a fallacious assumption underlying this notion, however: namely, that blunt force injuries can only be sustained in the course of a physical attack by an assailant (or oneself). But that isn’t how forensic pathologists define “blunt force injury.”

That's the entire basis of the snopes argument and what they spend their entire article supporting. The thing is, though, that isn't actually why people are calling this suspicious.

Snopes in this case seems to have deliberately ignored the fact that people are calling out that it was "**Multiple** blunt force injuries". I.e., the issue isn't that the injuries were caused by blunt force, but rather that it was several in sequence.
More the M.E. maybe it's the same for them, they say how they died but are forced to rule it a suicide. 

I hope they aren't willing participants anyway.
It wasn't Bush necessarily, it was lobbying efforts from PhRMA during Medicare Part D legislation and the ACA. You seem to understand what's wrong with our drug industry, more info here if you're interested :) - https://sunlightfoundation.com/2010/02/12/the-legacy-of-billy-tauzin-the-white-house-phrma-deal/
People have committed suicide by several bullets to the back of their head with their hands bound for a lot less money.
But how high up does this go?!?! There's no way things like this can happen without the Gov't being complacent. We have an entire department of Health and Human Services privy to this and nobody is asking questions?
And in the White House and Senate.
I see where you're coming from, but that's not the right way to look at it

You advertise a $2.99 hamburger on TV. But taxes are different in every state. In one state it is $3.05 post-tax. In another it's $3.16.  Is that your fault? Are you just trying to *look* transparent? 

Compared to a competitor who just says "we have the best and cheapest hamburger"
To be fair, there is no price they could put there that would be true for everyone since everyone has different insurance. 
I don't really see how.  I mean, I would say they are doing it for good PR, but they don't have total control of the sales price.  It's not just insurance, the pharmacies can also add a pretty big fee.
I was gonna say, no way in hell they would do something like this unless the positive PR feedback would make up for the marginal losses of profits.
Yes- i think they're just trying to move the cultural pressure of high prices to the insurance industry from big pharma. Unlikely that this will work.
Unless they know your insurance plan they can't tell you what you would be paying for it, the best they can do is provide the generic price. 
You're right - i should have said "sticker price is the starting point before insurance dictates, i mean, negotiates a price".
In what part of the world does someone buying in quantity pay the same as someone buying one? 
What if someone can't afford a procedure :(
The nicer stands and chains have prices. The small independent ones just have what they're selling and when you ask how much they'll size you up and say what they think you're willing to pay. One time I went and bought a Gatorade and the guy charged me $1.50, then some middle aged lady came behind me and got a Gatorade and he charged her 3$. This also isn't just street vendors. There's restaurants that cater to locals, with no prices on the menu, and if they don't recognize you they'll charge a lot more than the construction guy whose been working across the street for the past 3 months.
Because prices are transparent so (in a vacuum) dealerships would compete for customers by either lowering prices or adding services to justify prices that are higher than a competitor.
I don't see how that could possibly be true.
👆🏼 Relevant username right here.
there's drug swag? well boy howdy ain't that some shit?
Yeah.. but a lot of pharma has gotten away from the pens and mugs.  The money is more effective to be used for doctors at speaker events and direct marketing at docs offices 🙄

Companies are made up of people.  Those people have freedom of speech.
Read up on Citizens United v. FEC
They voluntarily decided to end television advertising as part of an agreement so they could get the positive PR and not worry about being hit with a bunch of restrictions as part of a formal legislative effort. 

Edit: I was wrong. See comment below. Leaving my comment as is for clarity. 
That argument regarding opioids specifically doesn't support the assertion that the US is the biggest consumer of all pharmaceuticals.  I suspect it is true that Americans consume more meds than the average person on Earth but I doubt the US consumes 75% of all cancer drugs or antidepressants.
"Multiple Blunt force injuries"

"It was ruled a suicide"
I actually only recently found out that they pay doctors to push drugs they make and since it's a doctor telling you, you'd listen to them
I don't understand why everyone is so against marketing drugs. How can you be against advertising chantix to get people to quit smoking?
If it involves only you, then you have the ability to research it. If it involves being advertised to you, then it doesn’t involve “only you.”

step 1, have a hundreds of billions of dollars. step 2, figure out 25 (lets say 200, even, for the sake of argument) peoples "price". step 3, pay each person $50k to agree that this person bashed themselves to death. $10M. we're talking 1% of 1% of 100B which is a hair in the shower drain to these companies. paying for silence is not some unheard of concept.

edit: searched actual figures on big farma money pools. looking about US$245B combined top 10 pharma co revenue in 2018. so. less than 0.005% to pay out this hypothetical.
I think you're conflating, or equating, the researchers/scientists with the executives/board of these companies. No one here is begrudging the researchers/scientists (at least not from what I can tell). The problem is the execs whose entire purpose for being is to drive profit and prevent anything from getting in the way of that.
The scientists are not the ones people are upset about. The scientists want to spread the cure to the world. The executives want to lock it up and make people pay a thousand dollars for an epipen.
maybe the researchers do  


the martin shkrelis of the world are not on a mission to save everyone's families
So, 7 years until the extinction of the Human race?
People often do sustain multiple blunt injuries jumping to their deaths. Don't know if that's the case here, but your point is moot.
If someone jumps out a window. It's not just one part of the body that hits the ground. So they would suffer multiple blunt force injuries. One for each area that made contact with the ground.
I’m under the impression that the medical examiner didn’t release that detailed of information. I didn’t read anything about injuries in “sequence,” just that there were multiple traumas. Maybe I missed that somehow but it’s entirely plausible and even likely that a fall would inflict multiple blunt force traumas (i.e. trauma to the head, back, arm, etc.)
This whole comment chain is pure, concentrated stupid.
It always blows my mind when people can’t imagine how a corporation that basically controls an industry worth billions to trillions of dollars would commit crimes to protect their money.
Have you seen who is in charge of our country.
> To be fair, there is no price they could put there that would be true for everyone since everyone has different insurance.

Or none at all. Don't forget about the millions of Americans without insurance (myself included). I guess it's all kind of arbitrary what price I would get...maybe they would do a discount since I don't have any kind of plan, or maybe I would get hit with the full inflated price they came up with to milk insurance companies. 
There's nothing stopping them from charging 29.99 to everyone period.
How is that at all important to the discussion?  No one said otherwise. 
The patient goes into debt or the hospital writes it off as a loss.

Same thing as any other business selling a product.

Prices will reflect the possibility that this scenario will occur.

So they couldn’t offer a discount to someone for signing today, or accept a trade in? Because as soon as they do, you’re back to the old system. 
I’m the son of two nurses, the best days were when  either one of my parents came home with a shit ton of leftover food from a massive event one of the company’s held. This doesn’t just go for meds too. 
so we can toss the entire corporate structure of "Big Pharma" in jail for being an accessory to murder? wrt the ongoing opioid crisis.
Oh, cool! That means they can get the death penalty for killing people with drugs marketed for off-label use, right?
Or hell just think about it for a couple seconds.  If companies have *no* rights, that means they have no right to sue, they have no right to not have their property stolen, no right to due process.  The government could legally confiscate everything a corporation owned if that were true.
If you mean the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 then that banned a lot of the print/billboard advertisement, event sponsoring and some other marketing practices, but TV ads featuring cigarettes were banned in 1971 after the passage of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act the previous year. So, no, it wasn't a voluntary act. It is specifically banned by federal law.
Well, if you doubt it I guess you could look it up. 

I also said "opioid prescription drugs." Not cancer drugs or antidepressants. Different things. 
To be fair, that's pretty much exactly how the examiner and coroner respectively would describe death by jumping into traffic (for example), so it isn't impossible. Not what happened in his garage I imagine but they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
Check out the [Snopes] (https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/daniel-best-suicide-foul-play/) piece on it.  

TLDR: blunt force =/= foul play
Hitting the ground after jumping off a roof would result in multiple blunt force injuries. So would stepping into the path of a moving vehicle. I'm not saying it was definitely suicide, just that your disbelief isn't based on anything solid.
Sounds like the old “Russian Suicide” to me. 
I also disagree with that practice which is why I said “not because they’re compensated.”
I forget what show it was that I saw, but how someone lands can depict if it was forced or not.

No one who jumps to kill their self lands really on their face, and that's more of a sign of being thrown off.

Obviously I don't know the details of his death or how he landed but that's something to take into account.
This, incidentally, is how flat-earthers became a thing. Up until the internet when someone believed the earth was flat, they kept it to themselves because they didn't want people to think they were an idiot and ostracised from the group. Once the internet came along all those people who believed the earth was flat could anonymously validate the idea for each other and now it's a movement.

The internet has given us a great many things, validating stupid like-minded ideas is not one of them.
Two different things here. You have many people beyond just law enforcement at play here. I know if I respond on something that looks wonky it would be brought up to a myriad of different people. Ems administration, medical control doctors. There is a report made called an nfir that is publicly available as well as the medical report for the patient. It doesn’t take an ME to think something is up. If it was really that suspicious a lot of people would know about it. 
What exactly is stopping one of those 200 people from going to the FBI?
The only large scale conspiracy that actually works is the secret of Santa Claus, and most people figure that out by age 10 at the latest. 
I think you’re going to need a lot more than 50k, for one thing.
Yeah, I might shut up for that kind of money. Lol but would my friends and family after seeing me and my coworkers get miraculously rich? How do I get that money? Lol it’s not totally impossible but pretty unlikely. You can read the snopes article on his death. There are a million ways to die man. And if you are a super rich company who wants to assassinate someone I think you could afford to make it look like an accident so you wouldn’t need to pay off a huge amount of people.
Maybe the article is deliberately wording it in a weird way, but they specified multiple injuries rather than multiple spots of trauma. If it had been a fall, I'd think it would be 1 injury possibly spread to several areas.
Sure, or maybe they should ensure they are clear with statements like consistent with a fall. I dont trust people when tens of billions are on the line.

That's a lot of power to corrupt people.
What individuals would make those calls to execute someone?  The CEO?  A majority shareholder?
It always blows my mind that people like you will believe anything that you think feels right, while ignoring all contradictory evidence. Oh, wait, no it doesn't, because that exactly how a conspiracy theorist thinks.
I think that's what they're showing though: the price upfront for no insurance. Then sites like goodrx can bring it down for said people. 

It isn't great but at the very least hopefully it will make the public realize certain medicines cost an extreme amount of money. I know many people are aware of this but for instance my parents never look at what an insurance company paid, because they don't have copays. Or they didn't until I started pointing out how ridiculous prices are, even though my copays are $5. I switched from EpiPen to a competitor just because I didn't want my insurance to give them several hundred dollars more. And it still bothers me that my Lyrica 100mg costs as much per pill as a 200mg pill. 
Well there is their contracts with the insurance companies, which have to be renegotiated if they want to do that
i guess what i'm implicating is that that's not what happens with normal products at all. if you can't afford something, you aren't allowed to buy it

insurance can be irritating, but there's a reason it exists

maybe your'e describing a system where everyone, especially the healthy, are mandated to buy one fairly expensive plan so that everyone has equal prices?
Thanks for clarifying! I'll edit my comment. 
The comment you responded to was seeking info on all drugs so your answer was not addressing the question asked.  I tried to look it up and it appeared the US was slightly ahead of other developed nations on prescription drug use but no where even close to using 75% of all pharmaceuticals.  Your response was not only poorly answering the question asked but left a false impression almost the opposite of the correct answer.
The snopes piece is kinda weak though. It doesn't disprove foul play at all and doesn't even give a plausible explanation of how the guy killed himself from blunt force trauma outside his own garage (not on a road, not below a tall building)

If I was committing suicide I feel like I'd want my head to hit first but maybe survival instinct kicks in and stops most people.
Blunt force suicide.
Probably the corruption within the FBI for starters
up it to 500k, still 100m to save potential billions. 
I don't think so. $50k is a life changing amount of money for a police officer and even more so for a paramedic
While I appreciate your point, I have to disagree. Here’s a quick thought experiment to test your assumption: if you were in a car accident and you cut your head open and broke your leg, would the doctors or paramedics refer to that as a single injury spread to multiple places or two separate injuries caused by the same incident? I’d bet on the latter.

Edit word
They are consistent and clear.  That you aren't experienced in the field and don't understand the terminology isn't their fault.

Profit.  This is why it exists.

>maybe your'e describing a system where everyone, especially the healthy, are mandated to buy one fairly expensive plan so that everyone has equal prices?

I'm suggesting that health providers offer services at a clearly advertised and non-negotiable price.  Prices should not be determined by insurance companies.

Insurance companies can sell plans based on varying levels of coverage.

The pharmaceutical industry does shady and illegal things, sure, but usually more the dodgy slight-of-hand variety rather than this nonsensical conspiracy bullshit
Have you read said contracts? No. It might be a 10 year or 20 year contract, especially if it is a medicine just released that won't have a generic made for a decade. 
> People buy things they can't afford all the time. Houses and cars for example.

in order to do that you need to find someone to approve your loan. you can't get approved for a loan for a house they don't think you'll be able to pay back

> Profit. This is why it exists.

No, that's how it is sustained. It *exists* because if Timmy's life-saving operation costs $50,000 we as a society would like Timmy to survive.

> I'm suggesting that health providers offer services at a clearly advertised and non-negotiable price. Prices should not be determined by insurance companies.

> Insurance companies can sell plans based on varying levels of coverage.

Can you explain how this works? A service is sold for $50,000 at Health Provider 1. The same service is sold for $40,000 at Practice 2. Insurance Plan A covers 80% of that service. Insurance Plan B covers 50% of that service. Insurance Plan C agrees to cover $20,000 of that service. Insurance Plan D will cover that service for free, but only once per decade, and covers it at 20% after that.

What price are the Health Providers supposed to give to customers that call and ask?
We're speaking at cross purposes and I suspect its not helping that you're also a bit of an asshole.  I don't dispute Americans use 75% of opioids.  I do dispute the false implication that Americans use 75% of all pharmaceuticals.

I'll break it down:
You said " The U.S is also, EASILY, the biggest consumer of pharmaceutical drugs. No other country comes close."  
  
Someone asked for more information and you replied specifically about opioids.  The class "pharmaceutical drugs" includes opioids but also includes antibiotics, cancer drugs, and every other prescription medicine.  The assertion that Americans use 75% of opioids may be perfectly true but does not support your assertion that "The U.S is also, EASILY, the biggest consumer of pharmaceutical drugs. No other country comes close."

>in order to do that you need to find someone to approve your loan. 

People get medical care without regard to payment.  However they cannot usually discharge this debt via bankruptcy.  So there's no question of credit availability.

>No, that's how it is sustained. It exists because if Timmy's life-saving operation costs $50,000 we as a society would like Timmy to survive.

There's no obligation for anyone to sell insurance.  They only do it to make money.

> What exactly is the advertised price supposed to be here?

That's for the hospital (a business) to decide.  Other fairly complex businesses can do it - so can a healthcare provider.

> People get medical care without regard to payment. However they cannot usually discharge this debt via bankruptcy. So there's no question of credit availability.

They can do this because of insurance. That's all I have to say about that.

>> What exactly is the advertised price supposed to be here?

> That's for the hospital (a business) to decide. Other fairly complex businesses can do it - so can a healthcare provider.

this is exactly why your 'wish' can't work. you wish they could have a standard process where what is advertised is what you pay, but you haven't given a single example of how that would work

anyway, i don't want to be toxic or anything, but i don't know if i can get through to you and from what i can tell what you're saying doesn't really make sense

i guess you're arguing that private health care practices should just cover everyone that doesn't want to pay?
Just to mention,  
   
Thousands of people are dying or have died because a company, Johnson and Johnson, has covered up since 1957 evidence of high rates, 3% of total content, containing asbestos fibers in a product designed for infants to adults but primarily marketed towards infants.   
     
INFANTS.     
   
This is horrendous.  
As someone who uses Talcum powder daily: wow. 
They may be entitled to financial compensation!
Even if it’s just trace amounts of asbestos, it’s pretty messed up that unbeknownst to them; parents are rubbing this on their new born children. Carniogens from day one. 
Is this still a problem? Should I stop using baby powder now?
I just want to make clear that you have a far higher chance of developing lung cancer as opposed to mesothelioma from asbestos exposure. 

The reason mesothelioma is all over those law advertisements is because it’s easier to point to asbestos as the direct cause, as opposed to the numerous causes of lung cancer (smoking obviously). Mesothelioma is so rare compared to lung cancer. 

So there are many more people with lung cancer due to the baby powder that won’t get compensation since they got the “wrong cancer”. 

EDIT: This is a crazy inaccurate title. It’s not 11,000 mesothelioma patients. It’s mostly ovarian cancer with a few mesothelioma patients sprinkled in. My original comment still stands though. 
They put profits over the safety of people, including children. There should be criminal punishment for such reckless behavior.
Mesothelioma is not a cureable cancer btw once you get it you are going to 100% die from it. That is what killed my father.
Im suddenly left wondering if that lady on My Strange Addictions that snorts/eats talcum powder is okay...
Asbestos? Since when is this a thing again? I thought we did away with all the asbestos like 20 years ago. 

Well I do not care for this new Asbestos, and you may quote me on that.
>J&J didn’t tell the FDA that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc – in one case at levels reported as “rather high.”

They probably just forgot. I mean, who hasn't forgotten to take out the same frozen pizza from the oven once, twice or thrice over a period of three years?
How have we not run out of mesothelioma people yet? Those ads have been running since the 80s.
what the hell, ive been putting this stuff on my balls for a long time.. how recently has the asbestos been in it?
I was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma when i was 29. I am 34 now. A year of hell but chemo has let me get  back to a normal life. I tried to sue, 2 lawyers, neither could figure out exactly where my exposure to asbestos came from so they dropped me. It will bother me forever not knowing how i obtained this death sentence 
J&J should cease to exist for this and the executives that were involved jailed but I'm sure the pocket change sized fine they'll get instead will still hurt super bad.
When people uphold the "free market" as a self regulating system, they are right. The "free market" is self regulating, but the only outcome that really matters is profit, it self regulates to maximize that outcome. 

There is also a delusional amount of optimism in the actions of people on the part of some "free market" supporters. They think people are good, not evil, so the overall outcome of a group will be largely good and beneficial. However, look at the Stanford prison experiments. This is what can happen when people let authority, power, and desire for a goal outweighs all other concerns.
From what I’ve read, 1-3 batches tested at 3% and they weren’t released. The spec for  batch release appears to be 0.03%... at least from 1970 or so on. 
If I’m understanding it correctly, that means each batch or “run” was tested and was destroyed if it was over 0.03% contaminated..
... this seems to be an over reaction. 0.03% asbestos by volume is essentially nothing. How are they correlating that quantity with cancer?

Keep in mind, lawyers love this shit too. Especially if it’s a huge company implicated in potential harm to children.. they eat this shit up looking for a pay day. 

I think I’ll wait to see some more actual data before I grab a pitch fork. 
At some point and time J&J did the math and figured it was more profitable to continue to use asbestos with talcum powder.  Their math probably concluded that most people would either be dead or not know it was baby powder that caused an issue.  
  
 Much like how Firestone did the math and figured a few hundred deaths from defective tires was worth it.   
My grandma was a pediatric nurse and died of lung cancer. There’s a significant correlation between pediatric nurses and lung cancer. Fuck these people. 
*If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with mesothelioma you may be entitled to financial compensation.*
People ITT will be pissed when they learn about construction and insulation materials sourced from China...

Edit:

I've been banned for some arbitrary reason...

Tile gets damaged daily.  The amount of asbestos that you are exposed to is virtually unchanged because of Chinese imports.

Chinese imports of pet food only decreased because thousands of pets were sickened/killed.
Its a good thing Trump made it Legal to introduce Asbethos back into products again this year... Like drywall. Yay?
I think Trump is allowing abestos to be legal again. 
If you go for a hike in northern california you're going to inhale asbestos from serpentinite
This makes me so angry.  The original lawsuit would have gone forward in 1999 if Johnson & Johnson had abided by basic discovery rules.  It’s incredibly frustrating to litigate cases when you know a defendant is simply hiding- or refusing to disclose - evidence.  It happens all the time, and judges don’t seem to care.  It’s absolutely maddening.  And makes our civil justice system closer to a sham to support corporate interests over plaintiffs’ rights.  
I need to find a lawyer, my mom died of complications after a double lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was a life long user of baby powder. She’d apply it so liberally that part of cleaning the bathroom was getting every corner covered in powder. 
fun fact, whenyour lung collapses and won't reinflate theu put talcum powder in your chest to get it to stick to the walls.
So there was asbestos in J&J up until 2000? This has me worried. It was used a lot in my childhood..
It's such an unbelievable elephant in the room 
that corporations are greedy scum bags that knowingly commit 
crimes against humanity pretty much across the board yet 
everyone has investments with said companies and these companies are somehow held in high asteam. 
Umm... My mom used talcum powder on me and my siblings We are in our late and early 20s. Should we be worried?

Edit: Why the downvotes? The report says some samples from 2010 were tested for it. What range of this product was affected by this? I actually wanna know if our gen should be worried too?
Is this the same asbestos that trump wanted to unban or a different type of asbestos?
This is giving me so much anxiety. I breathed in some asbestos about 5 years ago and I'm just waiting..
I knew an old guy that was fucking Barbara Johnson while she was freshly married to old man Johnson. He died of lung cancer and didn’t smoke.  JSJ was a motherfucker. 
Well fuck my boots. I use baby powder regularly because I have IBS that causes regular liquid shits. This is insanely awful. 
We'll put no more tears on the bottle

But it does make you cry..

I know, mwahahah!!
I'm never using talcum powder again. 
If companies are people, this one should be executed 
I see a lot of comments saying that they hope the whole company goes under etc. What many people forget is how many drugs Johnson and Johnson manufacture, many of which help saves lives. 
I tried posting about this on r/news months ago, and so did other people, and the articles were all removed. They said the article had been posted, but the article was only 16 hours old when I read it- I went through 2 days of posts and ever saw it. Glad that the story is getting out about this bullshit.
There's an interesting loophole in some asbestos legislation that allows attorneys to file suit on behalf of those exposed to asbestos without even contacting the victims. The attorney then takes their fee and gives the rest of the compensation to the victim. I spoke with an attorney from New York who paid $500,000 for a software developer to develop a program that would find uncompensated asbestos victims just so he can file a claim in their name, take his 1/3, and then compensate the victim. He is mega successful. 

I personally handle some subrogation work myself, but nothing on this level. 
Ok

Can someone please say when they stopped doing it? 

And everyone who says punish the people in charge NOW... if they stopped in the 80's or 90's you're punishing the wrong people... 

The company did something evil, but going after the execs who are there now for the crimes of those before them is seriously stupid and shortsighted. Go after those responsible. 

Edit: and if they are still doing it, go after the assholes
We should burn their factories, ohhh right...
Fuck
I would love to hear Jamie Johnson's opinion on this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Rich_(film)
Good luck getting any decent amount of money out of them after the lawyers take their MASSIVE cut and then everything is divided 11,700 ways.

they will never see a penny of this and the corporation will get a fine and all will be like nothing happened....same thing with the Pinto and Ford and so many other corporate abuse that was dismissed
So now I gotta throw out my baby powder ? I don't want to
How do you know if you were effected, while we’re at this?
But will they be entitled to legal compensation? Hopefully. 
I’ve been slathering this shit on my nutsack for years
What's worse is how many people snorted or smoked it due it being used to cut coke for decades. 
Does this mean I won’t see the commercials anymore?
And Johnson&Johnson won't see 2020 as a company
In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled.  There wasn't even a statement on talcum powder and asbestos till 1976.  
  
There's a mine somewhere where asbestos and talc occur together naturally.  The mining industry being the mining industry...
theres a sinking ship.


Normal fucking country
Ford Pinto take two? 
Just wondering - is this an argument *for* the ability of a large group of people to keep a secret? The article implies that a large number of people knew about the positive tests in the 70s, and it's only coming out now?
I know lawyers. They’re pieces of shit. I know reporters. They’re not data scientists. I also know business men. They cover stuff up sometimes. 

But most importantly... I know how trials work. Data is irrelevant if you can convince juries, via any method possible, that these people were affected. This can happen at the very last second of a trial... shit can go sideways in a second and it all depends on how manipulative (ie. good) the lawyer is.

None of you know shit. Don’t pretend that you do. Lower those goddamn pitch forms and get informed. This is how innocent people got lynched back in the day or how multitudes of people got hurt without any justice being served.
Oh no. That is *terrible*. Such an obvious thing to fix instead of cover up.
“If you or a loved one....”
I wonder how much or how long you would have had to use it ? Years ? a few times a month?
Corn starch is the solution. Buy a Gold Bond applicator, empty it and half fill it with corn starch. Completely edible and cheap.
How do people find out about this stuff?
My parents used to use this on me as a baby, how much health risk do I have?
If profits aren't going to be severly impacted, then the majority of shareholders won't care. I hope the justice system has enough of a backbone to go after these sociopaths. 
Dont worry itll be ok. They will issue a public apology and fire the CEO, as per usual nowadays. After that they will rebrand themselves as the new and improved Johnson & Johnson, so people will forgive them...only to be shocked when something like this inevitably pops up again in the future. 
Sorry I’m genuinely curious how the product wasn’t tested by the public or an independent lab to verify 3% asbestos in over 50 years? Asbestos testing is easy and common. This should have been verified decades ago and known by everyone. 
3%? That's not enough. [We demand more asbestos!](https://youtu.be/ykm3GI1oTnQ)
for your ass hole too, they haven't been putting it in powder for foot rash, no it's mainly used for babies assholes
But Trump said that fears around asbestos were actually just part of a big mob conspiracy... 🤔
Got a source for that claim?
These kinds of historical trends are why you'll never convince me real free market capitalism is the final economic answer. Capitalism is the by far the best self-sustaining economy we can correlate with marked increases in QOL, but the stance that the free market will *always* solve these kinds of problems just doesn't seem tenable. 

In the past, there were 'ground level' impacts on a company's bottom line consumers could rally by not purchasing a product line or something. Whether or not we all collectively stop buying J&J would be (1) too little too late (2) near impossible to be impactful with the way vertical integration has successfully killed off most small margin competitors. 


Those who knew should be charged with murder and locked away for the rest of their lives. They won't sniff a day in prison, though.
Sure they may have cancer now, but did any of those babies *even once* catch on fire? Give credit where credit is due!
And Black and Hispanic women.
J&J is owner by Pfizer. Does anyone have a list of Pfizer companies? I'm having a hard time finding one online.
Yeah, this is arguably worse than the whole ordeal with cigarettes given the typical age of the user. 
Poisoning and killing possibly millions of babies? Sounds like a good use of the death penalty 
“A family company”
“Johnson & Johnson: a ‘family’ company” 🙄
Yeah, unfortunately I have a lot of family overseas that use talcum powder on a daily basis too, they’re absolutely horrified to hear this. 
My parents still use it, and now my mum is upset because she used it on my brothers and I when we were babies, and she had no idea it was dangerous
Wait they *still* use talc for baby powder? I thought everyone had converted over to cornstarch decades ago!
It’s been known for awhile that women who use baby powder on their inner thighs and general nether regions are at much higher risk for developing cervical cancer. If you’re a guy who regularly uses baby powder in the same areas, I’d think twice about having sex with you. 
Should probably switch to flour. 
I work in a factory that makes drywall and we use tons of talc powder on the boards to help them run along the machine smoother without damaging the board. That shit ends up all over the fucking place...
Maybe find another solution to whatever problem Talcum powder is solving for you, for now.
Don’t know what country you’re in but in the US, baby powder is mostly “zeas mays” or cornstarch

3% is way way way too much.

Especially since there's no safe level of asbestos exposure. Just a little bit can be dangerous. 
J&J, and a lot of other companies, already make Talcum-free baby powder. It’s made from cornstarch and is safe to use. 
Switch to the corn starch based powder. It’s more sustainable anyway.
> The reason mesothelioma is all over those law advertisements is because it’s easier to point to asbestos as the direct cause

Isn't mesothelioma ONLY caused by asbestos inhalation and thus the diagnosis guarantees asbestos exposure?
[deleted]
Yeah that'll totally happen
Oh there will be. They're gonna have to pay maybe millions of dollars. So, some numbers move digitally on a screen somewhere. Ju$tice served.
No. Johnson and Johnson is a family company.
I just lost my brother this Wednesday from mesothelioma. He was 29 and it was just about to be the 1 year anniversary of his diagnosis. I'm sorry for your loss.
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve only ever seen a case of Mesothelioma once in medical school, and I’ll never forget seeing how much pain that patient was in. This cancer is completely preventable, there is no reason for us to keep using asbestos in anything after knowing about its dangers. 
Even without the asbestos, I’d say probably not 
I love where your mind went... prayers for Talc Lady.
Asbestos is routinely being found in Talc, since Talc and Asbestos are often found in the same mines. The talc is processed into a powder form, and easily inhaled by people who use it every day.
So while we don’t use it in construction anymore, people are getting Asbestos in their lungs through freaking baby powder, of all things. 
Asbestos is a type of mineral. If you mine something like talc, you may get asbestos with it.
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-epa-allowing-asbestos-products/

Our president also thinks asbestos is harmless and was only deemed harmful because of the construction lobby. He claims that the WTC towers would not have fallen if they were using asbestos. The WTC did have a good amount of asbestos.

https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/08/trump-thinks-that-asbestos-would-have-stopped-the.html
Trump changed an epa policy from banning asbestos to allowing it to be used in a case by case basis  
It's about to make a big comeback.  Trump's EPA is deregulating asbestos.  I fucking hate the republican party.

[‘Approved by Donald Trump’: Asbestos sold by Russian company is branded with the president’s face](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/11/approved-by-donald-trump-asbestos-sold-by-russian-company-is-branded-with-the-presidents-face/)
One of J&Js arguments is that all the big asbestos players from the 70s and 80s have been litigated to death, so now plaintiffs firms are going after talc powder companies, like J&J and Cashmere Bouqeut.
/r/unexpectedmulaney
I thought so too but they just tore up an entire park at an elementary school near me in a suburb of Boston and it was for asbestos.
Are you referencing Parks & Rec?
/r/unexpectedmulaney
Talc and asbestos are cooccurring minerals in the same group. It's difficult to get one without the other.
Donald Trump actually wants to cut back on Asbestos regulations in the US. In 2017, there were only 2 countries that still mined Asbestos. Brazil, and Russia. Brazil actually had a law go into effect banning it months ago, so that just leaves Russia. He doesn't want the US to start mining again. He just wants the US to be able to purchase it again for things other than Chlorine filtration (its only current legal use) because that would help out our new pals in Russia. IIRC there's a recent photo out there of pallets of Asbestos with Trump's face printed out and taped to the side of them.
>"Well I do not care for this new Asbestos"

>u/tezoatlipoca 2018

Just exercising my right
>  Since when is this a thing again?

This story is about baby powder from 1972-1975. It's not a current contamination.
It was in use for a long time (and still is in some countries) and in a lot of different applications.  Even if it has been banned, it's still around.  For example, those of us who grew up in homes or went to schools built pre-ban in the US may have been exposed to asbestos fibers used in things like textured paint.  We won't know for another couple of decades if we have just the wrong combination of exposure and genetic susceptibility to develop mesothelioma.
It can take up to 50 years for onset of symptoms.
Probably since the last time you put it in your balls.
It’s just part of the costs of doing business, that’s all
[deleted]
> I think I’ll wait to see some more actual data before I grab a pitch fork. 

For the Mesothelioma cases, they plaintiffs would have to prove that the Talc was the sole contributor.  The juries have been split on this that the talc caused this.  Didn't read the cases, so not sure why some said yes and some said no.  

The question is the link to ovarian cancer.  Here again, the juries have been split.  This is a tough hill to climb since there doesn't seem to be definitive data linking the two (iaw - smoking is linked to about 80-90% of lung cancer death.  If you smoke, your are 15-30 times more likely to die of lung cancer)   If talc was a primary cause of ovarian cancer then the data should show a high number of lifetime talc users with ovarian cancer.  

  


Most reasonable post here gets almost no attention.
Anything over 1% asbestos is considered ACM or asbestos containing material. So yeah 0.03% is really nothing. 
11,000+ people is a lot, don’t get me wrong, but it’s fair to say that nearly everyone in the world (at least developed world) has been exposed to baby power 100’s of times in their lives. So 11,000 / billions??  That means 1:100,000 people, maybe. That seems hard to prove and also seems hard to even find in a study. If they did a clinical trial with 50,000 people (an impossible number to actually do a prospective study with) it’s likely they wouldn’t find a single case. 
Asbestos is in plenty of products. It’s only dangerous when it becomes friable. They should stop using it but they argue that under normal use it’s not dangerous (this is referring to construction products like tile paste and concrete, not baby powder.) 

The issue is when it isn’t used normally or when it breaks.

Make Asbestos Great Again
I mean isn’t asbestos a pretty big deal for Russia? 
So is California known to the state of California to cause cancer?
As long as you aren't chiseling it you should be fine
In Europe they might, but in the US they avoid the Talc Powder Aerosol Method and instead create abrasions on the parietal pleural surface to increase its grip and get it to stick to the walls. 
Why not peanut butter?
The company shouldn’t go under. The people directly related to this cover up should go to jail, and the company - insured for these incidents - should pay big time. 

Then the company should be run by transparent leaders with transparent practices. 
All the thousands of scientists and engineers that work for them aren't suddenly disappearing just because the company goes under, they can do their work at a slightly less reprehensible company. 

As for the drugs, they can also be manufactured elsewhere.

His name? Saul Goodman. 
Talcum powder from any company is at high risk of contamination by asbestos. It is not that Johnson & Johnson is the only company that makes talcum powder, it’s just BY FAR the largest company that does. The problem isn’t ignorance; rather, it is that the company KNEW about asbestos contamination in their products, and specifically HID that information from federal regulators so that they could avoid scrutiny and continue to sell potentially contaminated product and make money. 
Mesothelioma: deal with it asbestos you can 
This is one of the scariest aspects of it: Mesothelioma doesn’t necessarily manifest until decades after asbestos exposure. So you really have no way of knowing right now.
Enough to be breathing it in regularly
You should get screened often tbh. As a baby you are much more prone to have things go wrong with you. 
If there was ever a case to have a death penalty for companies, this would be it. 
Well the stock has plunged 9 percent so far today 
Exactly. Unless the amount Johnson and Johnson has to pay is a huge percentage of their profits, they'll just do it again knowing that they can spend half a century poising children and still make a profit 
There should be excessive jail time and the complete dismantling of the company imo
Do the American people have a backbone?  Those in the Justice system will continue to look at risks and benefits.  Serving the wealthy produces the greatest benefits with minimal risk - as long as the public continues to do basically nothing, insuring that there are very limited repercussions.
It should affect shareholders. I don't see how anyone can trust their products anymore. 
It's a half trillion dollar company with $20B in annual sales, a record high share price and double digit annual growth for like 20 years or something ridiculous. The grandson of the founder is currently the ambassador to the UK.

They're not going anywhere. 
You have to think they wanted to keep this under wraps until after Obama was out of office. Time and time again we've seen this administration do the wrong thing and I'm not expecting this to be any different. From the judges Trump has appointed to the agencies he has gutted, GE couldn't have asked for a better time for this news to come out. Well, maybe 2017 would have been better.
I think profits will be severly impacted by this, I know that I won't be buying talc and will be avoiding Johnson & Johnson's products from now on. I'll also be telling people I know about this and to avoid their products.
I agree, but want to state the obvious. The people from the 50's are not running the company today. The people in charge need to be clued into the issues. There is a very good chance that they simply didn't know that it was a problem since it has been status quo for so long. I work for a large corp and I can't think of these things, I don't have enough time to fish for these types of issues. I've found a few over the years, but it's rarely apparent until it's already a lawsuit and I'm collecting the discovery data. The bad decisions were made years ago. It's not like they even had SharePoint or Confluence back then and they were marking requirements and risks. I hate how people assume that corporations are evil versus them simply being made up of people being overworked and trying thier best. It's just like a restaurant. I am struggling to fulfill everyone's orders and I know that there are lots of issues.  I assure you the I'm trying my best with the available resources.

EDIT: I have requested more employees for the past three years, but got denied. With that regard corporations have failed me because I told then that we were overburdened and needed more heads. I bet the people making the product in question had similar issues. The thing is, I think the CEO would react positively if the issue ever got to them. But, corporate governance doesn't make this feasible. I've even sat in a room with them and still was forbade from requesting more resources. The whole corporate system causes these issues. It's like early aviation in Japan, when the co-pilot was being dishonorable by telling the pilot that they were making an error.
Im pretty sure JJ is a family company
Your in the wrong country friend.
I think this is a rare case of the Justice System being strong enough to really hurt a masisve company like J&J. Mesothelioma is so profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if most people here still remember that commercial from the 90s. And there are hoards of lawyers out there who likely specialize solely in Mesothelioma lawsuits even today.

I wish I could say that J&J will pay due to the fact they deserve it and not because of greedy lawyers salivating over the prize money but this is how the world works and as long as J&J pays, then I'll chalk it up to a win.
The justice system is brought to you in part by, you guessed it, these types of companies. Capitalism is working out *great* the way we’re doing it now, yup. Any deviation is communism or fascism. Yup. /s
All because we live in a society run by people that prioritize profit over humanity, and we have a justice system that empowers their depraved insanity for ever increasing profit margins. 
And the fired CEO gets 5 million dollars as severance, and they get immediately rehired by another multi-million dollar company, and continue to make more a year than some do in decades, or even their whole lives.
They won’t even fire the ceo 
Maybe someone more familiar with the approval process for OTC's and things like talcum powder can chime in.

But I think back in the 50's, government regulation of this stuff was rare.  It wasn't until later that the FDA stepped in and started requiring companies to show that their product was safe.  Naturally, they granted exceptions for products which were GRAS or Generally Recognized As Safe.  Things which had been widely used for a long time and had no known problems.  I would bet talcum powder was GRAS and so was granted an exception.

Edit - Apparently the FDA doesn't test cosmetics (which talcum powder is) unless there is scientific evidence that it might be harmful.  So the opposite of what they do for foods.
Hi, lab analyst here.

As it turns out, there's *all kinds* of consumer products that don't really get tested, especially topicals.

Also, since it's always worth saying: "Organic" doesn't mean "pesticide-free."
Asbestos lawyer here . . .

One of the problems with talc in particular is that you need a really, really powerful microscope to see the asbestos fibers in it, as they tend to be smaller than most asbestos fibers you find in other kinds of products.

Of course, Johnson and Johnson *knew* about this fact decades ago.  Yet they still, to this day, squawk about EPA testing that used insufficiently powerful microscopes.

They also defend their lawsuits by saying the asbestos in their talc isn't *really* asbestos, it's just "cleavage fragments."

Why would you think to test for asbestos? Or lead? Or arsenic? Or...? Ok. You want to test EVERYTHING for EVERYTHING. Very safe! 

....now, who’s *paying* for all that testing? And spot testing over time for everything again, to ensure it stays safe? 

The government? We don’t pay nearly enough in taxes to find that kind of extensive, thorough testing for everything on everything.  They manage risk vs cost by defining higher risk categories — if we consume it, if it’s medicine, if it’s an inherently risky product or service — and spot inspect or check as frequently and for what is pertinent to that product. 

Us? You’ll really pay THAT much more for extensively individually tested products? Lol. Go on, pull the other leg. As mass consumers we chase the cheapest prices and the nicest-sounding catch phrases and most magical promises (. Think about junk products like homeopathic “remedies”, “quick and easy!”  weight loss pills, potions, and wraps, and and sold-by-your-stylist baldness cures. Not to mention the rise of WalMart. Crappy service and lower quality, but... it’s cheaper!

I think the point of the article is that tests have been done, but Johnson and Johnson have silenced the results. 
It was tested and results were covered up and fabricated. 
People have known for years but everyone calls them conspiracy nuts
If I'm paying for asbestos, I at least want my money's worth!
Truth be told, I can't think of a better way they could have prepared us for the real world than blowing asbestos up our ass.
It’s not dangerous unless it becomes airborne and people are around to breath it.  Wait...
That's because Russia is by far the world's largest producer of asbestos. 

>Russia: 1,050,000 metric tons.

>China: 420,000 metric tons.

>Brazil: 307,000 metric tons.

>Kazakhstan: 242,000 metric tons.

>India: 240 metric tons.
I'm guessing he won't be able to give you one because there isn't one. The talc-asbestos-cancer question has been studied for decades - it is only suddenly in the news now (and with huge lawsuits) due to a rather overblown ovarian cancer study some years ago.

The evidence is looking fairly strong that talc-based cosmetics do not correlate with ovarian cancer risk, but the connection with mesothelioma is not as well studied. Existing data does not support a link, but it's still a matter of debate, and better studies will be coming in the future. Below is a paper discussing the current status of the scientific debate.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08958378.2018.1438540
For what? What’s a daily use for that stuff?
Not only was it used on me as a baby back in the 70s, a few of my dolls actually came with little bottles of the powder. 

So, that's awesome. 
I ran around our house playing "steam engine" with a bottle of the stuff when I was a kid. The entire upstairs floor ended up being coated in white.

Glad I haven't continued to play steam engine as an adult.
Cornstarch is literally food for all kinds of disgusting organisms. 
I have a newborn and use none of these, am I doing it wrong?
What the hell? Who does that?
Is the cancer causing stuff still used?! Wtf. 
Makes it a lot easier to find the wet spot.

*baby powder falls from sky*
My decent settlement was tax free
I don't know, I got $20 from the Aveeno class action suit and that wasn't cancer. They're also owned by J&J. No proof of purchase required (yes I did buy the stuff).
I prefer a 1% alternative brand.
How do you think I survived a poison attempt using Iocaine powder?!?!
Why is there a need for baby powder? 

I'm not well informed in baby stuff. 
I wouldn’t buy anything made by a company who has been wilfully poisoning people for half a century in pursuit of profit on a balance sheet no matter what they were selling. We’re told corporations are people; Johnson & Johnson deserve the death penalty.
Burt's Bees makes a good one. It smells like honey. I used it on my babies.
What about gold bond powder? Does it have asbestos?
The majority of [cases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741803/) are from exposure (80% according to that study), but there are other factors.  


It’s dangerous to use the words “only” and “always” in medicine. But for lawsuit purposes, yeah mesothelioma=asbestos exposure. 
Future mesothelioma cases might come from the researchers studying carbon-nano-tubes (CNTs) as a "miracle material" over the past 10 years.

CNTs have the same "spear-like" dimensions as asbestos and are equally un-degradable by the immune system.  The dimensions of asbestos let them reach the distal lung and are implicated as a cause of the abnormal cell response.

[source](https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/articles/are-carbon-nanotubes-a-new-asbestos-298901)
According to Citizens United, corporations have the same rights as people. Therefore, shouldn’t they have the same responsibilities?

Over 10k cases of murder 2?  Why not the death penalty for the corporation?   Wind it down, sell its assets and let it disappear into the long goodnight.  
It will happen to some poor lamb they send to the slaughter but the lead execs will be fine. 
What makes you think Mueller won't go for them next?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I wish it weren't so soon after your brother passed but would you mind clarifying something?  My impression was that mesothelioma only affected older people who had been exposed to asbestos over a long period and in sizable amounts.  I'm sure this makes you feel uncomfortable but do you know how someone so young developed it?
I am sorry for your loss 29 is way to young to have passed from that.

>So while we don’t use it in construction anymore

Asbestos is not banned, it's use is regulated but it's still being used.


Just thinking of Kevin Garnett throwing talcum powder in the air before every game ... Smh 
I have been suspicious about baby powder since forever... Powders are almost always unsafe when inhaled unless they are water soluble. 
> in their lungs

And in their ovaries.
I find asbestos in most buildings I analyze
It's 6 different minerals, actually.
"Syphilis is harmless! I've had it for thirty years and frankly, I've got the biggest lymph nodes, I'm telling you, biggest you've ever seen."
Coincidentally, by far the worlds largest producer of asbestos [is Russia.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264923/world-mine-production-of-asbestos/)
More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Construction lobby *and* the mob.
Yep, Trump has long been pro asbestos. Constantly praising it and claiming dangers were faked by the mob. 

He even claimed everything would have been okay on 9/11 if there was more asbestos in the buildings.
This anti science bullshit happens EVERY republican administration. You want the US to be a safe and healthy place to live. Do not vote republican.
Oh _right_. Opening Arguments podcast had a segment on it. 

Yeah, total stupid cakes.
What the fuck? I know treason and all but wow
The reason there is such ripe pickings for litigation is the regulation is so lax. Far better for society if regulation had prevented the harm in the first place. Then there'd be no lawsuits.
There are a lot of homes that have asbestos floors in the basement.  It sort of looks like thick linoleum squares.  The advice given is it’s ok as long as you don’t tear it up or disturb it and release fibers into the air.  If you want it removed you have to hire professionals to do the job.  

Back in the 70’s a whole bunch of inexperienced people were hired and given rushed training on asbestos removal.  Unfortunately, they sometimes botched jobs and made the situations worse than if the homeowner did nothing.   I wonder how many of those workers have ill health as a result.


There was big money in asbestos removal as it was banned from schools and public buildings which is why the shoddy contractors got involved.  Today, if your basement is made of this material you either lay a sub floor on top and cover it with another material or you just let sleeping dogs lie and live with it as is.  

Let me see....pay $10,000 for removal or $3000 to cover it up or $0 and you pretend it isn’t as ugly as it truly is.  It’s very ugly aesthetically.
So yeah, asbestos is still around.  
Probably since the first all the way to the last :l
it's been months now and i don't feel any cancer so i guess im fine.
It's true. ~12,000 plus what knows how many more lives will equate to a relatively small fine they'll just shake off 
The people responsible should be thrown in jail. The company is fine.
It would be their employer's fault for doing illegal, immoral shit that they'd lose their jobs. 
They do not employ millions of people. Come on.
It's sad but also hilarious that we let juries of randomly selected dipshits literally vote on how valid science is.

I'm reminded of those geologists in Italy who got jailed for failing to predict an earthquake.

If the incidence is so low that a causal relationship would be impossible to prove, then why is there even a case at all? This is where we're headed as a society, I guess. This thread is mostly hysterical idiots pledging bloody revenge over what appears to be nothing.

&#x200B;
There are not that many cases of Meso a year in the US (about 3k), and you are probably going to find a lot of them are old white men and it is due to their occupation decades ago (Meso has about a 40 year latency period).  

These are people with ovarian cancer.  (22k a year).  
They’re one of the largest exporters of the stuff.
Honestly, they should just put up the sign at all the roads coming in and at the ports and be done with it. 
You must have missed the prop 65 warning on the way in. 
thats not what they told me before they were about to do it to me, bht that was 8  years ago so maybe thats changed.
Some people are allergic. 
> What’s to stop companies from going under the table and getting some lawyers to do this?

What tells you that this hasn't already happened and is just the way of things?
Companies arent people now that someone has to be held accountable. 
There is a death penalty for companies, it just hasn't been used in a long time. Courts have powers to force liquidation if the correct requirements are met, and the government can straight up dissolve any company they want with very few restrictions. 

Last time it was done to any significant degree was under FDR. We really need a new series of trust busts to take out negligent at best and damn evil at worst megacorporations. 


I would add Bhopal gas tragedy to this 
[China had the right idea back in 2009.](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/world/asia/23milk.html) But that is unlikely to happen here in the US. The most they will probably get is a laughably small fine. Which is chump change compared to the amount of money they made selling poison to people. 
Send them to the talc chamber! 
The best we can hope for is the death penalty for those who run it. At least under our current system. 
Let's try 90%
*half a century
I'm sorry but this won't happen. If anything, the top brass will end up getting fat bonusses. They probably don't even think they did anything wrong, let alone feel any kind of guilt, remorse, or basic human emotions.
There should be the people responsible at the top of the company literally being taken out in front of a firing squad, but that would require the justice system actually doing their jobs equitably.
That's the main problem. The people are too passive. But it isn't entirely their fault. The system was made to keep the people from protesting and standing up against the powers that be. The people are also kept ignorant of the true issues in society, and the mainstream media brainwashes them into absorbing massive amounts of propaganda to keep them at peace. This is done so they are distracted from what the elite is doing. 
Exactly. Something needs to change
They might, but it will come with a multimillion dollar severance package.
Australian government tests nothing unless there's suspicions. A competitor might have something tested privately. There's a magazine that does some random testing of stuff, but other than that there's not a lot of quality control. 
Nicotine is an organic pesticide. 
Or that it’s healthy, either. Poison ivy is typically organic and all natural....

>Why would you think to test for asbestos?

I don't know... maybe because talc is often naturally found near asbestos in the earth, the talc can easily become contaminated by the toxin while being mined. 
Does that provide any kind of fire immunity?
Best comment yet! Take your updoot good sir.
Kazakhstan number on producer of potassium. 
I thought canada was up there somewhere?

Because I think there is a town in Quebec  literally called asbestos. 
Russia and China are the two largest producers of aluminium by far as well.
What is asbestos even used for? 
swamp ass
India’s hot as hell, so the talcum powder helps absorb sweat and blocks body odor. 
It helps with chaffing 
Keeps my nether bits dry and, to some extent, fresher smelling.

I use it pretty regularly (maybe couple times a week) as a grown man. 
“Sorry, the other talc”
And talc literally causes cancer. 

And apparently, because that's not enough, it's full of asbestos too.
Strictly speaking, you yourself are also food for all kinds of disgusting organisms. 


You just can’t forget to salt and brine yourself afterwards!
Like what
I was told in my new parent class not to bother with the stuff. It's called "baby powder" but it's not really for babies. Glad I listened to them.
It's absolutely unnecessary. If you have a good butt cream you're fine. 
Nah, man, fine particulates are shitty for their lungs.
You're not supposed to use them at all. The babies inhale it and it's bad. 
A lot of folk use cornstarch as a talc alternative for dryness and the easing of rashes with babies.
Don’t. Use. Talcum powder. We were gifted some when our first kid was born and *never* used it. My mom used it for years and had a hysterectomy due to ovarian cancer at the age of 45. Just Google it. All you need to prevent diaper rash is to dry off the baby’s butt with a *towel* before you put the new diaper on, and change them more often. Boudreaux’s butt paste for treating diaper rash is the goddamned bomb. Baby powder is not necessary. Our kids are now 10 and 5 years old and have never had baby powder used on them. 
That's what she said
How about illegal parking on the highway?
Jim's podcast was the first time I heard about the baby powder scandal a few months back.
The fine powder has two purposes: First, it helps keep the skin dry, which is important when babies wet themselves.  Second, it acts as a dry lubricant to allow the edges of the diaper to slide over the skin without rubbing much - otherwise the diaper would chafe and irritate the skin quite badly over time.
Say you have a kilo of coke and you want to make 2 kilos of sellable product..
Diaper rash.
Adults also use it. For example, if I let moisture sit under my boobs, like if I get sweaty at work, it can cause an infection and serious skin irritation.
Not really. We never even considered it for two kids, and it wasn’t because of the risk of cancer, we just never saw a need. The few times they had diaper rashes, there are creams you can use that work almost immediately. 
There's also one that's made out of powdered coconut or some shit. Also smells delicious.
Mine lists talc as an inactive ingredient. If talc contains asbestos then the answer is yes. Unless modern talc products have found a way to eliminate traces of asbestos from talc I’d assume there’s some in there. Maybe someone more informed can elaborate.
The 80% figure comes from a much older study: http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/9/9/1932.full.pdf

And importantly, that study only looked at known occupational exposure. There are many other contexts in which a person could be exposed to asbestos from natural or man-made sources, and these are actually becoming relatively more common as occupational exposure has been getting more rare.
Who knows that 20% might be from baby formula
Very true, and as the comment said below, the statement is inherently false. I thought that mesothelioma was specifically "a type of lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure" rather than primarily caused...
When I was studying engineering, I took a class on materials.  We discussed CNTs one day, and my peers were gushing over all of the possible applications.  I suggested that it would be prudent for companies to do extensive research into the biological effects *before* using them widely and compared them to asbestos, which was the "magic mineral" of its day.  I was promptly called "anti-progress."

Silly me thinking we should learn from our past mistakes.
Funny how for all intents and purposes they're people up until that means they must face the same punishment as people. 
Thats not scary.  Clawing back dividends is what we need.  The shareholders need to feel the pinch.  Stock goes to zero AND you have to regurgitate ever dividend check you ever got as a shareholder 

Being highly ethical would become the number one ceo qualification overnight.  You'd see divinity degrees in the boardroom.
You know Mueller isn't a superhero crime-fighter, right? Once his job as special counsel investigating the 2016 election is done, he's gone. The Justice Dept provides oversight of his investigation, but Mueller is not part of them.
We're actually not sure how he developed it. We were thinking it was from my mom's pottery (the bisque can contain asbestos. It could also be from when my mom's college was doing asbestos removal. He was a toddler at that time. The youngest case his surgeon had seen was 13 years old. 
And the Cheeto in Chief wants to end even that...
Yeah Reggie Miller too before every free throw. 
Yup, but older buildings I’m guessing, not new constructions. 
More than 6. We only identify the 6 most common forms in a lab setting
That's such a coincidental coinidence.
Problem is that if we fine them too much, they will fail and think about how many jobs that will kill.  We must then give them a bailout, possibly nationalize them, and their CEOs will have to receive massive taxpayer funded bonuses as part of their severance package.  That’s the American way.
One asbestos company put President Trump's face on their product.

Yeah, that’s kinda my fear. This seems crazy!
Correct companies are people when it benefits them and they are not people when the roles swap.
I would think every CEO knew this information over the years from 1957. I think the government should put all the former and the current CEO in prison for doing nothing and keeping it a secret. Also, to pay millions of dollars towards the families affected.
More specifically, court’s order liquidation all the time. It’s a very, very common thing. You just don’t read about it because it’s not very juicy journalism. 
The bopal has tragedy is like if someone fell asleep at the wheel and accidentally drove their car into a crowd of people. This is more like someone committing numerous hit and runs over decades. 
This is why you have to eat your rich.

At least a dozen people knew about this and yet not one of them valued saving babies over their own pockets. They killed an unknowable amount of babies, children, adolescents, adults, and elderly people. Not one of them has a conscience.
Well, even if they deserve it, that’s not how corporations work. The definition of a limited liability company, or LLC is that the person is not responsible for the potentially massive liability of the company. The company is. The problem is when we don’t hold the company liable for truly heinous actions by revoking their business charter. 
Here's a list of all their name brands. https://m.ranker.com/list/johnson-and-johnson-brands/werner-brandes

i'm pretty sure most of the people who made this decision don't work for the company anymore... the people in charge now (i assume, can't find a date when this stopped) would be innocent.
Nicotine in typical doses is not much worse than caffeine (also a plant defense). It's the tar, combustion compounds, and elements/chemicals absorbed by the tobacco plant that are the problem. 
Organic *and* vegan.
I love that photo of a sandwich board outside some business that reads "SOME THINGS THAT ARE GLUTEN FREE: LEAD. COCAINE. URANIUM"
Good guy Johnson & Johnson making babies fireproof. 
I would guess Canada stopped producing asbestos when the entire fucking first world started banning it. Most of the stuff being produced now is being sent to third world countries in Africa and Asia.

Edit: 

>Canada led world production of asbestos before the country's two largest mines (both in Quebec) halted operations in 2012
It’s usually added to building materials and textiles to make them more resistant to fire and heat.
All that does is make fairy paste
I had to quit drinking all forms of caffeine to get rid of mine. I’d almost prefer being dead. 
Huh. TIL.
You can also rub it into your hair to absorb the grease and act as a sort of dry shampoo
I know a number of musky stank ass people who believe that. Talcum powder is not a replacement for deodorant.
I don't know if most people do this, but my grandpa uses talcum powder on his carrom board.
Tips town: they're not using enough if it's to block odor 
Does asbestos cause testicular cancer?

Boudreaux's Butt Paste is the best, if only for it's name.

I just checked mine. It's gold bond 100% talc free corn starch. Scared me at first though. 
Fuuuck. My grandma died of uterine cancer and my mom had to get a hysterectomy, and I'm assuming that was based on genetics. But I used talcum powder as a teenager and loved to smell it. Fuck me. Why do I keep coming to Reddit, it just depresses me.
Just a fire code violation of blocking an exit
Even before this there was debate over the benefits of baby powder, e.g. [https://www.verywellfamily.com/is-baby-powder-safe-for-babies-4064708](https://www.verywellfamily.com/is-baby-powder-safe-for-babies-4064708)
Wow, I wonder how many blow enthusiasts developed lung cancer from talcum cut coke
mmmm, asbestos up your nose 
use one of the many creams available tho....?
Be careful if you do get an infection under the breast. It is usually a yeast infection (little bits of yeast just end up everywhere!) and cornstarch is food for it. Your doctor can prescribe a cream or powder to clear it right up.
Talc and asbestos form under similar conditions. Separating them would be like separating needles from a needlestack
Given the churches reputation these days, maybe a more ethical or honorable degree would be appropriate

Individualize the profits, socialize the costs

Yeah, but they tend to be bankrupt companies that got in trouble for insolvent trading. 
the better analogy would be that bohpal is like knowing you have a driver that falls asleep at the wheel, and then still let him drive, and then act like it wasn't your fault he ran over a crowd of people.  you also then have to do everything you can not to help the people that remain.  
And that's the problem. The consumer has next to no say in a corporations policies. They could literally be killing babies and using their bones as talcum powder, but if the majority of shareholdera are ok with it and the Justice system gives them a slap on the wrist, they'll keep doing fucked up shit. They take calculated decisions when doing fucked up shit. What would get them more profit? Cleaning up their production line and avoid fines, lawsuits + bad PR... OR knowingly continuing poisining their consumers and accepting the future fines, lawsuits and bad PR? Morality is completely absent from these corporations. They simply do not act in the best interest of the consumer or of humanity. They are completely disconnected from the real world. All they see are gains and losses. They no longer posses any humanity, and if they ever pretend to, it's just PR. This is the world we live in folks.
This is why socialists say thing like there isn't ethical consumption under capitalism. So much product is controlled by so few corporations effective boycotting is nigh impossible. "Voting with your wallet" is the greatest lie the corporate class has ever sold, these practices can only be changed with top-down legislation.
Just look at the number of everyday items on the list that you're likely to find in many households. This is an abbreviated list of just the ones I knew:

That's a list a lot of people will have trouble boycotting for pragmatic reasons.

Is Coach really owned by Johnson and Johnson? Wikipedia says Coach is owned by Tapestry Inc, and neither article has any mention of Johnson and Johnson.
Nicotine's usefulness as a stimulant is hindered by its potency(much easier to accidentally be poisoned), its cardiovascular/angiogenic side effects, its short duration of effect, and its withdrawal effects.

And of course, combustion byproducts from smoking have nothing to do with the fact that nicotine is used as an "organic certified" pesticide.
Absolutely. And not to say caffeine isn’t bad for you either, but it’s about perception. I’d imagine many people who only eat organic wouldn’t encourage nicotine being sprayed on their foods. 
The dose makes the poison.
How many babies does it take to test that theory?

No but if you use both it's quite nice. 
Well now you tell me...
Is that what the kids are calling it these days?
No, asbestos is physically carcenogenic, not chemically. The reason it causes mesothelioma is that it's shaped like a very fine needle and it gets stuck in your lung tissue causing irritation that can progress to cancer.
The asbestos is on top of the existing cancer risk.
Part of the problem answering that is that talc and asbestos are commonly found in the same geologic formations; therefore it's hard to differentiate statistically without long term studies and we frown on human testing for that kind of thing.
Strictly speaking, we were all once orgasms.
Cornstarch is also great at growing things like yeast. So, use with caution. I’m a 35 year old woman who doesn’t use powders at all, and never really understood why you even want them to begin with. Yeah, I sweat, and sometimes “diaper rash” happens (especially on my period), but daily use of something you can easily breathe in? No thanks. 
But... I was never harassed while using the easement.
I think those are for rash recovery though, to help the skin heal after damage.  Baby powder, I believe, is to prevent the damage from occuring.


Thanks for the tip!

>Previously, only asbestos can well perform in temperature gloves such as for foundries, aluminum extrusion, and metal treatment, while PBI trials have been developed and show adequately functions as asbestos. Moreover, a safety garment manufacturer reported that gloves containing PBI outlasted asbestos two to nine times with an effective cost.[27] Gloves containing PBI fibers are softer and more supple than those made of asbestos, offering, the worker greater mobility, and comfort even if the fabric becomes charred. Besides, PBI fiber avoids the chronic toxicity problems associated with asbestos because it processes on standard textile and glove fabricating equipment.[28] PBI also can also be a good substitute for asbestos in several areas of glass manufacturing. 
Tell that to fluoride tri chloride

i wish as well but we all know the rules are different for "these people".
They should be penalized in the amount of all profits made by the defective product. And not just the percentage of the product that was defective. This should be true for all industries in which a company knows something they are selling will harm people, but hides the truth about it.

So if a car company knows they have faulty airbags and they do a cost analysis that they'd only have to pay a fraction in lawsuits compared to the recall or lost profits, then they should lose all money made on the vehicles they put those airbags in. Actually, I think it should be sale price because you know some fuck will do some Hollywood math to make it look like they didn't make a profit. Fucking fine them the sale price of every unit they sold. Make it not worth ever putting someone in danger and hiding it. 
The trouble is that the foot soldiers at the bottom of an enormous company like this, which make up 90%+ of its employed, had absolutely nothing to do with the ethics abuses. They usually had no idea it was even going on. Slapping massive fines/punitive damages on a company that put it out of business hurts about 9x as many innocent people as it hurts guilty people. 
You forgot to mention, this is all happening while spilling toxic gas. 
This is part of my problem when libertarians tell me "the free market will keep companies from doing bad things". Without any regulating agencies, it would be even *harder* to keep these companies accountable (and it's already hard enough).

For example, without regulation, how does the free market punish a company for dumping toxic waste into the water supply?
In China, the guilty ones get executed.

Include in that workers. Same deal. They don't have a responsibility to their workers over shareholders. 
And the "fines" for breaking the law are ALWAYS less than the profit they made by breaking the law. 
Well said and terrifying
Whats even more insidious is how we all (me included) have become complicit in the crimes of these corporations. My iphone was basically made by slaves, but damn I love it. All of the people that work for these companies that pollute and poison us and the environment collect a paycheck soaked in blood, but what choice do they have? 
This is the real reason nothing changes.

It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.


People who worry about 'robots taking over' need to learn that it happened already, long ago. And that most people give their lives in service to these robots, even when it goes against their own morals and principles.
This is why corporations as people doesn’t make sense. Imagine a specific person poisoning babies and parents for years...the would go to prison.
A corporation is the sociological equivalent of a tumour, comprised of cells called "employees". The ultimate goal of every corporation is continually increasing profits, which necessitates continually increasing growth. Regard the humans who make up a society as the cells of a body, and observe that the corporation, much like a tumour, makes decisions which increase its own growth at the expense of non-cancerous cells. (And in fact at the expense of some of its own cells/employees -- regard the awful way Amazon treats its own staff, for example.)
No kidding! I've been trying to boycott Nestle ever since the 90s, and I'm still accidentally buying their products. They are treating crops, even organic, with treated frack wastewater in CA, so I can't buy wine or produce from there now.  Johnson and Johnson is out, so there's another list of brands I have to try to remember. I'm going to have grow all my own food and start having to weave my own cloth before long. 
The answer to "why is capitalism useful" has pretty much always boiled down to "competition helps the consumer." Every time competition falters, pressure drops and only the company's own culture or renewed competitive pressure can prevent it from taking advantage of the increased margin for error. 

SCotUS Justice Antonin Scalia was quoted as saying, "in order for capitalism to work -- in order for it to produce a good and a stable society -- the traditional Christian virtues are essential."  

Not that you need specifically Christian virtues (not that there's even one agreed-upon definition), but the raw form of theoretical capitalism must be tempered by a concern for the wellbeing of people other than oneself in order to prevent a select few cheating their way to the top. 
This list is outdated. For example, they no longer own KY, nor Spenda, et al. Also, this is only consumer products. Good luck boycotting their pharmaceuticals if your life depends on it. 
Phew! Good thing I can't afford them! 
Coach the purse company? No. Coach the bandage brand? Yes. This list is old, outdated, and incorrect. 
>Nicotine's usefulness as a stimulant is hindered by its potency(much easier to accidentally be poisoned), its cardiovascular/angiogenic side effects, its short duration of effect, and its withdrawal effects.

The negative cardiovascular effects and withdrawal effects are specific to tobacco as a delivery mechanism. Studies are sparse in other cases. While it does have a small cardiovascular effect on its own, it's unclear whether it poses a risk to anyone. And the withdrawal effect has certainly not yet been observed in non-smokers.
Just gotta be careful about how much you use or you'll end up with a white tint in your hair that's hard to get out without washing, which may defeat the purpose lol. They do also sell "dry shampoo" sprays at places like Walmart that can do the same thing without worry of a tint, just costs a little more
Except for the asbestos. 
social media was a mistake.
Fuckin' nice
I work outdoors construction in summer. You definitely need it hot summer days. 
A small magnet should do. Take one by mouth twice a day with food. 
Thanks for the info, even if it was a little depressing.
Yup I pack my walls with aquariums. Get at me, fire. 
Greek Fire wants a word
Water is a very poor insulator.
Ok, I’ll insulate with water and see how that works.
Not to mention, the top tier of the corporation will most likely find new jobs pretty quickly. Can't say the same about all the grunts at the bottom who depend on that weekly paycheck to survive.
how could i forget the most important part?! lol
You're meant to sue them...

Yes, sue the multinational that can bury you in an army of lawyers.  I'm sure that'll work.
I've heard many people argue about how things would be great if we just left them to the free market, but they can never explain why it would be *better* than what we have now. The current system in the US is shitty in plenty of different ways, but I've yet to hear a compelling argument or even an explanation for how a total laissez-faire policy would actually fix or improve anything.


> problem when libertarians tell me "the free market will keep companies from doing bad things". 

Most self proclaimed "libertarians" aren't libertarians at all. Libertarianism isn't anarchy. It doesn't mean no government. The word really doesn't have any meaning. 

It's because Libertarians are the Anarcho-Communists of the Right. They're both ideologies favoured by the more hard line fringes of more conventional political ideologies that, according to their proponents, would work great, if only humans would change an utterly fundamental part of human behaviour.
The scapegoat got executed.
That's what the whole 4% of last year's global turnover thing in GDPR is trying to address.
Yuuuup, I'm on Remicade, which is...J&J
What potential medical uses could nicotine have? Tabacco excluded entirely for the sake of conversation.
>Just gotta be careful about how much you use or you'll end up with a white tint in your hair

Or cancer
That’s the best part
Yeah, I gave a bit more info to another reply about how it's more a maybe than a fact (but asbestos causing lung cancer is fact, it's the talc without asbestos that's a maybe).
social media was a mistake.
Not in snow form. 😉
A single person gets buried, a single lawyer in a class action gets buried. A multinational responds to millions of small claims gets buried. It worked for Scientologists didn't it? And they wrecked the US government that way. OOh I wanna see the legal DDOS happen once more!
corporations buy off politicians, politicians (in the u.s., republicans) make it difficult to pursue class action lawsuits, force plaintiffs into arbitration.

"Oh, well, corporations would be forced to make a better product to compete"

"But what if  a bunch of them collude to make a cheap, maybe even poisonous, but shitty product, monopolizing the market?"

"A competitor could easily move in and make a more expensive but healthier//better product."

"And what if they take all those resources, and jack up the price, so the only options are pay out the nose to be healthy, or pay cheap and suffer?"

"Well, they should have worked harder to afford better for their families."

Basically this - Every Libertarian or Anarcho Capitalist I've come across talks like they think they'll be at least in the middle on the societal hierarchy.  They prefer to doom a sitload of humanity so they can save their tax money, honestly.  To the point where some even told me that we'd have just private police forces.  How that would be any different from hired goons, I have no idea, but there you go.  They want to go back to medievalism, basically, thinking they'd be knights and lords, when they'd just be slaves and peasants.
I’ll take my chances
The problem here is that as you start describing such an organization that would organize people to do this, because unorganized the people will never do this, as you describe what this thing does and how the actual mechanics of the thing would operate the more and more it sounds like a government.
democrats are just as bought off as republicans, they just put a smiling face on it.
I used that stuff on my man bits as a post shower, stay fresh n dry kinda thing. It's called baby powder, how could that be bad for you? Assholes.
> The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. 

That's pretty scary. I mean, who hasn't used the stuff? It's a household item. Or at least, it used to be. 
They found traces of asbestos in their talc all the way back in the fifties and instead of getting a better source of talc they spent decades trying to control government testing of their product so they could hide the fact it contained asbestos. Fuck corporations. 
Knowingly poisoning people, including children, for decades should lead to prison time and massive fines on par with the tobacco industry. 
I put that shit on my sweet meats for almost a decade. Where's the class action I can jump on that will send me a check for $10?

So glad I've never used it on my baby...


Of course they did. But there was money to be made. Who cares of about the harm to consumers? 
The all mighty dollar to some people... "Sir, bad news... that baby powder has asbestos. We are going to have to pull it."  "What's our profit margin on that?" "The margins are good sir but it is being sold specifically to infants, we are going to have to pu..." "That will be all. Brian." "But, sir..." "I said that will be all, Brian."
Holy fuck this is unconscionable - this is a product marketed for BABIES. I'm never buying a Johnson & Johnson product again.

edit: [here's a helpful list of their brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Johnson_%26_Johnson_brands)
If that's true then these Johnson & Johnson guys sound like a couple of dicks.
So that's why [J&J had to pay 4.7 billion to women that got ovarian cancer from it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/13/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-4-7-billion-to-women-who-say-baby-powder-gave-them-cancer/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4883c2777bc5).
Lurk seems an odd word to use here. It’s like asbestos independently decided to hangout in baby power and Johnson and Johnson were like “damn, that asbestos is really lurkin around, let’s keep quiet about it”
i see we reached the "cover up decades of having harmful substances in baby stuff"  level of late capitalism.  

next you'll tell me nestle knew the baby  formula they where giving poor african women was bunk too.

oh wait...
Well shit, I used to eat the stuff as a child...
Poured all over my babies in 1989 and the fuckers knew
Jesus fuck they knew for decades and didn't even quietly fix the fucking problem? 
I buy offbrand Walmart baby powder.  Should I be concerned ???
A good reason to stick to corn starch based baby powder.
Even if it doesn’t contain asbestos we are finding more and more evidence that inhaling plain old harmless talc in babypowder, or the silicates in drywall dust etc also create lasting cumulative and irreversible damage. Who could ever have guessed that inhaling microscopic stone particles with sharp edges could have been bad for your lungs? 
:-/ this is what happens when you don't actually regulate entities that exist only to bring value to shareholders. they don't care about people, just the bottom line.
That's some China level negligence there. (melamine in baby formula). Remember what happened to those people?

Anyways, don't we test products anymore?  Why didn't this get reported decades ago?
We’ll put “No more tears on the label.”


But it does make you cry...


I know, muhahahahaha!
I imagine the PR campaign to control this will look something [like this](https://youtu.be/ykm3GI1oTnQ).
They'll get a nice tax cut out of this, don't worry. That's punishment enough. /s
Nobody is talking about all the baby butts that didn’t catch on fire as a result of their efforts. 
Lower your pitchforks and actually read the entire article... this occurred nearly 50 years ago.

Okay so for people just reading one sentence or two or going off the sensationalist title... know that this was in the early 70's. Research had been coming out at that point indicating trace amounts  (between 1 to 3%) in talc powders sourced from the talc J&J bought and NOT their baby powders directly.

They did further testing and and research. FDA was involved and multiple organizations doing investigations and concluded it was safe. 

There was legal battles. There were investigations and testing done already. If you were a baby pre 1973, maybe this was cause for concern. Well not really. however there were many products and substances that we now know have higher instances of causing cancers or illness that were used plenty back than.

TL;DR: stop making rapid conclusions before reading into the situation. J&J were investigated and this began 50 years ago. If baby powder was used on you and you were born after 1980's... chill.
they should be castrated as a company, put out of business. not only did they KNOW, they CONTINUED to make it the same way. they didn't change the formula, they didn't clean it up. they willingly poisoned people, FOR DECADES, and there should be no forgiveness for that.
This gives the super-moms on my Facebook feed something else to talk about for months. Joy 
Another GEAT REPUBLICAN INDU$$$TEY REGULATE$$$$ ITSELF-- remember, regulation is written in blood 💉💉💉💉💉💉
It's funny how all science seems to go out the window when a lynch mob is involved.  A whole lot of studies have shown there is no link from asbestos to ovarian cancer.  Including the FDA.  And asbestos is found everywhere, including the air we breathe.

Somehow 99.99% of people have used this product without getting ovarian cancer.  Why aren't we shutting those down?

Numerous people have even died eating vegetables from organic gardens.  
I'm sure they tried asbestos they could
Is it still?
Is asbestos bad for your balls? Asking for a friend.
Really?! Well fuck
Boycott Johnson and Johnson, done!
I'm sure the penalties will be swift and harsh.

Right?
Tobacco knew about the cancer risks for nearly a century

&#x200B;

Fossil Fuels knew about the risk of anthropogenic climate change for at least half a century.

&#x200B;

The private ownership of capital invested in these industries enables this exploitation of our health and planet for profit. Communal ownership is the only answer to this problem, whether it be through co-operatives, state ownership with worker control, or anarchism. We've tried to regulate, and tried just letting them be honest, but they've never put anything ahead of profit, and never really will, despite any flowery language to the contrary.
"snap chat will regulate the market" -Dave Rubin
When the fine costs less than changing their business practices this is what happens. 
I would encourage everyone to read up on the science involved in these cases. The scientific community overwhelmingly accepts that there is no link between talcum powder and cancer. Conveniently not mentioned in this article, the large jury verdict mentioned in California was overturned by the court on the basis that *no reasonable person* could have found, based on the scientific and expert evidence presented, that talcum powder causes cancer. So again, I’d encourage everyone to read the actual science involved rather than this Reuters article, which skirts around the issue.     
    
Edit with sources, but there are many more:    
    
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25214560/

"Conclusions: Among 61576 postmenopausal women, followed for a mean of 12.4 years without a history of cancer or bilateral oophorectomy, 52.6% reported ever using perineal powder. Ever use of perineal powder (hazard ratio [HR]adj = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87 to 1.28) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use. Individually, ever use of powder on the genitals (HRadj = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.36), sanitary napkins (HRadj = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.20), or diaphragms (HRadj = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.23) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use, nor were there associations with increasing durations of use. Estimates did not differ when stratified by age or tubal ligation status.

Based on our results, perineal powder use does not appear to influence ovarian cancer risk."

Eur J Cancer Prev. 2008 Apr;17(2):139-46. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32811080ef. Conclusions: "... In this review article, we discuss the chemical and morphological features of talc and asbestos, and explain why despite their similar chemical classification talc does not possess asbestos-like carcinogenic properties ... In addition, the therapeutic use of high dose cosmetic grade talc for pleurodesis has not been shown to cause cancer in patients receiving these treatment modalities. Talc is not genotoxic. Mechanistic, pathology and animal model studies have not found evidence for a carcinogenic effect. In summary, these data collectively do not indicate that cosmetic talc causes ovarian cancer."

Regarding the reversed case in St. Louis, the American Council on Science and Health summarized the evidence presented as follows: “Studies were done that have looked at talc-containing diaphragms and condoms (that are directly introduced into the female genital tract and not just a light perineal dusting) have failed to reveal any increased carcinogenic effect. In rat studies, lifelong, whole-body talc exposure was not associated with increased rates of ovarian cancer. Additionally, in talc miners and millers, there were no increased rates of lung tumors.  The studies that suggested some possible link were case-control studies which are highly susceptible to recall bias.”

https://www.jstor.org/stable/27732654?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

“In conclusion, no increased lung cancer mortality was observed among talc millers despite their high exposure experience.”

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230002915606

“There is no credible evidence of a cancer risk from inhalation of cosmetic talc by humans. Considering talc a carcinogen lacks convincing scientific documentation.”
Someone please bury these bastards
It's a good thing they relaxed the rules on asbestos.

watch nothing will happen to JnJ. The stock might drop a few percentages and will go back up even more and continue to operate without any actions. Might get a tap on the wrist some small fine. No will be accountable for their action. We live in a sick world.

But trump said Asbestos is “100% Safe”!
Talc Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 is the product of decay of basalt type rocks, as is serpentine Mg6Si4O10(OH)8. These are sheet silicates, the two minerals talc and serpentenite often form together. Serpentenite can form a curved crystal structure, that often coils into a crystal structure called asbestiform. There are six forms of asbestos, only one of which is considered dangerous due to the human body's inability to break it down.

Truth being the daughter of Time, and not the daughter of Authority, as many presume. I think those of us in the US will find--as did the Europeans--that asbestos is not as dangerous as we once presumed. And that most asbestos related sickness (mesothelomia) is going to be tied to smoking. Especially the suppression of normal pulmonary activity--self-cleaning lung mechanisms--which is the result of smoking.
Asbestos is Trump Approved (tm) though.
But we don't need regulation, the free market can be trusted to keep this sort of thing under control! /s

Looks like in addition to the CFPB we need another department devoted to randomly testing things to find what companies are causing major problems to save a few cents here and there.
So glad I avoided using that shit on my kids! I had a bad feeling about it!
This is exactly what happens when corporations have a fiduciary duty to their share holders to maximize profits.  

Period.  

Full stop.  

End of message.
One of the Johnson and Johnson heirs was also a pedophile and he raped his stepdaughter hundreds of times. 
Wait to you see what's been aloud in food production in the US for decades or in you live in or near and major cities, your water is not something you want to drink at all. These companies have spent more money trying to do the same damn destructive things than it would take to just fix the problems. Its about making the current investors happy now, not the long term problems.
True Story...

Despite knowing for decades how bad asbestos was including government studies in the 40's, cigarette companies used to put it in filters.
Why is asbestos used in these products? 
Is this what has caused the link between talc and cancer? As in, is there actually a link between pure talc and cancer, or was it just the talc laced with asbestos causing cancer?
wait... what?  I use the generic version ... i should be concerned???
I still have this in my bathroom. Should I throw it out? I don't know what's going on...
I'm just waiting for the world banking system to go down...
What about gold bond powder??
News from the 1970's. Everything old is new again. 
Sounds like a case for Erin Brockovich.
Just another reason I find baby powder absolutely disgusting 
Does generic baby powder not have aspestos in it?
I put this on my balls every so often and I smoke.  I am gonna die. But also maybe sooner. Cool.
And yet nothing will come of this
Oh good, I was probably exposed.
Its so the kids don't get chafe burn.
So... Is there still asbestos in the powder? Or do I need to throw it all out?
hopefully that $20B in costs associated with this asinine decision that CNBC is estimating today is on the low end
I heard people also eat it on the dl...
Seems like a good time to plug MeUndies , have bot used baby powder since! A little expensive but worth the money!
Find this almost impossible to believe. 
So you’re saying it’s time to start smuggling Chinese baby powder to the US?
i'm so glad I never quit smoking.  If I was gonna end up getting mesothelioma anyway, fuck it.  
Asbestos is not good for you. Neither is cocaine, smoking, drinking. Using it wisely and with security measure would definitely be better than banning it.
Gynecological reactions if some women from talc exposure,  in womens internal reproductive tract and into the abdominal cavity,  were a thing when I was reviewing documents nearly thirty years ago.  
I do flooring and we hit a patch of old covered asbestos tiles this morning. They tried to get me to keep doing the job I told them to fuck off no amount of money is worth the health risks and getting sued. Three day weekend baby. I'll finish once its abated.
How the hell did the public just find out about this in 2018?  
Wow shocking, capitalism put profits before people, never seen that before...
So it would have been safer to rub dirt all over my body instead? Fucking baby powder?
I wonder how Jamie Johnson feels about all this.
Meanwhile, Grunenthal, the producer of Thalidomide and the cause of a generation "Thalidomide babies" still exists. 
I thought it was common knowledge that talc and asbestos were often found together
See this is why I'm for treating companues as legal people with legal penalties. 

Including the death penalty.

If your job involves killing people, and you do so for profit, you and everybody who knew should be executed. 

Harsh, but fair.
Lazy research question: What is Asbestos really & how did it get into our daily lives? Should we all really be worried about it? 
Wow. A miracle gone tragic. So what do you think the industry is doing now to prevent more traces of asbestos from falling into our households? 

I remember seeing those “silica” packets as a kid in my new shoes. Never knew what it was.
What are alternatives. 
Does this mean a nationwide recall, pulling it off the shelfs like they did with romaine?
and their no tears shampoo creates tears.


I played the tabla as a child and to keep your hands from getting damp/ sweaty we'd use talcum powder, which in the west is Johnsons & Johnsons 100% talc baby powder... I would apply it 3-5 times on my hands depending on how often I would practice a day.
We keep finding new body counts for capitalism every day. Every single person that died and will die because of exposure was murdered, don't let the capitalists tell you otherwise.
Cool. I used that stuff on my toe pads when I did pointe. Awesome. 
Guys -- make sure you're using corn starch baby powder and NOT talc. 
>  how could that be bad for you?

Because it's cheaper for them to not care about any bad shit getting into it. Gotta increase those profits, gotta care about the bottom line above all else. Infinite growth and infinite profitability has no downsides whatsoever right?
[removed]
Talc can also give women ovarian cancer if it migrates up into our bits. Think how many generations of baby girls have had that slapped on their tushes. 
Wait- I still do that. Is this still a problem? Do I need to stop?
> It's called baby powder, how could that be bad for you? Assholes.

No, lungs mostly.
Get fresh balls it’s the best and safest 
TIL adult males use baby powder to dry their donger area.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think asbestos is only harmful if you breathe it in, right? Rubbing it on your skin wouldn't do anything
>Assholes

Your man bits are on the other side. 

But in all seriousness, I sent this story to a buddy who, like you, puts baby powder on his balls; he doesn’t want kids but his wife does so I told him it looks like he’s going to win that argument. 
asbestos is so insidious because it's incredibly fine and resistant. That shit getting stuck in your body anywhere, in any capacity, is never going to get out. There's no safe level of exposure because 1 fiber is 10 too many.
I’m not trying to say that Asbestos isn’t a class one carcinogen (meaning that it is without a doubt a direct cause of certain cancers) but if you somehow find out that you were exposed to some asbestos fibers it’s nothing to lose sleep over. Mesothelioma can happen in theory after being exposed to just a single fiber (specifically crocidolite), but that disease is very rare. Other diseases like lung cancer and asbestosis only really occur in people who worked with it daily for a number of years (think mechanics who would change breaks, construction workers who would do a lot of demolition work, and ship yard workers who would spray it on the ships, or family members of these workers who would get exposed via the worker’s clothing). 

Again not trying to defend Asbestos, it’s just not something to lose sleep over if you haven’t been chronically exposed, if limited exposure was that dangerous everyone who has ever lived in a large city with a lot of old buildings would be dying of Mesothelioma right now. 

It’s also worth noting that asbestos is only dangerous when the material that it is present in is in a friable state (meaning you can easily bring the material to a crumble with your fingers). So if an asbestos containing material located within a building is in good condition, it’s not a health hazard. This is why it is only recommended to abate the material if there is planned renovation or demolition work on the building that might cause the fibers to become airborne. 

Source: I used to work as an asbestos inspector 
That's their nice way of saying one single fiber can fuck you up. Because it can. They don't "go away" that one single fiber would be stuck in you FOR LIFE. (Now imagine the possibility of more than one...)
I dig around in my yard and found a few buried asbestos tiles and flowerpots. I thought it lokked wierd so broke of a small piece and looked close indoors and sure enought, it was fibric minerals. I still havent found a recycling center that accept them, so they are in a black plastic bag in the barn with red tape crossed over. Now I was reminded by them and feel like I need to get rid of them before someone picks them up. 
Everyone is constantly exposed to asbestos throughout their lives.  The stuff is everywhere, from brake pads and clutches to construction materials. It is also a naturally occurring mineral so it can easily be blown around when exposed due erosion or digging.  Background asbestos levels are between 10 and 200 asbestos fibres in every 1000 litres air.  
So, crazy story about asbestos. Saw a documentary that detailed the archeological excavation of an abandoned ancient village, I think in South America. The researchers just couldn’t figure out what killed these people. Their dwellings were cut into rock and were still standing. 

Then the researchers found out that the rock contained large amounts of minerals that, when processed, made asbestos. So they think that daily exposure to the rock since birth pretty much weakened the people and they died early. Wish I could find the documentary or an article on it. Crazy stuff. 
In what way did it use to be a household item? Here it was strictly used for insulation, back in the day.

Curious, was asbestos known to be harmful back in the 50s?
> found traces of asbestos

The traces thing bothers me.  Asbestos is a mineral.  I'm not a geologist (and I would appreciate one chiming in) but whenever we've hit asbestos when digging (it's super common by the way) it's been in deposits.  So are the "traces" actually very contaminated batches, but it only happens every once in a while when they hit a deposit?  

Trace contamination doesn't worry me, what worries me is that this probably isn't trace contamination. 
I mean corporations are just groups of people. As are governments. Governments do terrible things. Corporations do terrible things. People do terrible things.  The root of the problem is people are selfish, greedy, liars. Corporations and governments misbehaving is a symptom of that problem.
Every CEO during those decades should be put in prison.
Thats the definition of evil capitalism.  Prioritizing making money over the health of babies
I mean, what were they gonna do? Make less money? Insanity!
Corporations are a state creation. They could be abolished overnight and responsibility would fall back fully into the owners and executives. One could start with banks that have no business creating liabilities far into the future for present profit with zero human responsibility (while also having the state given right of having the monopoly over that).
Its not really corporations, its outright human nature. When you have a shit govt that cant fjnction companies and people will get away with everything
Fuck Capitalism. 

I wonder if Johnson and Johnson was  worker cooperative if this same shit would have happened. 

My guess is no. Half the workers probably use their own product.
It's this kind of shit that baffles me as to why anyone would be opposed to federal regulation over corporations. 

My dad is a traditional conservative and believes the government should just stay out of it and let businesses do their thing. But this shit right here is exactly why corporations need to be regulated, because they don't give a damn about anyone or anything other than their bottom line. Companies would rather dump nuclear waste and allow asbestos in your baby powder than spend a single penny more to maintain the quality and safety of the product.

It's absolutely baffling why anyone (other than those profiting from it) doesn't see how incredibly irresponsible and reckless companies are when it comes to protecting their obscene pay checks.

Fuck people more like it
Ok I don’t want this to come across as anti-vax **because I’m not** (bolded that so the point doesn’t get misconstrued) but the big pharma corporations are probably the worst at hiding/concealing/lying about things like this and it actually gives *some* credence to their otherwise unbelievable claims. 
Hangings. They killed a lot of people with that garbage. Those that started and those that knowingly perpetuated it should hang for their actions. 
Bring back the guillotine.
Anyone who know and said nothing should get no less than life imprisonment without parole and all their money funneled into cancer treatment/research 

Anything less is not justice 
Prison time? Pfft. The government will just ask for their yearly hush money like always! 
This is America
The bastards probably calculated the costs back then of recalling it and dealing with the fallout versus not doing anything for years and paying out lawsuits/fines later and deemed it more profitable to do the latter. Disgusting. 
Took me a second to stop being confused about why you'd put this on food.
Why do people use this on their dick? I’ve had a dick for 19 years and I am very confused
Your alt account can be cancerballz.
Won’t anybody think about the poor “job creators”?  We as a people are running out of time to stop the new Gilded Era, if it’s not already too late, and this time it’s going to be a lot harder to avoid modern serfdom - the control/leverage over all forms of media is nearly complete with the death of net neutrality.
And they were complaining that the 10% (40b) drop in share price as a reaction to this was outsized, as it wasn't likely to cost them more than 40b to deal with the legal repercussions. 
Too bad they have many medical products you may not be able to avoid...
Yeah, I use something in almost every letter there :/
Look at the “B” section, really?
Add Polysporin to the list and that’s basically my entire medicine cabinet fml
Good luck with that. JNJ is my client and the amount of household products they have (shampoo, facial cleanser, etc.), they’re hard to avoid. 
If true then ultimately some people will die because of this. If true the guys responsible should be held fully accountable for this - one way or another 
These are the two FBI guys in Die Hard right?
Killing people for money's sake is more than being a dick. They deserve to be tried for murder, every responsible employee or executive.
If you are alluding to the slang use of "Johnson," I see you... 
I knew one of their granddaughters in college. She despised the fact that the company supported anti-LGBTQ organizations, but was otherwise an unpleasant and unreliable person herself. 
Especially that Johnson one.

My grandmother is one of these women. No amount of money can repay the years of suffering she has experienced due to cancer from this product. Her body was able to fight the cancer, but in the process hurt her as well (Paraneoplastic syndrome) and she has been bed ridden hardly able to speak and on a feeding tube for 10 years. It's like she is being slowly tortured to death.  I wish the top dogs in this company that knowingly hid this were put in prison for life. 
It's not that the formula was bunk, it's that they would give new mothers enough free formula to last until their own milk stopped producing, thus making them dependant on the formula and would be forced to buy it or their infant would starve.

Talk about evil.
Well good luck. Even without the asbestos thing, good luck.
This is something I would expect to read on r/kenm
My grandma put it on me for years in the 90s. Its horrific.
47 years is SEVERAL working lives. That's hundreds, if not thousands, of people who knew about it and did nothing.
According to the article, talc is found naturally in the earth alongside asbestos. I probably wouldn't trust any corporation or their claims that their product is untainted. Would probably be expensive to purify the product, and Walmart isn't a charity, that's for sure.
I'm sure scientists will eventually discover that corn starch causes medical problems too.
> or the silicates in drywall dust etc also create lasting cumulative and irreversible damage

Feeling better about getting a mask w/ filter for work around my house.

until I find out the filter is killing me too, ofc.
As the article mentions, the FDA has been regularly testing baby powder for asbestos since the 70s (with preliminary testing by J&J in the 50s). The FDA found no asbestos. Plaintiffs have been arguing that the FDAs methods were not sensitive enough and/or set the threshold too high for unsafe levels.
How is your comment so far down, I'm reading this wondering if I should sell all my shares and is this company going down.
The free market is going to fix this any minute now. Just gotta let the free market market. Don't ask how, it's not important.
I feel like comments like this don’t completely understand the economic viewpoints of a true libertarian. The reason companies cannot be punished is because of caps put on the amount of money a company can be sued. It’s still government intervention, albeit in favor of corporations. True libertarianism doesn’t allow for lobbying, which get companies these protective laws, as they believe that government should not be allowed to have any intervention with the market, whether it be for or against. This allows for a truly “free market” to actually be able to correct itself, as companies could actually be sued for money that isn’t a fraction of their total revenue. 

Edit- Just to give a specific example, some people are claiming that the FDA was not properly testing these products. Why would that happen? Money being pushed in favor of lower testing thresholds, if true. Just figured you’d want an example on how a “free market” would actually correct its issues, vs. government intervention.
I wonder if the slap on the hand will leave a mark.
That's not what this article is saying - it's saying that J&J has repeatedly found asbestos in their talc sources, and it ends up in their baby power. Inhaled asbestos IS known to cause cancer.

So yeah, it's not the talc - it's J&J's inability to remove asbestos from talc, and the deliberately not disclosing their findings to the regulatory bodies and consumers.
I wish I never did, I just found out about the amount of asbestos in the air and how it slowly kills you.

> We visited there many times and the curators said there was ample evidence even in Roman times that it was deadly if inhaled.

That's a particularly persistent mistake that's existed in the asbestos literature for decades.  I researched it for one of my grad school classes and it started with a misunderstanding of Pliny the Elder and Strabo.
Beautiful, clean asbestos.

Asbestos was a bit of a "miracle" material. It was a cheap, fire/heat/electrical insulator/resistor. It was used in electronics, buildings as an insulation in place of fibreglass.

Asbestos use really took off at the beginning of the 19th century through the later part of the 20th.

Then we found out it caused lung cancer and it was basically everywhere and in everything.

To answer your question about what it is, it's a naturally occurring silica compound that's mineable. The crystals form in long strands, not unlike what fiberglass looks like. Those fibres are made up of millions of smaller fibrils. These fibrils are what can easily get released into the air through abrasion and enter the lungs, causing the cancer mesothelioma.
Natural occuring cotton like stuff, super fire resistant, has been used by humans for centuries, but with the industrial revolution became used everywhere, it is a carcinogenic (what isn't?), I think mostly when inhaled.
No because the plaintiffs will lose on appeal just like they have in every other case. Oh, and because there hasn't been even trace amounts of asbestos-like fibers in their talc destined for consumers since 1976 and in their talc destined for industrial use since 1981.
Corn starch powder just doesn't do the trick for me, but I guess batwings are better than mesothelioma 
Yeahhhhhh, I tried Burt's Bees cornstarch version. It doesn't do anything. 
Is gold bond ok?  I'm seriously worried now because I've been dusting that on my privates and under my arms for years now.
Unless using it for casting. Then you are better off with talc base.  The corn stuff causes funky reactions. 
Yeah, I can't stand the erg baby powder. I have to use it so I don't get jock itch. I get the lavender one, cornstarch + fragrance. 
Why is that?  I just bought some talc.
Isn’t talc aluminum?
Daily reminder that common economic analyses ignore leisure time/public health as variables worthy of consideration.
Capitalism in a nutshell.
This is why regulation is needed, why governments are needed to regulate.

It's all very well the liberatarian economists saying that if a product is no good 'the market' will ensure competing products are more successful, but if nobody knows the product is defective because the manufacturer is doing everything it can to conceal the defect, and if it takes 70 years and thousands of people are dead or horribly sick, the 'market correction' is no fucking use at all.
That's why I make my own.  You can't trust manufacturers these days.

False advertising! Bake'em away, toys!
It's a problem if you breath it.

Asbestos is dangerous because it's very, very fine, so fine you can't even see it in the air. Because it's so tiny, and thin, it floats in the air when it's dry or broken up. In that capacity, you can very easily inhale it.

Now here's what's fucked up: most inhaled particles, our body can eventually filter or break down. Most stuff you breathe in - even pollutants - are usually, eventually broken down or expelled by your lungs and airways.

But asbestos is not only very small, it's also incredibly resilient, to the point where it will nest in your lungs for decades, scraping away at the lung tissue, causing scarring and damage on a microscopic level.

As those cells that it harms dies, new cells are created, thus increasing the risk of cancer in your lungs greatly.

The shittiest part about asbestos is there's really no safe amount to inhale, but because of how common its use is in the US, we've pretty much all been exposed to at least a little bit at some point or another. Now, not everyone who breathes in asbestos will develop cancer or disease. But the more you inhale, the more likely it is to embed in your lungs, scrape at your tissue and remain trapped for years, raising the risk that you eventually develop cancerous cells or destroyed tissue.

You probably shouldn't worry about it, though... chances are you and the rest of us have been exposed at some point, and not all of us will die from or even develop Mesothelioma. The folks who historically get it the worst were workers who manufactured the stuff, and their young kids who were exposed to dust and fine particles from said manufacturing plants. But it's definitely shitty of companies to knowingly expose us to it.
Yeah dude, play it safe. Even though it's just topical, you're breathing the dust and it's friggin asbestos! Use what another person suggested, the corn starch stuff or nothing at all. Nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all...
If you are a man - yes, you will breathe small amounts and it can cause the worst (or one of) cancer there is.

If you are a woman - most certainly yes, because it can do that AND cause cancer in your reproductive organs.
It's not like you can get cancer in your balls, right?
Are you male?  If so, you're probably safe.  If not, it's a cancer risk.  Probably not great for male organs, either, tbh.
J&J baby powder is now corn starch based so it's ok. Stay away from the kind made from talcum.
It's not even fibers most of the time, by the time its in the consumer's hands its powdered. Honestly I'm not surprised by this because they probably mine talc and asbestos out of the same pits
My friend got a new house and they thought abestos could be in there so they had fucking bags full of this shit all over and weird dust over everything. I didnt go to his place for 6 months after the stuff was out!
Relax it not like you would grind the fucking thing in a fine powder and put it on your junk...
It's too bad.

Asbestos is such an amazing invention. 
Smoking is something like a 55x factor on the risk, too. 
Good to see some common sense in this thread.  The way some uninformed people speak about it, you might think it’s radioactive.
Asbestos: Not Even Once
That’s not really true.  The body can clear most particles of chrysotile (white asbestos), just very slowly.  Brown and Blue asbestos are the ones that stick around for all time.
Not at all...
You can’t tell for sure it has asbestos without a microscope.  In MA, they let you dispose of asbestos tiles in your trash as solid waste, they’re that harmless.
Asbestos isn’t used in brake pads anymore 
If you've ever gone into a landfill, chances are you've been exposed to asbestos.

The asbestos industry knew it was harmful since the 1930's but hid it from the public.
Yeah, but don't sweat it. Trump says it's great.

He claims fears over it were just part of a big mob conspiracy and he's ramping up it's use now. Guess who produces a lot of it. Go ahead, guess.
Asbestos is harmful at all levels. Talc is often found naturally near asbestos ore. The way I see it, if you keep on using talc, you will get exposed to asbestos sooner or later.
Geologist here. Talc and asbestos (actually a group of related amphibole minerals) are both commonly formed within metamorphic rocks. The amounts of different minerals depend on the conditions of metamorphism and on what the original rock was. Having deposits of one with trace inclusions of the other is very possible. 

Presumably the geologist on-site is *supposed* to be analyzing what they're digging up to make sure it's mostly talc. But I guess the Almighty Dollar has the power to overrule the geologists. 
Nice to see some logic in here. People seem to think corporations and their actions are the result of a lone evil CEO and his decisions. Kek. Most people in this thread work for corporations. Reddit is part of a corporation. Regular humans and human nature are the problem.
Why not just abolish the corporation? It's a state-given legal privilege.
Because this shouldn't be a case for regulations, it should be a case for criminal justice.  Executives that sell products tainted with poisons should be handled the same way someone mailing out anthrax filled letters is handled.

Regulations are just pointless bureaucracy that hurts tax payers and smaller businesses without providing any real benefit.

The only cases where regulations could potentially be justified is in cases with no clear victim and unquantifiable harm like polluting in a wildlife preserve.

People HAVE died.  The article said the powder has been linked with 6000 cases linking the powder to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.  

It is un fucking believable that they have known this for nearly 50 years.  People have died, and for what?  For J&J, one of the biggest companies in the world, to increase their profits by a few percentage points?

People need to be imprisoned over this.

I mean the "how" would be people choosing not to purchase J&J products anymore but yea totally. 
Without regulations there would be nothing that requires their product to be tested in the first place, and without regulations there would be nothing to hold any independent agencies accountable to provide non-biased data. How would the magical free market solve this dilemma?
Correct.  The article is neglecting to report on scientific literature specifically regarding asbestos in talc, and specifically in cosmetic talc. It’s not a newly discovered phenomena that talc contains small amounts of asbestos. There are scientific studies which link inhaled talc (containing asbestos) with cancer, but those studies are for talc miners, where asbestos levels vary and are high. Studies regarding cosmetic talc, which has been purified (though clearly not 100%) do not find any causal link between inhaling cosmetic talc and cancer. Additionally, these cases don’t even deal with inhaling baby powder at all. These lawsuits are with regard to the perineal use of baby powder. And there is no scientific evidence which finds any causal link between perineal use of baby powder (even that which contains small amounts of asbestos) and cancer (specifically ovarian cancer, which is at issue in these cases).

Don't try his mosquito bite wax/repellent down there either - definitely a case of treatment worse than the cause
you can make your own baby powder with cornstarch and oils. I'd recommend eucalyptus, coconut, and aloe oils if you want a little zing that will be nice on your skin
Does it have talc in it? It's not like it's just J&J talc.... it's talc in general. J&J just 1) sold a shitload of talc over the years and 2) had the test results to prove it was contaminated with asbestos and didn't do anything with that information
Not that I use either, but the slightest possibility of cancer sounds like a funky reaction.
There are so many posts in this thread asking if talc is bad, did any of you read the article? It's literally the whole reason this thread exists. 


Asbestos and talc are minerals that form in similar conditions. Most talc is contaminated
Did you... read the article?
Nope. No Aluminum in there. 
A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
> Daily reminder that common economic analyses ignore 

Economists are some of the most evil people on the planet. They do nothing but excuse bad behavior by ignoring everything but what can be quantified in profit. Horrible horrible people. 
Not always. Consider the fire protection industry in the US in the late 1800s/early 1900s.

Building insurance companies we're sick of paying out settlements to fire victims of shoddy construction at the time so they banded together and founded the National fire protection agency (NFPA). They created the first standards concerning building fire resistant structures and required owners of existing and new building to follow these standards or they would lose their insurance policies. 

New construction requires a high capital investment and existing buildings are a big asset. Most people can't cover the costs by themselves and need a bank to cover some of it. Even if they can cover all of it they have a shit ton of money they would rather not lose over night and not have a fall back to recoup their loses and pay out on negligence.

So now the building insurance industry has said "build/retrofit the way we want you to or you're not covered" and everyone complied because no bank is going to give you a loan if you didn't and you'd be a complete moron with your own money to lose it all in a fire over night with no coverage.

Eventually state and city government's started taking the NFPA requirements and adding them into local code, but that took years and even decades. 

So in this situation the market corrected itself for the public's benefit, based on the economic benefit of the insurance industry imposing it's requirements on the construction industry. This doesn't always happen but saying the free market doesn't align with public health every time is disingenuous.


They don't necessarily *ignore* things like public health/environmental impact as variables (may ignore leisure time, not sure), but they certainly seem to undervalue them.
It's also people. 

Don't forget this. There isn't some guy named Johnson and Johnson. 

These were people who knew this, went along with it, collected their paychecks, and went home to their community every night. They took their kids to soccer practice next to people who were using this product on themselves - and on their kids.

Nothing but pure, 100% baby in this powder!
This post reminded my of the time we played paintball in the abandoned hospital. Preeeeety sure it was abandoned because asbestos.
When my brother and I were toddlers we threw baby powder everywhere. We dead
To add to this. Most schools are chocked full of it because of the time they were erected and the cost of materials. Kids are destructive and things with asbestos are crazy resilient. Ceiling tiles? Yep. Flooring tiles? At least the adhesive underneath. Boiler systems? Check. Piping? Probably lead. Double whammy with asb insulation. Anyone who has ever grown up has been near it for a long time. That being said, as long as it's undisturbed there's no problem and the typical person hasn't been around friable(crushable by finger strength) types of asbestos that would be more aggressive exposure. 
Used to work in a kitchen. If shit got really hot and bad, I would just grab a handful of straight corn starch and toss it into my shorts. Works great, if you can keep yourself from thinking about those sauces you get with your Chinese takeout.
Well, you also have to look at what is actually causing the cancer. 

Rubbing asbestos all over yourself wont give you cancer in those areas, asbestos increases risk of cancer if you breathe it in because the microscopic fibers tear your lungs up from the inside as you breathe, requiring your body to copy a lot more cells than it typically needs to. 
Is that good or bad?
They do because talc and asbestos are typically found together in nature.
I just spent 2k having asbestos abatement done in my house. It was worth the peace of mind
It’s actually naturally occurring minerals. People have been using Asbestos for at least 4,500 years. 
Asbestos wasn't invented. It's a natural product.
I guess its time for some more of that there innovation 
When I went through asbestos abatement training it was explained to me as asbestos exposure is probably OK, asbestos plus smoking is probably cancer. 

Note that he doesn’t mean asbestos exposure is fine, but in the low levels that abatement workers encounter it makes for a relatively low risk. 
Yup, it works synergistically. So let’s say that your asbestos exposure and smoking would both hypothetically give you a 5% increase in cancer risk, that means your risk is now 25%.

Sooo it’s pretty much true.
So you're agreeing with him. After opening with "That's not really true".
Not in your lungs.
Yes, there is the chance I was wrong. But I studied geology in uni and learnt to identify minterals if they were asbesthos. My step dad is a doctor of geology and I gave the peace to him and he said perhaps it is so be carefull.  The objects are too big to fit in my bin and I don't dare break them up if it is, I went to the recycling center and they gave me an adress a few hours drive away, that's when I put it on hold.

edit: I was never sure it was asbesthos, but it's a [certain gray color](https://imgur.com/a/ZuIByoO) and when I googled them I found similar. My step dad is a petro guy so he could not tell either.  


edit 2: now that I think about it, they have the very same mold pattern on the inside. I am not taking any risks and it's illegal not to give it to the city recycling center, over 5kg and I have to pay them to take care of it :(
>3M’s Haile-Selassie called the internal memos a small set of documents that “portrays an incomplete and misleading story and distorts the full record” of 3M’s work. It also distorts “who we are as a company,” she said.

This sort of "PR" should be illegal. Paying a fine ($850 million in 3M's case here) while getting to **not admit guilt** should also be illegal. It just reinforces the fact that they can "spin" the narrative to unknowing people that their products are safe and to keep consuming them.

Lucy Deane Streatfeild, a factory inspector in the UK, first associated asbestos with illness in textile factory workers in 1898.  However, asbestosis was not identified in the medical literature until W.E. Cooke published an article on it in the *British Medical Journal* in 1924 (although he did not use the term).

[Here's](https://pmj.bmj.com/content/80/940/72) a link to a nice overview of asbestos research.  Streatfeild is left out, of course, as she usually is.

Not only near, the two are virtually inseperable because they form under the same geological conditions. Literally every talc deposit on the planet is accompanied by a form of asbestos (of which there are several varieties).
I honestly don't understand enough about the history of corporations to say whether that would be good or bad long term. Im sure there must be some genuine benefit to the idea of a corporation. But honestly, I can't immediately say it would be a bad idea to abolish them.

> People need to be imprisoned over this.

Sometimes you wonder if that isn’t enough!
How do you get ovarian cancer from asbestos? From what I understand the mechanism of carcinogenesis in asbestos involves white cells trying to phage the asbestos fibres, meaning it should be localised to the asbestos. I don't know how you manage to get asbestos fibres in your ovaries
That's why I'm here. What are we angry about?
You weren't supposed to do that.

Fortunately, as long as you don't smoke, cancer from asbestos exposure is still pretty rare. Asbestos has monster synergy with smoking, but by itself, it's not so bad. We're talking about adjusting the rates of getting certain cancers, that by themselves are pretty rare, by something like 2-fold versus 30-fold or more.

Already done...just look up Aerogel

If/when Aerogel becomes cheap enough that stuff is a much greater insulator than Asbestos and far more resilient to fire. If a house could be insulated with this stuff I'd imagine that despite the up front cost for it you would save a lot of money in the long run.

It's because asbestos is presented to people as a major biohazard material. Like if you even come close to it you'll die. 

It's about as dangerous as working with 120v <20amp live wires.
No, because 95% of asbestos used in construction products was chrysotile.

The fact that the flowerpots were buried rather than disposed of could also suggest that the previous owner didn't want to pay for its proper disposal. Shame that you're the one getting penalized for their laziness.
Hell at that point the entire company and its assets should be seized and distributed to compensate victims.
So, just an unrelated coincidence, but Fanna Haile-Selassie used to be a reporter on my local news before taking this job. I'm from a small rural area, and she wasn't even one of the main reporters here, so it's a little weird seeing her be the PR spin-person for a huge corporation in a national story.
A great political system in which the corrupt party tries to grab as much money and power as it can; and the impassive party’s major selling point is how it’s *not* the corrupt party. 

Though admittedly people keep telling me how Obama’s administration (and Democrats) usually can’t do much because the Republicans are always cockblocking them.

So I guess we should be criticising the system as a whole instead of any particular party? And even then, will it do anything when so much money and power is already controlled by such a small group of people?
Probably plastic. Especially microwaving plastic/putting it in the dishwasher.
Anti-depressants and hormonal birth control among other drugs in the water supply because waste treatment plants can't remove them effectively.  Its already proven to effect wildlife and almost certainly is effecting humans as well.
In 2000 the answer would be climate change. Right now it is either plastics or data harvesting.
Smells good, feels good, assists with humidity and climate control.

Same reason folks have put it on a baby's ass for 100+ years. 
You should contact a lawyer - there are a number of lawsuits being filed against J&J, you may end up being compensated.  In July 2018, 22 women were awarded $4.7 billion in a class action suit.  And there are going to be a lot more after this report.
Well asbestos is actually created by wizards. Its a dark magic powder, so there wouldn’t be a scientific explanation

I was and (still am in the winter) a huge fan of the free-ball feeling of boxers.  But even Houston in August didn't defeat the boxer brief!

It was the sweaty kind of day that shorts with inside linings were designed for, to keep the meat separate from the salad and to keep the bread from going soggy, I think we all know that. Out on the driving range I was hitting nothing and missing less. As my rashers peeled off my leg like the side of a fridge, 2 oohs and an ah later I had throbbing of the inside thigh region. Oh captain, my captain, pass me the burt's bees, and on I rubbed, polishing my leg to a eucalyptus shine. 5 minutes later, those rashers became reacquainted with my leg, and I felt my entire body shrivel like a raisin toward the inside of my scrote.

Luckily, no one talks about Fight Club, so the court will never find out.
Accountants don’t make the decisions when it comes to money, they only track where it comes from, how it’s used, and how it affects the company. They create the documents that upper management and investors use to make company decisions. 
To be fair, there have been a number of examples that don't exactly paint a pretty picture of what that type of system might lead to.
Funny how you get downvoted by stating the core principle behind socialism.

Smoking cigarettes or weed? Asking for a friend
The dead can't give permission.
How so? I’ve always learned in my training courses that you multiply the risks in regards to how much smoking increases your risk from asbestos exposure. I just used 5% for each as an example to illustrate my point. 
solution: bury them deeper
Yeah I don't think he was worried about cost, he was 96 years old when I brought it from him two years ago. He aquired the land in 68 and build the house himself in 75. I have found a cast Iron wheelbarrow, oil tanks, gas tanks, a shit load of plastic of different kinds, several old school wooden wheels (the ones before rubber wheels was made popular) and all kinds of stuff. This is old school mentality, just ditch the stuff in a hole or toss it in the forest. One of the oil cannisters had lile half a gallon of engine oil left in it. A foot or so below ground.

The deal was I got to keep everything in the house and workshop(!) if he did not have to clean the place out. Got a lot of valuable tools and cool stuff like aprox. At least 50-70 year old handmade cross countey skis and just a lot of higj quality every day items from the 50's and 60's. All in all I consider it worth it. 
The only way of changing this shit is by criminalizing this behavior with an ability to strip personal assets. For instance, the Sackler family knew that OxyContin was just prescription heroin and they lied and sold it anyways. Regular heroin dealer, you can strip his personal assets and lock his ass upup. These assholes get to be billionaires and let the corporation pay the fines. It’s bullshit.
Well.. except that suddenly closing companies as big and ingrained as 3M would absolutely rock the professional world. We're starting to see higher ups facing jail time more and more though, hopefully that's a trend we can keep up.

Edit: apparently some aren't aware of just how big and important some companies are to modern society. Companies like 3M have made great advancements and produce such high quality products they simply cannot be matched. If they were to be removed they would disrupt everyone's daily life. The truth is that even if you dont care if we went back to the stone age by removing these companies, the great majority of people would, particularly those who benefit from the situation.
There really needs to be a level of individual responsibility within a corporation as well as the board of directors when it comes to things like fraud, social disservice, breaking laws, etc.

It's not about "the company did this", it's about the people within the company that directed the company to do this.  They should be held accountable by law.
Don't be silly, you know how integral 3M is to the modern world?
Same with GE. They have polluted so many locations in the US and just do everything that they can to avoid cleaning up after their careless dumping.

For a second there, I thought the reincarnated emperor of Ethiopia/Messiah got a job with 3M.

Well it's already known that micro plastics are in our food chain. Microwave safe plastics are fine, it's UV rays which cause chemical breakdown. We'll know in a few decades if there are any negative consequences for us consuming it directly. However, things like fish are already observed having a negative impact on health.
Should we go back to metal only? I'm okay with that
It just occurred to me that not only was I confused by people putting baby powder on their balls, but I never actually knew what baby powder  was for to begin with. Thank you.
Off ya go to spend your money on moon pies and penny whistles.
Yes, it smelled of cat urine and bacon too
Seriously, you'll never go back from boxer briefs. I tried boxers again after years and years of boxer briefs and it felt like I was wear a pair of shorts under my pants. I don't know how anyone wears boxers in this era of underpants comfort! 
I hate boxer briefs.  You totally can still get batwing with them but it's even worse.  If I wear boxer briefs they push the batwing back up. So I get the batwing folded over the sack like a bat at rest.  Regular batwing is awkward, folded batwing is terrible.
You don't regret it until after you open and close your legs repeatedly while sitting on a public bus trying to make it happen.
He was asking about his wanger, not the wombles.  
A 5% increase means your rate is 1.05x of normal. If you get two 5% increases multiplicatively your rate becomes 1.05*1.05=1.1025x of normal which is a 10.25% increase.

Now two 50% increases gets you a total 125% increase.
While that may be true, 5% isn't 5. It's 0.05.

A 5% increase (so 105% of the avergae chance) would be 1.05.
> Well.. except that suddenly closing companies as big and ingrained as 3M would absolutely rock the professional world     
    
Good. maybe if we regularly did this and went through with it there would be some pressure by shareholders to cease the inhumane fuckery. Free market at work and all that
Nature abhors a void. Turn them out. Make all their patents public domain. It would be a very minor hiccup. Tons of other companies already at the competitive fringes would gobble up the opportunity.
Maybe if corporations need to be able to poison people's water in order to stay profitable, they should be broken up and prohibited from rejoining.  Break off the successful bits, crush the rest.  

Corporations who pursue profit above the health of the environment or the health of the people working for them in exchange for one tenth of one percent of stock growth that quarter should not exist.
If a company is literally too big to fail it needs to be broken up anyways

Nespresso uses aluminum, not plastic. One of the reasons i prefer it over Kurieg. Bottled water though, yeah that is cancer right there. 
Basically you'd use it in a ton of the places you'd use gold bond medicated powder.  A lot of people prefer baby powder because it doesn't have the cooling mentholated action.  I assume babies would not want mentholated buttholes, but what do I know, I am not a father yet.

The only issue I have is I have to choose between getting a pair that the legs are to loose or a pair with to tight of a waist. Guess I have skinny legs. 
I literally stop talking to people if I find they wear boxers. Fucking inbreds.
Especially those briefs with the pocket up front to keep your little buddies feeling safe and held.

It is like going back into the womb!
my only suggestion then is to cut a hole in an old tennis ball and tuck your nuggets into it.  Then they are cushioned by felt from teh_leg_stick.
I woke up this morning thinking I had basic math down pat. Turns out I do, but I was still in doubt for a second, reading the cryptic replies in this thread. Thanks for clearing it up. 
It's not that it'd rock just 3M, but literally the entire professional world. 

They're a large company with their hands in so many different items almost any sector i can think of would be impacted. They're a base supplier to many, many other industries. 

It's not like shutting down a CPG company (consumer products). That'd still have huge issues, but closing Heinz would have significantly fewer ripples than closing 3m. 


It should be less about the company and the 99% who are innocent, and more about the leaders of ill action. They're the ones collecting the money for their actions and causing mayhem, they should be the ones to pay. If that ends up being a large portion of a company then it will crumble anyways.
You have no idea how many medical supplies 3M makes worldwide... shutting down 3M would be chaos for the healthcare industry, one that would take years for other companies to fill the gap... if they even could. 3M has some seriously advanced manufacturing techniques that literally nobody else has. The closest I could get illustrating this for you is drive your car out to the middle of nowhere and drain all the oil, then try to drive it home, but you can’t stop, you’re only allowed to shout “help, I need oil... as you pass, but you can’t shut your engine off, it’s not allowed... you just have to hope someone can supply the oil while you’re in transit. 
on the one hand i totally agree. on the other hand 3M's products are literally used in almost EVERY other product on the market. it's not like you could just liquidate their holdings and not have major fallout over it. 

most of the stuff around you stays together because 3M actually makes good products. that doesn't mean we should sit back and do nothing, but most people are unaware of how prevalent 3M is. 
Punish huge amounts of innocent people because of a few highly corrupt individuals. Yeah, *so good.*
Isn't that the opposite of free markets? 
> Make all their patents public domain.

This would be far better than a fine for large companies.
Make this a real possibility and watch corporate culture shift gears overnight.
So you just use it do demoisten your junk. I guess my junk has just never needed demoistening

Check [these](https://bonobos.com/products/underwear?color=blue%20floral) boxer briefs from Bonobos. Youo can choose your waist size and they skinny up nice on the legs. They usually have several pairs on sales and they regularly have 30 or 40% on sale items. Got some for ~$14 and they are high quality. Love the H-pouch as well will never go back
I work for a tier 1 auto supplier, if 3m shutdown, our business would grind to an incredibly slow rate as there are few other companies that produce products which meet the specs we need and in the volume we need.

And that's just adhesive foam...
sure, for like 3 months tops as assets and such are liquidated and bought by other companies. Would be a free for all mergers left and right basically. Same shit day to day, different owners, and that first god aweful week of dread wondering if you are getting axed or not.
After a certain point, the original leaders leave.  Should we pursue them and only them forever?  When do we start seeing actual, real punishments for corporations that break the law, but make multiple billions a year across the world?  Just keep giving them fines?

If all some people want is fines, then the fine better fucking hurt.  It should be a total inclusion of the damages, and raised to reflect a portion of the companies' profits for that year, say...5%.  The next time they get fined for the same fucking thing, you square the fine.  They do it again, you put them in debt to the country.  Actual fines that fucking hurt are the only way to have fines matter when it comes to corporations, since a company like 3M can just dab their face with a towel and instantly replace the few hundred million dollar fine it got.  
IDK about you but if I found out I was working for a company that was abusing human rights and had to be completely taken down, my reaction would be to care more about what company I devote my time to instead of blaming the people trying to stop the human right violations.
I never needed it until I joined the military, then it was though God himself blessed my zone after trying it. I use it all the time now if I know I'm going to be walking a lot in the heat, etc. 
But than my weight goes up,  and according to the bmi chart,  I would be obese. 
That's exactly it. I work in packaging and it's the same thing.

Just shows how vast 3m is, even if it's a "small" item no one even knows exists. 
I know this is off topic for the article posted but I would watch the faces people would make as I would tell them that apple was fined for slowing down old phones, and then watch the complete 180 when I told them how much they were fined. 
> instead of blaming the people trying to stop the human right violations.

Where did I advocate for that? That is an Olympics-qualifying leap. There's a multitude of ways to handle this outside shutting down a company of over 91k people. We can stop what's happening, dish out proper punishments, put in place regulation to prevent it going forward, etc. Just because we frequently fail there doesn't mean we need to go overboard, we can just fix that. It's like treating a gangrenous hand by dousing the person with gasoline and lighting him on fire.

And the fact is that you don't know what you would do in these people's shoes. There's just no way to know. Yeah maybe you'd quit a part-time job you picked up on a whim and hate anyways. What about when you've put in 20 years with the company, building up benefits with a salary that actually helps provide for your family? A quick Google search and it looks like a good amount of their employees still have pension plans. It's just as cut-and-dry as you think.

Corruption is a part of business everywhere for all these mega conglomerates that can afford it as a part of doing business. This happens in the EU, US and elsewhere.
This is the same story you hear when any corp is accused of anything in the US.  It's usually code for we're busy shredding everything in the office including furniture and I now nothing.
Siemens is German FYI
Philips is Dutch.
Bribes were tax deductible in Germany until a few years ago, US companies have nothing on Euro companies when it comes to foreign corruption.
The only American company in that list in J&J. The others are German and Dutch iirc
Johnson & Johnson has, in the past, shown integrity. I truly hope that has not changed.

> this is just bad corporate hygiene

I understood that reference.
The office desks know too much, burn them.
They’ve always been fined by US legislation though. Siemens paid out billions in fines a decade or so ago for the same thing.
Fuck everyone should look into Canadian Mining firms. They are some of the largest commodity firms in the world and they run roughshod over Latin America.
US companies ordered South American countries to be invaded over higher taxes.
Thank you. Did not know this. Were you also allowed to funnel dark money to politics? Super PACs can bundle money from unnamed sources and use it to squash opposing political parties. Some small districts had millions poured into races that typically never saw large money contributions. Essentially they bought elections and know one knows who bought them.
They were just linked to knowingly adding asbestos to baby powder... economic integrity maybe?
What's the reference? I just mean that in terms of things like don't commingle personal/business finances, pay "rent" for personal use of company equipment, don't harass the personnel, compartmentalize your risk exposure, etc. Simple things that really don't take much effort that will make sure your "golden parachute" actually opens when you yank the ripcord. Operations get away with bad hygiene until they don't, and when that happens they collapse like a house of cards.
Yup, bribes are no longer tax deductible because of Siemens
Ha, I don't think they were bribing Americans, it was in 3rd world countries.  Made American companies unable to compete, so the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was passed.

Read about the Siemens scandal in the 00s
Look up Tylenol recall
Johnson & Johnson's first products were hygiene products.
Interesting. Thank you 🙏🏻
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter alleges J&J, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharmaceutical, carried out deceptive marking campaigns that downplayed opioids' addictive risks while overstating their benefits.

Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue in March for $270 million and against Teva on Sunday for $85 million, leaving only J&J as a defendant in the nonjury trial before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman.

Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.

I found this somewhat interesting in that there is a comparison between big pharma and the tobacco settlement. What happened with the $246B distribution to the states? The link below is actually very interesting to read how and where money has been spent. Also monies still coming in...for ever.

The Government Accountability Office reported in February 2007 that 22.9 percent of proceeds from the settlement during Fiscal Years 2000 to 2005 had gone to close state budget shortfalls; 7.1 percent had been spent on “general purposes;” and 6 percent on the politically popular term “infrastructure.”  Other notable highlights were that 11.9 percent of funds were “unallocated” and 7.8 percent had been devoted to “Other.”  Barely more than a third of the settlement revenues had been spent on health and tobacco control. 

https://www.cagw.org/thewastewatcher/smoke-what-happened-tobacco-master-settlement-agreement-money
For better or worse, this (deceptive advertising) is all the states can get the pharmacy companies on when it comes to opioids, since they are legal and federally regulated.   
While not opioid specific (but definitely tangentially related), I think states, and the federal government have given up too easily on going after these companies for Medicare/insurance fraud though. Some companies got fined, but the whole rebate system for drugs, between pharmaceuticals and insurance is crooked and needs to go.
I hope they don't settle as well. And if they do settle, I hope every other state follows suite and starts suing as well.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people who legitimately need opioids for pain management are denied treatment and continue to suffer.
Why wouldn't the FDA remove this drug from the market after seeing how bad it was for people?
Big difference between the two. Opioids are FDA approved for certain indications (pain management, etc.). Whereas cigarettes have have an FDA warning against their use and have no "legitimate" positive use.

Edit: interesting points on the allocation of tobacco funds. Reminds me of road repair funding. Taxes for road purposes seem to go up but roads never seem to be repaired.
You do have a good point, but it becomes a lot worse. Yesterday I came upon a separate recent article, it discussed a particular hospital, I believe it was in Massachusetts.

The hospital had been in the red for many years, they decided to hire a new director who had a record of turning poor performing hospitals into cash flow positive in 2-3 years. A offer was made and accepted.

Shortly after taking his position he hired a pain management doctor (going of memory) at $1.4M plus bonus, then a Cardiologist at $1.3M then a OB doctor at $1.2M. Keep in mind this hospital was in deep red and paying these particular doctors a little more than double what other doctors were making at the same hospital performing the same function, why?

Well, these particular doctors had a proven talent, revenue generation. They would order unnecessary tests to be performed within the hospital or a affiliated outside testing source which in turn would give a percentage of revenue back to the hospital for referral.

Within two years the hospital fortunes did a complete recovery from bright red to solid black. 

What happened. Somehow the salary’s of the particular doctors came to light, as did the huge amount of unnecessary tests. Although the article dealt with one hospital, it did mention multiple investigations into other hospitals. The authorities were notified by multiple “whistleblowers”. 

I’ve tried to locate the exact article but haven’t been successful...yet. Below is a link to a very similar situation. This all deals with fraud you had mentioned except it’s much larger.

Reading about these situations just upsets me. We hear all different reasons why the hospitals aren’t making money. Then information like this comes to the top. 

A perfect example is me. I have low blood pressure, normal is 90/40. Frequently I’ll become dizzy getting up. About a month ago I woke up in the morning, I went to coffee, all of a sudden I passed out. I cut my chin which needed 8 stitches and my head hit the tile floor causing a bump on my head.

We go to the ER. They run the standard tests I would have expected blood tests and a CAT scan of my head. They stitched me up CAT scan came back with no major problems. Well the doctor was standing beside me making notes, it’s then he said he was going to admit me for two days for observation and more tests. I actually said, not happening. I felt all they were doing was trying to make money. While I was waiting to receive my discharge paperwork, there were two other patients I overheard the doctor say the same, they were admitting them. All we are now is a car on a used car lot with that aggressive sales person trying to sell us extras we don’t need.

Id guess they settle. Oklomaha will want to ensure it gets money from this and all.
New Jersey checking in. I’ve lost four people in my life to opioids. The problem is catastrophic here
It's disgusting that this got downvoted. This guy is right. In the current "fuck opioids lmao" culture idiots with too much fucking brain rot to do the research about legitimate use cases screaming and stomping their feet demanding they be banned entirely don't understand that there's thousands of people out there who need these medicines to function. I take low dose methadone, and used to take oxycodone ER for a genetic condition that causes chronic, crippling pain. 

Ethical prescribers are getting fucked because people refuse to admit that these drugs have legitimate uses that should not be removed.

Do a little fucking research instead of just parroting the screams of asshole politicians and talking heads
Opiods arent bad, abusive prescribing of opoids is bad, paying doctors to proscribe opoids no matter what is bad, delieberately putting money over safety in medicine...is bad.

Johnson and Johnson thought it get away with it. Maybe it will, but it aint gonna be easy.
Because it has legitimate uses and just removing it from the market would literally kill tens of thousands of people. 

I took Oxy for pain for a while, now I take methadone. I suffer from an extremely painful commission that causes chronic pain, and without opioids would still be in life altering pain every day. 

Like me and my doctor have discussed , the pendulum is now swinging so fucking far because of overzealous legislators and politicians who see demonizing opioids as free points that it's now hurting patients who actually need them. It's disgusting and gross.
All that administration isn't going to administer itself for free.
Formerly Oregon here. I've watched about 20 people I know fall into addiction, only several have died.
Lol, this post gave me such a range of emotions.

Hopefully no one else goes. Maybe we should just put a tarrif on fentanyl.
Jury aside, if you could please refrain from taking talc from asbestos contaminated deposits that would be nice.
So how true is this? Is it like the roundup case, i.e. not based in science?
Strange, I would have expected people cheering that the accusations were all fake news. But I guess its one of those things that will be swept under the rug, like finding out GMO's and MSG aren't bad for you, or that sugar, causes heart disease.
No evidence of this causing cancer. We’ve heard for years that this may not be safe. So it is because it isn’t safe or because we’ve heard it repeated for so many years? as a precaution use corn starch people.
Yes. Entirely. Theres no evidence whatsoever that these cancers were caused by applying baby powder. None at all.
Feels before science.
Interesting. Thanks.

Science by jury is awful and we need to find a way around it.
Good, J&J is shady is so many ways it’s disgusting.
Damn I remember /r/investing siding with JJ so hard. 
Am i fucked in the long run? Grandma use to smother me in this shit (the baby powder) after a bath or shower when i was very young.
Didn’t the Trump administration try or attempt to deregulate asbestos?  
And now they wanna prescribe people diluted ketamine for depression?. Are they even trying anymore
The headline should've mentioned that asbestos was found in the powder. And J&J knew about it for decades and did nothing. Disgusting indeed.
What does a subpoena have to do with taking sides?
cause everyone knows ketamine is the same as asbestos contaminated baby powder.
You comment on the wrong post by chance? 

Chances are the pot you’re grinding up and smoking in your post history is worse for you than the ketamine. 
I worked in a manufacturing plant that did J&J products exclusively. I will never buy anything from them or their different brands - Aveeno, neutrogena, clean & clear, lubriderm and even things like listerine and bandaids. Don’t even get me started on their “baby” line no one should put that on their skin let alone infants. Its all off the list for me along with many others I saw, they’re a straight up door to door car salesman company masquerading as a legitimate brand with a strong R&D team when it’s clearly not the case.

Anyone doing 5 minutes of reading could tell you how and why talc powders are so susceptible to having asbestos and other deadly things in them, so 100% J&J knew. They just didn’t care.

I can’t believe a company that knowingly sells poison is just filed under ‘buyer beware’ and ‘well it happens’. Corporations get all the benefits of being seen as an individual in the eyes of the law, and none of the downsides. If a person sold you poison knowingly on an individual basis you’d bet there’d be a lot more recourse.
Small traces of asbestos were found in the late 60s/early 70s that were very very far below the FDAs limit at the time. 

After that, more stringent processes were put in place to ensure their baby powder never tested positive for asbestos again. If you used it in the past 40 years there’s virtually zero chance of being exposed to asbestos, and even if there were trace amounts in their products (which is a stretch in itself- they have never been found to have *sold* any powder containing asbestos, just that their supplier identified possible asbestos fibers in the late 60s/early 70s), you’re talking about less asbestos than most buildings had floating around in the air at that time. 

I’m curious to see what is found and I don’t hold J&J completely faultless in their handling of this, but I don’t think anything happening here is due to an evil company trying to be as evil as possible (coughnestlecough). 

J&J has a good track record of putting safety over profit (see Tylenol murders in the 90s), so them insisting the baby powder is safe is not nothing. 
It is not taking sides. Jnj has very strong financials and baby products is a fraction of their income. These kind of publicized information lower their stock price and makes it profitable for investors. 

A lot of redditors sided with Johnson and Johnson saying their products didn’t cause cancer and it’s all unproven

But here we are with a subpoena which means 

They dun fucked up
Im so high that was hilarious man
I appreciate what you're saying about the talc powders, but what's wrong with J&J's other products? I couldn't personally find any publicized warnings about their moisturizers or adhesive bandages.
A subpoena means absolutely nothing in context of guilt.

I don’t believe J&J but I don’t think you understand what a subpoena is.
I thought they already discredited those lawsuits as unfounded that it gave them ovarian cancer. I guess people who greedy knows o bounds.
Bad troll is bad, got it. 
The adhesive bandages are the exact same as lower cost brands and are manufactured the exact same. There’s 0 reason to spend more on their brand name. I’ve found other brands like Nexcare to be even better quality when it comes to waterproof bandaids, but in regular scenarios the generic name is fine, since you should be changing your band-aid periodically.

Their moisturizers and lotions are full of fillers that have no benefit and other, cheaper brands have higher quality without the extras such as CeraVe. 

Some of the moisturizers have ingredients that are known to have high allergic reactions, unless you have the textbook definition of both good and resilient skin. And the ingredient list is a good start to understanding what you’re buying but it doesn’t paint the entire picture. A lot of their product ingredients and formulations end up neutralizing the supposed benefit or turn the product highly alkaline, or the addition of perfumes and soaps negates the entire intended benefit of the product. 

The baby line is especially atrocious with the added perfumes being a major ingredient to their products. To me, this is less about things being explicitly poisonous or hazardous. It’s more that they don’t do what they say and in many cases have the opposite effect all while making exaggerated claims they themselves paid to have on their products.
I guess we will see who is guilty in the end

Have a good one man
My aunt died from ovarian cancer after using this product but whatever man.

Have a good day.
Life isnt that hard man. Dad still loves you.
You too.

She died before we could file.

She used the baby powder almost everyday.
So these aren’t the same mesh patches they used for inguinal hernias?
God damn.  I remember the nonstop commercials for the class action.
Still made a huge profit, even if all the states sue for similar amounts
Cool now lets see just how much money they owe for literally poisoning babies with a known carcinogen.
Given the impact on the patients, hopefully this is $9.9 million each.
Apparently not.  From a different article.  

>The surgical mesh devices manufactured and sold by Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are implanted through the vagina and used to treat two conditions in women — pelvic organ prolapse, when organs shift from their normal position, and various urinary issues, including incontinence. These conditions are non-life-threatening and can be treated via multiple, surgical and non-surgical methods.
They aren't the same, but doctors used hernia mesh for this before the specifc transvaginal mesh was created.
Exactly how much profit was made off pelvic mesh?
Simply reading the article would answer your curiosity.
My comment was more for rhetorical flourish than truly believe J&J would compensate people adequately.
Your face is transvaginal mesh.
Am I reading that correctly? $417 million to ONE person? that is the largest payout I've ever heard of to one person as a result of a court case...jesus that is some crazy shit.
Wait, what?

I've been using baby powder on my testicles to prevent sticking for years. Ingredients: talcum powder and fragrance.

Scale from 1 to testicular cancer, how fucked am I?
Even setting the science aside, J&J's defense counsel really fucked up this case. Apparently they decided not to bifurcate the punitive damages phase at trial, even though they have a right to do so in California 

In California, if you bifurcate the trial, first the jury is asked to decide liability and whether the defendant acted with conscious disregard. If they say yes, then they are given information about the defendant's financial condition and are asked to decide on the amount of punitive damages.

If you don't bifurcate, the jury makes both decisions at the same time. And the jury is given access to the defendant's financial info before they've even decided liability. That is a recipe for a runaway jury. Idiots.

As a woman... wtf is she powdering everyday since 1950?! 

I just can't imagine.. her whole body? The the bits? Why?! 
They have the money, lawyers and resources to drag the shit out of this in appeals. It'll be a long time before they write that check.
What doesn't give you cancer? Honestly. 
Off to appeals you go.
And the thing is, there is no scientific evidence that talcum powder causes cancer, just a jury that was convinced there was a link.
Does this mean I should stop putting Gold Bond on my balls after every shower?

You could build a machine that rips people's arms off and pay less to the victim than that. 
Then they appeal for ten years and it gets reduced to 20 million they appeal again til almost all the victims are dead. Typical American corporate justice
this site is garbage and instantly shows me trump garbage and ONE sentence that is the title
No amount of money will un-cancer anyone unfortunate enough to develop it by using the baby powder.
How did they prove it was the talcum powder? As far as I know there have been several studies showing it is safe.
The link just produces the headline with no story. Is there a link to the story?
Not a dollar for everyone whose suffered from their " no tears " BS ....
Somehow I still think I'll be seeing 

"known to the state of California to cause cancer" on these labels... 
My question is why and how are they still able to sell this? I've bought baby powder in the last year, no warnings of any kind on the bottle. 
So should I stop powdering my nuts every morning? 
Is this the lawsuit where the chick got cancer because she thought it was safe to jam talcum powder into her vagina every day?
I don't know why J&J has the lawsuit when there is talcum powder in everyday soaps of other brands. I must have lathered on that talcum powder soap, from another company, for over a decade. I wouldn't be surprised if the jury bathed with talcum powder in their soap too. 
Can someone ELI5 l...is the powered on the shelves today a different formula than this ?
Johnson & Johnson the FAMILY COMPANY!
🤢
Weird. I've know for at least 30 years that talcum powder is cancer causing.
Good grief, the danger of talcum powder was known in the 70s. I was under the impression that every maker had switched to corn starch or other substitutes. 
It doesn't say anything else. 
Linking only worth 417. Lawyers getting lazy 
wait, first i hear this causes cancer

especially ovarian cancer? how does it even... get in there?
in these types of lawsuits how does one prove they used the product x amount of times or for x amount of years? do they just save their receipts for everything on the off chance something pops up? and if so, whenever i save a receipt typically within a year or less the ink on the receipt is no longer legible in most areas.
They've been saying this stuff causes cancer since I was a kid in the 70s.  But I always thought it was just some crazy folk, like those fluoride folks.  So Johnson & Johnson will probably just slap a Prop 65 warning on it like everyone else does.

Use this in the shop for installing rubber bushings.
So, I use it as a cheap substitute to dry shampoo. How fucked am I?
Ladies don't put sand in your clam, and weird shit won't happen. 
Now I'm understanding a little better why the J&J CEO was one of the last to leave Trump's manufacturing leaders board. 
Most will go to lawyers
It says there are almost 5000 similar cases. Why wouldn't this be a class action instead?
So many of us women used talcum powder on how hoo-has.  They need to pay.
Is this about that idiot who put talcum powder on her vagina?
[removed]
You are correct! Crazy, right? They will appeal it, of course. The last amount they awarded was $110.5 to a VA woman. In both cases, it was major long term usage - like 20+ years etc. 

There are more trials pending too! Given J&J's corporate position as the world's most trusted brand, you'd think this would hurt them but the online news chatter about this is minimal (eclipsed, if you will, ha).
Another dude who just did an AMA last week, served 21 years for a crime he didn't commit, and the state gave him just over $2 million.
Yeah, and she was using massively excessive amounts of it. It's kind of like suing God because you drank to much sea water and died. 
[deleted]
I tried to use baby powder under my boobage and would get these huge boil/cyst-like bumps.  It clogged my pores, and I'm guessing my sweat glands, something fierce.  I wish there was another solution.
The issue is ovarian cancer, not cancer in general, so you're fine. 
Use cornstarch.

The talcum powder one shouldn't even be on the market.
i've tried to search out the peer review on this shit. i've come up pretty empty. the closest thing i could find is that asbestos is sometimes found in talcum powder. asbestos causes lung cancer, specifically mesothelioma, which is a cancer affecting the lining of the lung. the way it causes that is the asbestos fibers are REALLY REALLY fine, but also sharp and relatively hard. which allows the fibers to pierce the cells in the lung lining easily. the fibers are so fine that when they pierce the cell the cell stays in tact, but the fibers start to interrupt mitosis. the fibers literally get in the way of the dna as it's replicating. i guess the best way to describe it is the dna is kind of like a slinky, when the cell divides the slinky kind of gets all jumbled up and then splits into 2 new slinkies. well the asbestos is like jamming an iron rod into the jumbled up slinkies so when they split they the slinkies are deformed. with the deformed dna you end up sometimes with cancer.

now is there fear that the talcum powder would give you testicular cancer or something? unlikely. it's harmful for the lungs because you breathe it in. skin cells are a bit hardier than the lining of your lungs. 

now as for this lady as far as i know she got ovarian cancer because she used talcum powder for her crotch area. maybe the talcum got up there and some of the asbestos went up there too and that caused the ovarian cancer? i suppose that's possible. in your case maybe if you slapped the talcum near your tip and some of it went into your penis and got way in deep down your vas deferens you might have an issue. i dunno the science for it is pretty sketchy if you ask me. people get ovarian cancer for any number of reasons. how likely is it that she got it from talcum powder? i have no idea. like i said i had trouble finding peer reviewed papers on the subject. at least ones that aren't behind a paywall. maybe someone who has access to those would have a better idea.
Zero. There's no peer-reviewed science linking baby powder to cancer.
Was just about to ask this, I think our balls our fine tho. Powder on . 
That's not how cancer works. But I would say you are more fucked than someone who didn't use it. Even if it's the slimmest of margins.
I wouldn't use something with fragrance regularly, long-term, in such a sensitive area. Maybe you should consider a fragrance and dye free alternative. In regards to the ovary cancer link, I'd think it would be good caution to avoid getting the powder in your pee hole or other orifices, as the powder is likely to similarly embed its self in sensitive internal tissues causing chronic inflammation that may lead to cancers down the road.

Hi there - I got testicular cancer, and have never used baby powder down low in my life.  Anecdotal/YMMV?
It's always fascinating hearing of another profession's fantastic fuck up.
I thought the recipe for Runaway Jury was John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and a John Grisham novel. 
When in doubt always bifurcate 
Thank you, all I see is the headline. 
Most of our clients did this, it was marketed as a feminine hygiene product for the perineal region for decades. 
Because it's sterile and I like the taste.
Right? I can't imagine powdering my vulva to the extent I get enough in my vagina, up through my cervix, into my uterus, into my fallopian tubes, to get imbedded in my ovaries in quantities sufficient enough to get cancer.

That's a lot of powder. 


My mother has powdered herself after every shower for as long as I can remember. She says it helps her dry off faster I guess. Fricken powder everywhere, everyday.
Yes, the the bits.
Latest study showed that 1/3 of cancers are a result of natural mistakes in cell reproduction, if i remember correctly. Although it is safe to say that introducing poisons to the body will result in cell/dna destruction, which can then lead to the mistakes mentioned above. 
Very true. However, it's different when someone knows that their product might give you cancer and still actively tries to sell it to you anyway.
There is scientific evidence that talc can become embedded in ovaries, and that it causes inflammation. Chronic Inflammation is known to cause cancer. 

Part of the evidence for this case was the genetics of the plaintiff which indicated that she had no history of ovarian cancer in her family. Another part of the evidence was electronic scanning microscope images of the talc embedded at the center of the tumor. 

Furthermore, over $300m of this award was for punitive damages. Johnson and Johnsons internal documents show that they've known about the link between the mineral talc and ovarian cancer since the 80s. Their own scientists warned them, they ignored them. They then proceeded to market talc to African Americans because they used it more often, and now African Americans have a higher rate of ovarian cancer than any other demographic. Because Johnson and Johnson tried to cover it up they now have a serious litigation on their hands. 

I worked on these cases for a year when I was at Weitz and Luxenberg. If you have any questions let me know. 
Then I guess the people that represented Johnson and Johnson really fucked up.
So it's still safe to use for... lubrication purposes?
You mean those infomercials do not have you convinced of it yet?
Nearly everything causes cancer according to California.

> California’s regulatory bar is set so low that the label law applies to any product containing a chemical with a 1 in 100,000 chance of causing cancer in a person exposed to the product over 70 years

Stop repeating this lie. Wherever you are getting it from, doesn't understand the rules of evidence and was probably written by a company stooge from the talc industry.
do your balls have ovaries?
They'll appeal and it'll be reduced by 99% or so, which is typical. They still have at least 2200 cases to deal with so it's a shit ton of money. The appeal process will take about a year.

There is no additional news yet (I keep looking!), AP just broke the story. I'll post a link here as a reply as soon as full text comes up.
Giant sums like this are usually punitive.
When I worked on these cases we obtained the pathology slides and blocks from the hospital as well as the images from the electron scanning microscopes and at the center of the tumor is the talc particles, indicating the tumor originated around the talc. 

There are several dozen studies linking talc to cancer through chronic inflammation. Imerys, the company that mines and manufactures the talc, puts warning labels on the bags that they sell to Johnson and Johnson that say the product may cause ovarian cancer. Johnson and Johnson literally takes the label off and puts it on the shelf. 
"Studies" paid for by J&J
Apparently the offending ingredient isn't in the UK talc anymore but still in the US talc.
I *believe* they fixed the formula and took talc out. 
No, talc is a mineral. The only thing Johnson and Johnson adds is 1% by volume fragrance. 
J&J Baby powder in my area is corn starch now

Its only dangerous if you use a massively excessive amount of it over a long period of time. Although there was no warning on the bottle, it should be common sense that it was for external use only.
Fascinating. Please provide some links to peer-reviewed studies so I can learn more.

If I recall correctly, the powder effects internal tissues. As long as you didn't breath in the stuff like a coal miner, you should be fine. 
Actually commission for these cases is 33% plus expenses, so you're wrong. 
Sweetheart, you can say pussy on Reddit. Reddit is all about pussies.

They paid in this case because they *knowingly* promoted talc even after research showed it had the potential to cause cancer. I've often wondered why this company is so Teflon. 
Completely deserved considering how hard they're trying to squash evidence relating the two. Shame on them. 
How is this their fault? People have been using talcum powder for forever.
Yeah, there is a massive PR machinery at work that is hired to ensure news like this is eclipsed. 
I remember hearing about this case in an ethics class I wondering if in fact the women might have hpv which could of caused the cancer.
I could've sworn I heard that they were using it for their vaginas
Can i too get some a lawyer and sue a company to get that amount if money? Ill give him a partial amount 
Well, their president is a known child rapist, so I don't know about "most trusted".
God doesn't own the sea and has no money. Did J&J provide a warning to consumers that excessive use could lead to cancer? Was there any kind of warning at all about using too much?
Or drank massive amounts of aspertame sweetener
Or being cheap and buying your fiance the low quality wedding invitation letters and making her lick and seal each one.... george...
No. I worked on these cases, and the commission is 33.3%. If the client gets no money then the firm gets no money. You don't know what you're talking about, so please don't comment bullshit.

Ha! Joke's on you! My ovaries *are* my testicles!
[removed]
I don't know about the US, but talcum powder in Canada is all cornstarch not talc.  Has been for many many years.
The closest thing I could find is [this peer-reviewed article](http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/6/8/811.long) which doesn't specifically look at talc, but at genital powders in general.
Doesn't mean there is no link, only that we don't know of a link.  So he's probably got a small chance of developing it.
Lack of sufficient research is not proof of a lack of link between talcum powder and cancer. There's only research where there's money. 
There's plenty of papers. What are you talking about? Talc causes chronic inflammation when it becomes embedded in the tissue of the ovaries, chronic Inflammation causes cancer. If you look at the pathology you'll see the talc particles at the center of the tumors. You don't know what you're talking about. 
I don't know what to believe now. I stopped using it cause of the previous case and I miss the dry smoothness.
> To prove conclusively that talc causes ovarian cancer would require a randomized clinical trial - the gold standard of scientific proof. But that is not possible because of ethical concerns, Cramer said.
> Such a trial would need to deliberately expose women to a product thought to cause cancer and wait to see if they developed ovarian cancer at higher rates than women not using the product.

Nonetheless:

> Mishori said she does not believe there is any proof through "rigorously conducted, high-quality studies that there is a causation or even an association" between talc and ovarian cancer. As a doctor, she is pragmatic, noting that talc-based powder is not a must-have product. 

> "If you are concerned, just don't use it," she said.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/
That's false. So, piss off.
Or just switch to corn starch. 
 I mean what isn't available with prime these days. Even in canada I buy everything but groceries from amazon. All with prime 2 day.
"Hi honey, how was work?"

"Well remember how one manager hushed up the problems with Challenger that led to it blowing up?"

"Yes."

"Well I made a mistake that almost beats that financially."
so meta
Not my method of birth control, but I believe women used to use powder on diaphragms, at least I remember my mother keeping hers in a container of baby powder, and modern instructions for diaphragm use indicate to not use baby powder on them.

Pretty sure that's where the ovarian cancer risk comes from.
Sorry, what about your vulva?
I feel like moisture+ powder = cakey mess.
Do you feel that a courtroom and jury are a better place to establish a direct scientific link, as has been attempted to do in this case, than actual medical scientific studies?

The reasoning is indirect, as you yourself acknowledge there.  What do you think about your efforts to establish a link when the scientific evidence is spotty, at best?  Do you feel that this has a bearing on potential lawsuits in the future that aren't directly supported by scientific evidence, but rather, inferences?
[deleted]
Okay but are my balls safe? I like gold bond.
I am so glad that an actual attorney who knows what they are talking about is in this thread.
Oh, please.  Cramer's work (which is what J&J "has known about since the 80's") has been shown to be biased, and he was a paid consultant for the plaintiffs attorneys.  More recent studies, including one which Cramer was a co-author, showed "little support for any substantial association between perineal talc use and ovarian cancer risk overall." The rest is race baiting.  It's no wonder people are distrustful of scientists, when they can be bought, like Cramer, and hailed as lone voices against the cacophony of industry.  To the glory and riches of Weitz and Luxenberg.
[removed]
Does all of this money go to this single lady? If it's punishment why not have the government take most of the money and hold onto it to help others who get this cancer from the product?
this would be a good AMA
> Their own scientists warned them, they ignored them.

So being in this field of work i can tell you that lawyers may say this because at some point in development of a project, one person might has said at some point that something may be cancerous before testing is done.  Usually they then test and show it is safe but if even one person fucks up and said it might have the possibility of being unsafe because of possible structure than it comes back and bites them since the lawyers point at it and say "well this guy said it might be unsafe,  So it IS unsafe" and that's what they use for the legal argument. 
[deleted]
They should have hired expert redditors instead. They'd have won for sure. Science.
Talcolm powder is not a very good lubricant.
I have, and *all* these documents show only a hypothetical, and completely unproven, link between *any* health problems, including from inhalation.  Essentially what these documents show is that there is a risk of talc use because someone said so, not because there was any evidence of it.  This points to one of the problems that the general public has with the scientific process: A theory or hypothesis is a supposition or proposed explanation for something that is based upon limited (or none) evidence as a *starting point* for further investigation.  "Talc causes ovarian cancer" is a *hypothesis* that (so far) has no basis in *fact*.
There is no scientific consensus on this issue.  It may be carcinogenic but there is simply not enough evidence yet to rule out other causes.  This jury was sympathetic to this woman's case but just because the jury sided with her doesn't mean talc is carcinogenic.
Does the powder defintely cause cancer?
I'll see you back here in a year. The appeals process will still be going on and they won't have paid a dime of the settlement
$71*B*illion in profits for 2016 alone:
https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-2016-fourth-quarter-results

$471*M*illion is basically a week's earnings and affects them not at all.  It's the equivalent of a speeding ticket.
Can you link some of these studies?
You've claimed the warning label several times, but I think you're actually talking about the MSDS sheet. Is that correct? If so, can you please link to that?
Is this proven or are you speculating?
I bought a bottle in late 2016 and it still has talc as first ingredient 
I was being facetious 
That's interesting.  My mom never bought talcum powder and she used to say it was because it would give you lung cancer.  Now I know why she thought that. 
Interesting. I learned specifically not to put talcum powder on your face from a monster make-up book I read in the eighties, and I am almost certain the book was published in the 70s. 
The problem in the seventies was that talcum powder contained *aspestos* (!) in those days. 

https://www.asbestos.com/blog/2014/08/05/talcum-powder-cancer/
i mean... was it ever said to be for internal use? or does it just travel?
In case that last bit wasn't rhetorical:

1. 131 years old.
2. Top 10 largest market cap.
3. Empire of dozens of household brand names, which in and of itself bears the prerequisite of best-in-the-world public relations operation.

They know exactly how to manipulate the public's attention.
To be fair, the Tylenol murders really weren't their fault.
No matter what you think of J&J this is a marginal case that does nothing to advance human health and well-being.  The ex post facto litigation of these types of cases is purely just pouring money from big pharma into the pockets of sleazy lawyers.   First off, it is possible that asbestos containing talc may possible be carcinogenic, however that talc hasn't been available in the US since 1970.  The scientific consensus on talc as a carcinogen is that it isn't.   Therefore it is not possible to provide warnings about risk if there is no good evidence that there is a risk.  Yet another example of why science should not be debated in a court since this is, at its core, a scientific question.

Except there is almost no evidence talc causes cancer
I actually worked for six years at this company and i have to tell you that they are very open about this kind of shit. They denounce themselves before it blows up in the press so that is how they avoid negative publicity. And also very good PR people.
Hey, at least cancer finally has a positive effect. We can use baby shampoo.
Potential and linking are pretty flimsy words.
Hundreds of millions for PR firms sure helps.  Plus the billions in revenue while still selling the carcinogen helps even more.  
Is there some, you know, actual science connecting baby powder to cancer?
The link is minor at best. This judgement is extremely poor
Yeah I remember seeing trucks driving around New Brunswick with some website (like J&J Truth or something like that) that was all about raising awareness for this baby powder thing. An interesting note to add:  the truck was very thin and solely used as a moving billboard.
thanks, capitalism
I think, and might be remembering this wrong, that they were aware of it, and did nothing or tried to hide it.
And mixed with news that there is no link to cancer. 
You can't just drop that in there without a source.
I think blasting anything up your coochie for a 20 year period will give you cancer. To counter your question...Is the intended purpose of baby powder to be use as a feminine care product? 
What about breathing.... did anybody warn you that simply breathing might lead to inhalation of this, that, or the other elements which might cause some long-term, long delayed, issue?
>has no money

True, but he can create money out of thin air, which is definitively better. I'd be going for an indefinite time period on the judgement
Last time I checked there was no reputable science linking baby powder and cancer. This is lawsuit is on the order of anti-vaxxers and anti-GMO crap.
This is the problem with our society. People simply don't use common sense. Using too much of anything can lead to something bad.
The fact that one person in all of history over used the stuff and caused cancer suggests the one person is at fault.
What about like Zues or Aquaman. Still no warning on saltwater. I think there is a case.
If you drink enough water, it will kill you. I suppose there's some onus on the company providing a product to list safe exposure or dosage levels, but at some point it becomes silly for a company to figure out the LD50 for a candy bar. 
at least he was happy
We need more redditors like you. Well done
At 33.3% thats close to 140million for your firm and I'm curious...do you get a cut of that or do you simply go home happy that you told a big corporation to go fuck itself? lol
Worked for an attorney that took 43% of mass tort civil cases. He was a real asshole.
Thank you! I work at a product liability firm and talcum powder is a product I work on, your exactly right! 
1/3 plus expenses

It's essentially totally different.  One is tiny rocks.  The other one is an organic chemical in powder form. 
I heard gold bond is good for nether regions and armpits. Might work for underboobs too.
No no
That comes after the cancer

/r/jesuschristreddit
Tiny particle inhalation is linked to cancer. If not in enough scientific studies for some, still far more strongly than virtually everything else you hear causes cancer.
Simply existing caries a 50% chance of developing cancer. I'll take those odds. I like gold bond.
No but it's proof that there is reasonable doubt.

Although J&J are pretty scummy about it being they have known there could be a problem for a long time but have failed to fund a study to make sure their product isn't potentially deadly. In this case I'm glad they were punished but also not glad how.

Part of the payout should go towards that study I was talking about.
Which, if you don't have ovaries such as OP heavily implied due to usage on his testicles, leaves you still with zero evidence linking it to cancer and uncertainty about whether or not it's safe.
There are talc-free alternatives. 
So, you're saying you agree with me? 

Regardless, thanks for the link - that was interesting.
"What fuckup did you do today?"  
"I ad-libbed an empty threat to a nuclear armed dictator."
Wow. That would make sense I suppose. 


Right? Pretty sure that's how you make biscuit dough..
Yeah its definitely one of those edge situations where there is evidence that it MAY cause cancer, but the link is indirect.

The argument is similar to the argument for the mesothelioma and asbestos cases. 

Before cases go to court they have to pass something called daubert. That means that there must be enough plausible scientific evidence according to experts for a link to be established. This case passed daubert, so I think it's fine. I was personally directly involved with compiling the research related to talc and ovarian cancer, and I while I wouldnt say it's indisputable, I'd say it's more than likely that talc is causing the cancer in these clients. Another issue is that Johnson and Johnsons own scientists warned them about the link in the 80s, and they ignored them. Additionally, the manufacturer of the talc, Imerys, puts labels on the talc that it may cause cancer. Johnson and Johnson literally removes those labels, adds 1% fragrance by volume and puts it on the shelf. 
>Do you feel that a courtroom and jury are a better place to establish a direct scientific link, as has been attempted to do in this case, than actual medical scientific studies?

Courtroom Science testimony has to follow certain laws and ethical issues. You can't just bring in a ringer who is an "expert" in whatever bullshit science they're trying to peddle.

http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/ieee/ieee29.htm

It's actually a pretty deep subject that doesn't get anywhere enough public attention.
If I understand my companies policy correctly, it's illegal to do that so we don't.  We are required to keep them for X years where X is based on what type of document it is.  If I remember correctly, lab data is stored for 7 years, but I don't have to worry about it precisely because the database handles all of that automatically. 
It's a good question that I don't know the answer to. I can only guess that if they somehow got caught they would get sued into oblivion and no longer exist. 
If it came to light that they actively destroyed documents on this subject, people would believe they were 100% true even if they turned out to be false.
You know what lawyers generally aren't?

Scientists.

There are *some* case-controlled (not randomized controlled, a much higher standard) trials that suggest a link, and there are more that don't.

Most of the positive studies have been done by a single researcher who has pretty much made a career out of this and gets paid to go over this research at these trials.  There's plenty of reason to be skeptical.

The fact that liability in cases this scientifically rigorous is put before a jury of 12 random people is honestly a failing of the American justice system to keep pace with research.
Cramer was a consultant for J&J in the 1980's and he warned them that there was a risk of cancer from the talcum. They ignored him. Of course the plaintiff would want him involved since he was a consultant for J&J.
So which Johnson are you?
Just don't shove a handful up your vagina for 20 years and you'll be fine.

It's amazing how the actual science got lost in this case.
Yes, we asked our clients to keep as many bottles as possible. Otherwise if there is no pathology then the only evidence available that you used talc is your word, and that's not enough. 
It would be a great AMA but a quick look at the blowback that OP is getting here there is probably no way that will ever happen. Are people resentful that someone won a huge payout? Do they not believe science? Are the folks invoking anti-vaxxers Pro Corporationists (made up word)?

I do not get it.
Punivite damages are *beyond* the plaintiff's experienced damages. The point of punitive damages is to punish the company. Thus, it needs to be at amount that the company actually notices and is punished. Quite frankly, companies deal with numbers orders of magnitude higher than the average person. Thus, punitive damages often end in absurd judgements or settlements.
There is no medical consensus that it does not.

Juries don't arive a a nine figure punative damage award based on sympathy. The jury was penalizing the defendant for having known about the probable link to cancer and concealing it.
the "science"  behind it is pretty questionable from what I've read.  There's a lot of "These people have CANCER, they deserve money!" type emotions.

It's just all too reminiscent of the "silicone breast implants" judgement that put Dow Corning in to bankruptcy and paying billions in judgements, and years later virtually everyone admits there was never any issue with the impants.

Science doesn't move at the speed of lawsuits unfortunately.
How many times can they appeal? isn't there a limit on how many times you can do it?
Except J&J do a hell of a lot more than talcum powder.  All it has to do is put a dent in the talc sales.  

Also, speeding tickets do a pretty good job of stopping egregious speeding, and that's the point!  Saying that it's the equivalent of a speeding ticket is saying that it's working as intended.
>$71Billion in profits for 2016

That's revenue. Profits = earnings.
This case doesn't prove anything either way. A jury's opinion is that the powder causes cancer. 
You can still buy some with talc. They also have a talc free formula. 
So your nether regions don't chafe and are also fireproof!

That and tge Tylenol murders was not their fault at all. They actually recalled all their medicine taking a financial hit and invented tamper proof seals on medicine to stop crazy people from popping open pull bottles and slipping poison in them at stores.
Also I'm sure they have so much firepower with any news outlet since they are a major advertiser and sponsor. Bad press = no more J&J ad dollars. 
>The scientific consensus on talc as a carcinogen is that it isn't.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, is that perineal use of talc-based powder is "possibly carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence of a link to ovarian cancer in humans." 

https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol93/mono93.pdf

Also, analysis of the tumor showed embedded talc. The patient also had no genetic predisposition or family history of ovarian cancer. Add on to that J&AJ ignoring warnings from their own experts and their failure to provide warnings on a product comprised almost entirely of talc *despite the supplier of said talc labeling it as potentially carcinogenic* and you have a case that was far from marginal. The is fairly strong evidence that this particular case was caused by talc exposure, and Johnson & Johnson knowingly and willfully neglected to inform their customers of the potential risks.


Not OP, but here you go:

https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol93/mono93.pdf
> I don't know why you would choose to not source this claim.

Because frankly my interest is in their communications/reputation, not the science. 
How much evidence is needed to award four hundred million dollars?
International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) - Talc-based body powder for perineal dusting: 2B – Possibly carcinogenic to humans. 
I agree - they take the air out of the balloon and it's very well done. But there has been issue after issue in the last decade and it never seems to even touch their reputation. 

I hope they bonus their PR people well. 
Asbestos is sometime found with talc deposits.

In a word: no.

Edit: I see your comments through the thread trying to shake some evidence out.  Although I have not personally done a literature review on the subject, from what I have heard is that there is no dose response effect with talcum powder, most studies have been done with standard powder and not asbestos removed talcum powder.  Even those that do use the correct stuff rely on people remembering exactly how much they used decades ago.

In short, there is an insufficiency of scientific legs to stand on, so hell, let's go to court!  Another stupid example of science being debated in a court of law.  Jeez.
Pretty much any fine particles you breath is bad 
from what i have read, the cancer was on the cervix (?) because they put powder on the outside of the vagina.
> https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html

not baby powder, talc.  I say that because there are non-talc alternatives.

https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html
Yeah, seems crazy when it's not even proven.
You kid yourself if you think any economic system doesn't give power to those with money.
Tried to hide what? That there is no evidence that talc causes cancer?
But I just did... 

EDIT: Just kidding. Here's a [source](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-07/news/sns-rt-us-usa-wisconsin-billionaire-20140606_1_sexual-assault-charge-wisconsin-billionaire).

Not quite. Baby powder, talc, causes inflammation when it embeds itself in the extremely sensitive tissue of the ovary. This causes an inflammatory response. Inflammation is a known cause of cancer. 

Our firm would obtain the pathology from the hospital, if still preserved, and ask for the slides and images from the electron scanning microscope. These slides and images show the talc particles at the center of the tumor, deep inside. 

So the science isnt quite on the same level as anti gmo crap, it makes sense and is more than plausible. It's difficult to rule out genetic causes of cancer, so clients are also required to get a BRCA test to determine their susceptibility to developing ovarian cancer naturally. 
prob cause no one is looking at the effects of jamming random shit up your ass for 20+ years.
But how much is too much
How would you use common sense on a powder with no specified limit on usage? 
> Using too much of anything can lead to something bad.

I would still like to know what the actual side efforts.

> and caused cancer

No evidence for that being the case.
I was referring to the studies on aspartame that found that rats who developed cancer from it were force-fed a dose of it so large that the average human would become extremely sick and potentially fluid poisoned before they could consume the amount necessary in the timespan used.  

A conscious and converted effort would have had to be made to reach the proportional dosage.  
Depends on the firm. If you're a senior partner you'll get a percentage after the firm pays payroll, rent etc. If there are a lot of lawyers though then every lawyer gets a bonus, percentages vary widely. Sometimes paralegals get bonuses too, again it depends on the firm. My firm had 90+ lawyers though so there were no bonuses unless you were the lead lawyer. 

99% of the time it's like you said, you go home knowing you fucked a massive corporation during a 5+ year battle and you get paid well to do it. 

However, this was a jury decision. It will absolutely be reduced. My old firm won a couple thousand cases related to Actos and the jury decision was over $1 billion. It was reduced by 99%, which is fairly typical. Still a lot of money though. I'd expect this to be reduced by 99% as well, no one wants these corporations to go bankrupt because they create an enormous amount of jobs and economic productivity. We just want them to be held accountable when they fuck up, and we want them to stop fucking up. 
Yeah, such dirt bags for helping people and asking for a fee to do so. Tell me, would you rather this lady have 66% of the payout or 0%? What's better, in your opinion? She's free to represent herself you know. I worked my ass off at Weitz and Luxenberg on these exact cases, I guess I'm a dirt bag. 
my baby powder has "corn starch and fragrance" listed under ingredients...

thats why I suggested she try corn starch over baby powder.

Regardless,I just hope it helps her breast sweat.
Lol oh come off it we all know that they meant the "function" was essentially the same, not that they were molecularly related.
Is that what people mean when they say "you got rocks in your socks?"
> an organic chemical in powder form.

so tiny organic rocks?
Gold Bond is also made with Talc.

Talc has been found in a small number of studies to possibly be linked to ovarian cancer. So far there have been no cases of negative effects on men. I believe it has to be used near the vagina to cause and issue.

However, to play it safe, why not use a product designed for women like Summer's Eve? No talc And it does basically the same thing.
Try the gold bond ultimate body powder stuff. That one is made with corn starch instead of talc. Works well for me
I know right!? There could be kids reading this!
Unless you live in California, then it's a 100% chance of getting cancer.
Reasonable doubt applies to criminal court. This was a civil case where the standard is preponderance of the evidence (something was more likely to have happened than to have not).
Pretty much haha, sometimes I just like to add extra info for anyone else that's reading the thread that adds a bit of context or background
Wait a second
J&J did but an effort into moving to corn starch in the 80's.  Shower to Shower brand had it.
What would you suggest as the solution? 12 "scientists" that carry their own bias into the jury room? Let's not forget these folks get a paycheck from somewhere, large companies tend to have the ability to directly/indirectly fund R&D and would therefore over represent the interest of a large company. And how would we start defining scientist? Would it be on education, job title or knowledge regarding the subject matter? 

Plug it all into a black box computer and out pops an answer? Maybe goat entrails.

The standard in a civil case is not "beyond a reasonable doubt". The verdict is not a statement of scientific fact. It's really just saying 12 people think J&J is much more likely responsible than not responsible.

The failure is not the system, it's more fundamental .. the systems humans have built were built to suit the needs of human (which is different than a system built to suit the truth)


Well in this case I have degrees in both biology and environmental science, and prior to law school I worked as an environmental scientist. So I am a scientist. 

Also lawyers use experts in their cases, and they bring them in to testify and refute other experts testimony. Lawyers aren't the ones explaining medical studies. 

I know who you're talking about and he is considered an authority on the subject, but there are actually several dozen reputable studies out there from the US, Europe, Canada and Australia that support the plaintiffs argument. 
There isn't going to be a randomized controlled study on whether or not talc causes ovarian cancer because that's not the type of thing that you can do a randomized controlled study of in humans. In this instance case controlled studies are probably as good as it's going to get.
Fascinating. Please provide links to his peer-reviewed studies so I can read more. 
[removed]
The criteria is actually more like at least 5 years of continued use multiple times  a week. Many of our clients used it every day for decades. 

It's amazing how some redditors who glanced at the science and litigation think they know more than attorneys who have multiple science degrees and have been working on this case for years. 
Seems like that would be "enough" judging by the standards of this case considering that no hard evidence was shown to prove a concrete link between the powder and the cancer. 
Well the client doesn't deserve the award and neither does the government.  How about cut a check for $1 to each citizen?
The argument that "just because you can't prove/disprove X makes my belief in Y just as valid" is a logical fallacy.  The jury was sympathetic to the woman's case, whether talc causes cancer or doesn't is irrelevant to this entire trial because the jury has no more knowledge about the potential carcinogenic properties of talc than anyone else.
I'm sure it's karma for asbestos.
Twice usually. To higher courts. Filing motions which stall the legal process. It's been done before by corporations with regularity 
Friction starts fires!
LOL, I thought you were talking about cornstarch, and started to write, 

"Have you ever tossed a handful of corn starch over a fire?"

Powdered sugar is pretty good, too. 
wow... i'm just imagining it turning to cement up in there now...

in any case i tend not to be on corporate side for these things but i don't see how it's their fault here; might be more to this
I hear what you're saying, but the company the Johnson & Johnson gets the talc from labels it as potentially carcinogenic. Johnson & Johnson then mixes in a bit of fragrance and packages the talcum powder *without* warnings of the potential carcinogenic risks. Combine that with ignoring warnings from their own experts, and you have a clear pattern of knowing and willful obfuscation of the potential risks. That's what seals it for me. They chose to potential put their customers at risk because they knew cancer warning labels would be bad for the sales of a product primarily marketed for use on babies.
The case is marginal at best.  WHO has clearly stated that the evidence is weak, the data derives mostly from case-control studies which are some of the weakest forms of medical evidence.  Further, even in that older monograph there is no statement that it is a carcinogen only that it may be a possible carcinogen - please note that that statement means that there is not enough definitive evidence to call it a carcinogen.    The basis for this statement is that some studies show that it may be, however many other studies show no association.  Numerous, more recent  papers than that monograph, have re-evaluated this question using better statistical methods and considering all the evidence.  Some of these are behind a pay wall.

* 1. Epidemiology. 2016 Nov;27(6):797-802. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000528.

Conclusions: There was little association between baseline perineal talc use and subsequent ovarian cancer (HR: 0.73, CI: 0.44, 1.2).  ... Douching but not talc use was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer in the Sister Study.


  
* 2. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014 Sep 10;106(9). pii: dju208. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dju208. Print 2014 Sep.

Conclusions:
Among 61576 postmenopausal women, followed for a mean of 12.4 years without a history of cancer or bilateral oophorectomy, 52.6% reported ever using perineal powder. Ever use of perineal powder (hazard ratio [HR]adj = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87 to 1.28) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use. Individually, ever use of powder on the genitals (HRadj = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.36), sanitary napkins (HRadj = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.20), or diaphragms (HRadj = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.23) was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with never use, nor were there associations with increasing durations of use. Estimates did not differ when stratified by age or tubal ligation status.  Based on our results, perineal powder use does not appear to influence ovarian cancer risk.

* 3. Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Mar;23(3):513-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9894-5. Epub 2012 Jan 14.

Conclusions: We found no significant association between ever use of talc in the perineal area (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.68-1.14) or upper body area (OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.71-1.14) and risk of endometrial cancer. The results were similar when stratified by subtype. Composite variables combining frequency and duration of talc use were also not significantly associated with risk (any perineal area use p = 0.07 and any upper body use p = 0.49).

* 4. Eur J Cancer Prev. 2011 Nov;20(6):501-7. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3283476242.

Conclusion:  " ... commonly accepted guidelines by which such inferences [association between talc and cancer] can be made. These scientific approaches include consideration of the strength of the association, the consistency of the finding across studies, and existence of a biological explanation of the observed phenomenon, among others. When applied to the context of a proposed talc/ovarian cancer association, we conclude that the weak statistical associations observed in a number of epidemiological studies do not support a causal association."

* 5. Cancer Causes Control. 2011 May;22(5):737-42. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9746-3. Epub 2011 Mar 10.

Conclusion: The International Agency for Research on Cancer has designated perineal exposure to talc (via the application of genital powders) as a possible carcinogen in women. A modest association of ovarian cancer with this exposure was seen in our study and in some previous ones, but that association generally has not been consistent within or among studies. Therefore, no stronger adjective than "possible" appears warranted at this time.

* 6. J Epidemiol Community Health. 2008 Apr;62(4):358-60. doi: 10.1136/jech.2006.047894.

Conclusions: The current body of experimental and epidemiological evidence is insufficient to establish a causal association between perineal use of talc and ovarian cancer risk. Experimental research is needed to better characterise deposition, retention and clearance of talc to evaluate the ovarian carcinogenicity of talc.

* 7. Eur J Cancer Prev. 2008 Apr;17(2):139-46. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32811080ef.

Conclusions: "... In this review article, we discuss the chemical and morphological features of talc and asbestos, and explain why despite their similar chemical classification talc does not possess asbestos-like carcinogenic properties ... In addition, the therapeutic use of high dose cosmetic grade talc for pleurodesis has not been shown to cause cancer in patients receiving these treatment modalities. Talc is not genotoxic. Mechanistic, pathology and animal model studies have not found evidence for a carcinogenic effect. In summary, these data collectively do not indicate that cosmetic talc causes ovarian cancer."

So, every review article I could find about this issue (i.e. perineal applications and I didn't even include them all here) finds that there is not enough evidence to conclude that talc (without asbestos) is carcinogenic.  Some studies like #7 go even further and conclude there isn't even a likely mechanism.  Please note study 2 is over 60K subjects and is more recent than the old monograph you linked to from 2010. 

Therefore the evidence is marginal as concluded by the experts who wrote these studies and reviews.

Key word there, "possibly"
Was asbestos found in her system? Ovarian cancer is not mesothelioma.
Except these ovarian cancer cases aren't asbestos related. The claim is that pure talc causes ovarian cancer. Which is scientifically dubious.
This has NOT been an issue since the '70s. With that said, one can not be sure of the real effects of just the talc. There is really too little reliable information on the topic. But these cazy awards need to stop.
* J&J ignored the warnings of their own expert consultants that talc may be carcinogenic. The expert testified at the trial.

* The company that produces the talc used by J&J labels it as potentially carcinogenic. J&J takes that talc, mixes it 99% talc and 1% fragrance, then packages it with no warnings as to the potential carcinogenicity. 

* [The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on limited evidence from human studies of a link to ovarian cancer, IARC classifies the perineal (genital) use of talc-based body powder as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.”](https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol93/mono93.pdf)

* Analysis of the plaintiff's tumor found embedded talc. The plaintiff showed no genetic predisposition for, or family history of, ovarian cancer. 
There are also no surviving samples of talc from any producer from the 50s and 60s that are sufficiently preserved to be reliably lab tested.
For your lungs, not your ovaries 
Except her cancer wasn't in her lungs....
So I'm a (big) guy who uses talcum powder. Am I gonna get ball cancer? No I'm not putting it in my dick hole. 
They ignored warnings by their own experts. The talc they use in the product came  labeled as potentially carcinogenic. They took said talc, combined it with a small amount of fragrance, and packaged without warnings for potential carcinogenicity. Analysis of the cancer tumor found embedded talc. The plaintiff had no family history of cancer and showed no elevated genetic predisposition. The IARC classifies the perineal (genital) use of talc-based body powder as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" based on limited evidence of a link to ovarian cancer in human studies. There isn't definitive proof, but there is fairly strong evidence in this particular case pointing to talc, and there is definitive evidence of J&J knowingly and intentionally neglecting to warn customers of the potential risks (which is the primary reason for the hefty judgement against them). 
That's why economic systems are terrible. 
There is evidence, which is why both their own consultant and the manufacturer called it potentially carcinogenic
There is evidence. So your premise is false.

One purpose is using on baby butts for diaper rash. Using on adult butts is not off use.
Actually it's not. Products liability cases are premised on any forseeable use, including incorrect uses.
Exactly. That's why they make douche's and feminine washes for those areas. That is their intended purposes. It's not the intended purpose of baby powder.
They probably douched afterwards so you should be fine.
have you never lost your car keys?
And when my dad taught me how to use talcum powder as a kid he told me not to use too much and dont breathe it in or get it near your eyes.

The fact that the woman was blasting this shit up her vagina (which, internally, is a very sensitive organ akin to the lungs and eyes) in copious amounts for 20 years is her fault. She wasn't educated in health and hygiene matters and was relying on advertising to educate her, which is silly. 

The most J&J can be blamed for here is not putting detailed enough directions on the containers. The award amount is ridiculous and we can bet with confidence that it will be massively reduced on appeal, assuming the case isn't overturned on a technicality entirely.
that much. 
what are you thinking of putting inside you? i've never seen a warning label for sticking graphite powder up someones 'parts' do you think it is necessary?
Ok "common sense" isn't that coating your undercarriage with baby powder will cause cancer. Why are y'all being such jerks? 
There is no way to have evidence when only one person is afflicted.  Proof takes a cluster of harmed people that mathmatically prove it.
That goes for most natural and artificial chemicals, heavy metals, lead, etc etc etc etc etc.  The amounts used to cause cancer in a few rats out of thousands of rats could never really be consumed by a conscious person.

Even with asbestos, the worst cases are of those who were smokers because the fibers stuck to the tar.

Having even a few lawyers on staff with a science background can go a long way to help mitigate/shape evidence and push/pull testimonies into certain directions. It doesn't have to be about the juries having that background,but having lawyers who know what's valid and what's bullshit.
The problen IS the jury. Trial judge would be better.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7083145
Yes, keep the bottles. It can't hurt to keep them. Hopefully you never develop ovarian cancer. 
LOL, political science isn't an actual science degree. This case didn't hinge on actual peer reviewed science. They convinced 12 retards too dumb to get out of jury duty that plausibility  = hard science.
People with multiple science degrees make asinine claims all of the time. And attorneys, well, not exactly the most trustworthy folks.  
And plenty of people used it every day for decades and didn't get ovarian cancer, the fact that some women got ovarian cancer and used talc isn't a problem. It's whether they disproportionately got ovarian cancer compared to those who did not.  Most in the scientific community would say the "jury is still out" on whether there is any association, so stating like there is some scientific fact that 5+ years of use is cancer causing is both disingenuous and not well supported by any evidence.  Its not that hard to search scientific literature, just go on pubmed.  Here is the latest meta analysis of the association: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079603

even if you chose to believe it the 22% increased RR would increase your incidence of ovarian cancer from 11.7 per 100,000 woman years (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html) to 14.3 per 100,000 woman years.  Really not something to blow your load  about.
You've never heard of pathology slides? You're an idiot. 
Here is a dollar for you having cancer. You are a douchebag
How about ban the product so people actually don't get exposed to harm. That'll be a wake up call. 
It'd probably cost more to distribute the money and what about the plaintiff? She only gets a dollar?
It's their fault because they knew it was used popularly that way, knew the dangers, and still kept the talc in the products needlessly. 
[deleted]
I didn't claim that the evidence was definitive, and I explicitly stated that the IARC found perineal use of talc to be "possibly carcinogenic" based on "limited evidence of a link to ovarian cancer in humans."

Despite the uncertainty of the link, I think it's a mischaracterization to say that the case was marginal. You have a patient with no genetic or familial disposition for ovarian cancer who develops cancer. Analysis of this person's tumor finds talc at the center of said tumor. Person who developed cancer regularly used talcum powder perineally, in a manner consistent with the product's intended use. IARC, in addition to other agencies, has recognized that there is evidence to support the potential carcinogenicity of talc when used perineally, something of which Johnson & Johnson was most certainly aware. Johnson & Johnson's own industry experts warned that talcum powder was potentially carcinogenic. The talc that Johnson & Johnson uses comes labeled as potentially carcinogenic. Johnson & Johnson chooses to ignore studies, warnings from their own experts, and warnings from the supplier of their primary ingredient in bringing talcum powder to the market without informing their customers of the potential risk.

There is no definitive consensus on the carcinogenic potential of talcum powder, but the idea that it was potentially carcinogenic was well-known in the industry. As a company, you can choose to do what Johnson & Johnson did and take the stance that talcum is not carcinogenic because study results have been inconclusive, but you expose yourself legally in doing so. After all, while talc isn't proven to be carcinogenic, it also hasn't been proven to *not* be carcinogenic. It would be one thing if J&J had no knowledge of the potential risks (provided appropriate due diligence) in bringing the product to market, but that's not what happened here. They new of potential risks, and they chose to subject their customers to that risk without their knowledge. You couple that with the lack of predisposition and the presence of talc at the center of the tumor, and you have a fairly strong case, despite the lack of a definitive consensus in studies of the carcinogenic potential of talc. This case is mostly about the known possibility for risks and Johnson and Johnson's willful decision not to inform their customers that there may be a potential risk. It is understandable why they didn't want to convey such information, but it does not absolve them from having taken the right to make an informed decision out of the hands of their customers. 
Had they provided such a warning, they wouldn't be finding themselves on the wrong end of a series of judgments. When you introduce and do not establish usage limits, then you are potentially liable for damages relating to usage that is consistent with that for which the product was intended. I don't know what you're trying to get at regarding God, the sea, and his fiscal limitations.
No there shouldn't. That's also not a valid comparison, though. 
IARC lists aloe vera whole leaf extract as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" because, while there is insufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals specifically for oral consumption of whole leaf extract. There is no ethical way to really assess the carcinogenicity in humans because you aren't going to feed them aloe leaf extract to see if they get cancer, are people don't generally consume the whole leaf extract form of aloe because it is bitter and tastes like shit. As such, it lands in 2B (potentially carcinogenic in humans) based on the evidence in animals but lack of evidence specific to humans. It is notable the the International Aloe Vera Science Council does not recommend the use of the form (whole leaf extract of *Aloe vera* Miller) that showed potential carcinogenicity in products directed at humans.

https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol108/mono108-01.pdf

IARC reports there is "limited evidence" of carcinogenicity in pickled vegetables as prepared traditionally in Asia. This is based on a series of studies that generally show a correlation between certain forms of cancer and consumption of the pickled vegetables in question, but which don't entirely corroborate each other. 

https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol56/mono56-7.pdf

Slate covered a more recent review of available studies on pickled vegetable carcinogenicity and found that there does seem to generally be a link:

>"Doctors have repeatedly attempted to substantiate the connection between pickled vegetables and cancer through clinical studies, with mixed results. But, taken as a whole, there does seem to be an association. A 2009 review of the existing studies conducted across Asia concluded that regularly eating pickled vegetables roughly doubles a person's risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma."

Furthermore, they state that there are theories regarding the potential pathway:

>"Researchers now think the culprit is the fungi responsible for the fermentation process. As part of their natural life cycle, the microorganisms release a variety of possible carcinogens."

While there are no definitive links to those in Group 2B, that's what Group B is; substances that may potentially be carcinogenic to humans. As far as I can tell, there is no scientific consensus one way or the other regarding the carcinogenicity of the substances you highlighted that I addressed above. They certainly don't appear to have been "debunked" as you claim, and the fact that there are numerous studies suggesting potential carcinogenicity suggests that their inclusion in a list of possibly carcinogenic substances is not as "ridiculous" as you suggest. 
You could be entiltled to compensation for that comment.
Asbestos causes multiple health problems, not just mesothelioma, dependent upon how you're exposed.
What seals it for me is that their supplier supposedly had a "this might cause cancer warning" on their packaging. If they didn't carry that warning over, they are just asking for liability and lawsuits. 
> But these cazy awards need to stop.

I disagree.  If the company was proven to be negligent or was intentionally hiding serious health concerns for the sake of making a profit then these punishments, even one this large is most likely too small.

Edit:  I am going to add to this after you downvoted me.

You are basically saying to abolish the whole point of fines, awards, jail/prison time, and any other variety of punishment.  These things are put in place and are well known for the express purpose of prevention.  If the awards do not cause a hardship to the company then it is not meeting its purpose.

This is much like how some countries do not utilize static speeding fines.  The amount of fine is based on your wealth.  A really rich person could have to pay a million dollar speeding ticket when the average bloke pays out 100 dollars.  By doing this it is a deterrent to everyone instead of just normal people.


>Analysis of the plaintiff's tumor found embedded talc. The plaintiff showed no genetic predisposition for, or family history of, ovarian cancer.

Where does it say that? That part seems pretty incriminating 
Any fine particle in any mucous membrane where it can induce long-term irritation and inflammatory response.  Think sand in a clam, except the pearl that forms is aggressive cancer.  Except if it's a pearl.  Hasn't been a pearl yet, but you never know.
[deleted]
There is mixed evidence relating it to ovarian and uterine cancers for similar reasons. It's not conclusive, but it had not been studied much. It's not true to say there is no evidence.

Pretty much any fine particles are a risk, most things just haven't been significantly studied 
> No I'm not putting it in my dick hole.

??? 

Why not?
But you can make the little guy reenact that scene from Scarface with all the coke... 
Doubtful. Your chances may be slightly elevated, but there isn't anything truly definitive (J&J mostly got nailed for obfuscation). Still, might not be a bad idea to switch to corn starch. 
The cancers "linked" to talcum have been ovarian and lung in miners. So if it causes cancer, which is an issue apparently up for deabte because studies say nah and courts say yea, it'll hit you in the ovaries (which I presume you don't have) or in the lungs if you're mining the stuff for decades with little or no safety gear.

In short - you're balls are fine. 
What's wrong with you?!? You ALWAYS put copious amounts in your dick hole. Then just before you piss your little soldier looks like he is exhaling a big puff of smoke.....it's glorious.
No.  Because talcum powder hasn't actually contained talc for many many years.  It's cornstarch.
Well no system will ever truly be perfect because greed for money or power will always be its downfall.
Fits in your mom's coochie.
Pointing out that someone saying "coochie" in regard to ending up with cancer is not an ad hominem. It's pointing out that the person has some serious expertise issues.
I would like to think that products used on babies are safer than those used on adults. Wishful thinking.
She was putting it in her vagina.
As I understand it, for years baby powder *was* marketed as a feminine product, safe for use "down there" to make it drier and better.  I haven't dug into the advertising from that era to verify the claim, but I don't really need to: baby powder was *absolutely* marketed to be put on babies' genitals, and 50% of babies are female.  It's an absolutely reasonable step to take from "It's safe to use on my baby daughter's genital area, so it must be safe to use on my genital area."
>Exactly. That's why they make douche's and feminine washes for those areas. That is their intended purposes. It's not the intended purpose of baby powder.

Douches and washes are fucking horrible for women and actually lead to more medical problems than not actually using them.
You're wrong. 
With heavy metals like lead, it's the buildup over time because the body isn't efficient at excreting them. It's not a consumption all at once.

This is bad ground to promote juries over bench trails (judge) because the scale of this verdict is indefensible, but it highlights the differences between a parliamentary/constitutional monarchy and a republic. As us Americans are attacking every institution of government - one place we cannot apportion blame is state interference in the outcome of a jury trial.

It's a beautiful sleight of hand by the founders, we get to think our fellow citizen an idiot rather than think an instrument of the state is impeding access to "justice".


Every law firm involved with this kind of stuff has paralegals or lawyers specifically tasked with what you said, they see if the science is robust enough to make a successful argument. 

Furthermore lawyers don't rely on their own knowledge of the science, they rely on their knowledge of the law and precedent. They use experts to make an argument by leading them down a line of questioning during testimony. 
A tiny percentage of women who had ovarian cancer were studied and some of them also used talcum powder. That's... not evidence of anything. Particularly when it's just one researcher - the same researcher who was used at this trial.

Have you ever heard of Andrew Wakefield?
But if she used the powder she will develop cancer because this powder 100% causes cancer...
You probably didn't notice that there are both normal and punitive damages.  The normal damages awarded were enormous.  That doesn't make me a non-douchebag, but it does make me right.
Yeah...banning talcum powder without **far** more evidence than we have that it's harmful would be ridiculous.
The plaintiff is already getting the damages (in this case, it appears this is about $114 Million).  Why does she get the punitive payout as well?  That's specifically to punish the company, not to reward her.  That could go to charity or so many other things that aren't the plaintiff.
Maybe I'm not understanding which product is this but in baby powder talc is the product, no?

Also as name suggests it's baby powder, not female hygiene powder... unless like I said I missed something and it's a whole other product
The numbers you're citing aren't at all applicable to this case. We're not talking about someone eating the talc, we're talking about long-term, repeated exposure and the potential for it to cause cancer. Furthermore, ingesting a bunch of talc is in no way the intended use, but using talc in undergarments to keep dry down there is what the stuff is literally intended to be used for. A company doesn't need to inform customers of risks pertaining to unforeseeable misuse of the product, but they do need to inform customers of risks associated with prescribed usage.

Yeas, it really it quite simple, legally-speaking. Johnson & Johnson was aware that the talc was potentially carcinogenic. They knew this because it comes labeled as such from the supplier they buy it from and because their own experts warned them about it. Yet they went ahead and produced a product that is comprised almost entirely of talc and marketed it for use on babies without warnings stating it was potentially carcinogenic. It is quite simple because they did not provide clear an reasonable warning to their customers about the potential risks of which the company was fully aware.
Your citation and conclusion is from 2010, based upon older evidence than that.   The newer, better data with more subjects (over 60K in one study) shows that talc is most likely NOT carcinogenic.  So therefore,  J&J was correct to assume that talc itself is not carcinogenic.    To characterize all the newer studies that I cited as suggesting it is a possible carcinogen is misleading.  Read those conclusions there is nothing in them to suggest it is a carcinogen.  Science moves on. 2010 is a long time ago in this field.   Second, there is no way, no how, it is simply impossible to conclude anything from one patient's cancer.  

But there is a bigger point here.  When large penalties are assessed based upon old incorrect science it does everyone a disservice because it now sets up the "slippery slope" argument for the quality of evidence to be used in a court.  This is doubly true in jury trials where a glib, articulate lawyer can convince scientifically illiterate juries that there is more certainty than not.  
Not a valid comparison? We can draw a more direct, causitive link between excessive water consumption and death than we can between talc usage and the development of cancer. How is the comparison not valid? 
Aloe vera whole leaf extract...for oral consumption. Case in point riiiight there!

Pickled vegetables...poor evidence, especially of realistic absolute harms. It wasn't the best example though, so I'll grant you that.

The ones I'm referring to as repeatedly debunked (and the ones primarily being referred to as ridiculous) are: 

* Magnetic fields (extremely low frequency)

* Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, such as, but not limited to, those associated with wireless phones

Here's an explanation of the issues with the first one (and a closely related class 3 item): https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/extremely-low-frequency-radiation.html

Here's just one example of the severe backlash that the second of those got (as it well deserved): https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/are-cell-phones-a-possible-carcinogen-an-update-on-the-iarc-report/

Not without calling an 800#
If literally no one else has any shred of solid proof that talc can cause these kind of health problems, then I highly doubt this one company had it, and then suppressed it knowingly.

I highly doubt the person's case is based on proving that. Way too hard.
I can't find where I original learned it, but there was [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6v4z5f/johnson_johnson_ordered_to_pay_417m_in_civil/dlxqckt) from u/-nimblenavigator elsewhere in this thread that also discusses it.

Mesothelioma is caused by breathing particles into your lungs where they become lodged. your argument that she breathed in baby powder giving her cancer in her ovaries makes zero sense.
how do you define greed? some homeless person or barely surviving person probably considers you greedy
Yes it is.

Edit: Never mind. Your first sentence doesn't make sense.
She put it in her underwear crotch area to keep it dry - same as you do for a baby with diaper rash.
IN her vagina? Like... not just on, around and in her labia... but in her vagina hole?
We always put pepper on it in our household!
Did any of these babies wear diapers for 20 years? It's called moderation. Being out in the sun in small doses is good for you, but too much of it gives you skin cancer. Should I sue the sun for giving me skin cancer? 
I was adding information, not arguing with OP.
> Particularly when it's just one researcher - the same researcher who was used at this trial.

He was used at the trial because Johnson&Johnson (the defendant) had consulted him in the 80s and he had warned them of the potential dangers. Why is that so hard for you to understand?

 No, that's not how it works. 
It was marketed as powder for the genital area that was good for all ages for a long time. 
[deleted]
I didn't characterize your newer studies as anything. You inferred from my original comment that I was suggesting strong link, and I pointed out that I had overtly stated IARC found limited evidence of a possible link. That's the extent to which I spoke about studies.

I hear what you're saying in general. I agree that the associate is questionable on the large scale, but the facts of this particular person's case do suggest talc was the culprit. At the very least, it appears to have been present when the cancer began to form based on it being embedded at the center of the tumor. I'm sure that piece of information caused many on the jury to question the conclusions of some of the studies that cast doubt on talc carcinogenicity, many of which call to question the feasibility of talc transfer perineally to the ovaries. It's one thing to have studies, but when your defense is that talc doesn't cause cancer, and a good chunk of the supporting rationale is that the substance can't get to the ovaries, then the jury is shown evidence that talc definitively did make it to the ovaries, then you have a massive problem as the defendant. The jury is charged with considering this specific case, and it is difficult to argue that the evidence in this specific case was fairly compelling, perhaps uniquely so. Regardless of whether or not J&J's position was defensible in not providing warning labels, they are absolutely going to get their lunch handed to them every time a jury decides that talc may well have caused an individual cancer case given their decision not to disclose the potential possibility to the consumer. While it is more than fair to question the statistical link, I disagree with your stance that this specific case was marginal at best, be that right or wrong.
Because we aren't talking about excessive water consumption, we're talking about long-term perineal talc exposure causing cancer. The argument you are suggesting is essentially "we know that excessive water consumption can be deadly but don't warn against that, so why should a company have to warn customers about using a substance that may cause cancer when we aren't aren't as sure about that substance's carcinogenic effects as we are about water toxicity." That's a baseless comparison. First, acute toxicity due to overconsumption of water is in no way comparable to long term exposure to a substance that may cause cancer when used for it's intended purpose. One is reasonably foreseeable, and the other is not. They can both result in death, but that's the extent to which they are comparable. Plane crashed and AIDS can both result in death, yet I think we can both agree that it would be ridiculous to make a comparison between the two. Secondly, talc, like water, is deadly if ingested to excess, yet a warning is not required for that as it's not a foreseeable use by customers (unlike the drinking of water) because ingesting anything to excess falls under Darwin's purview and the company isn't expected to warn against dangers of using a product for something vastly different than its intended purpose. Talc, on the other hand, is product for which the expressed purpose is application to the underwear/diaper area. If a company knows of potential risks associated with the intended use of a product they produce, especially those that aren't reasonably foreseeable, then they are obligated to inform the customer of said risks. Failure to do so leaves them liable for damages. 
>Aloe vera whole leaf extract...for oral consumption. Case in point riiiight there!

What are you talking about? You are attempting to undermine the 2B list, and the oral consumption qualifier in no way precludes Aloe vera's inclusion on that list. I'm not sure what exactly is "case in point" about this.

Regarding magnetic fields and radiofrequency, the "debunking" you're referring to amount to the lack of *sufficient* evidence that they are carcinogenic. That is not the same as no evidence, and the 2B category exists precisely for substances for which there is some limited information to suggest some degree of carcinogenicity, but for which such evidence is inconclusive or insufficient. It's basically a 'keep an eye on' list which has a fairly low bar for inclusion. This being the case, I don't see how their inclusion isn't warranted. I suppose one could make a case for Group 3 classification, but I don't see 2B being as ridiculous as is being implied.
You didn't even give him silver... redditors are so greedy nowadays, smh.
Get out!
I'm sure they didn't award the plaintiff $411-million for shits and giggles. There had to be something compelling/damming for that kind of judgement to have been awarded. 
I can't tell if you are a troll or not. That said, J&J has lost previous court battles because it has been proven they knowingly withheld the knowledge and continued to promote the product. 

And I am saying that the lungs are just one of many mucous membranes wherein long term exposure to fine insoluble particles of foreign matter can wreak havoc.  Pretty much all our epithelium is susceptible.
Ever sprinkled baby powder on your junk to keep it cool and dry?
That's because the comment wasn't specific to a certain kind of cancer, small particles are bad in general I just mentioned one most are familiar with 
There actually is mixed data
It's not from breathing it in. Think about another possible pathway... (hint: or just read the link)
Same as the dude in the comments said he did to keep his balls dry
No, she didn't put it IN her vagina. Applied it in her underwear as one would in a baby's diaper.
One of the women used it for 40 years before getting cancer. I would consider the chance that it's the cause of the cancer to be very unlikely. Most people get cancer at an old age for whatever reason. It's very difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. 
That's hard to understand *because it's not valid scientific evidence*.

You can't pick a stupidly non-random sample group and search for a correlation within it. If you do that you're doing a preliminary study *at best* and you cannot rely on any findings as evidence for any theory. You can use a prelim study to create a theory *and then actually test it*, but all the prelim study data provides you is a different way to create a theory than sitting on your couch smoking weed. It feels somehow scientific, but it's not any more scientifically valid than a stoner randomly wondering if talc powder causes cancer. 

 
I've been warning that vegetables cause cancer for years
Because I understand science.

Again, ever hear of Andrew Wakefield?
Somebody won a settlement based on that claim. 
You are being very calm when replying to these folks. Kudos. Me, I am freaking out (hyperbole) that these people could be on a jury. I shouldn't be astonished that people can be so willfully obtuse or unwilling to trust established science...but I am.
TIL i guess - i've never really heard of it being marketed to grown ups 

edit: looks like it was - https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baby-powder-cancer-lawsuits/
That's ridiculous. You literally cited the levels for ingestion as the cornerstone of the argument in your previous comment. Those are completely inapplicable and have no relevance to the discussion. 

>You seem to stick to the mere fact that they get bulk volumes delivered which obviously will contain these kind of warnings. This can be said about every single product you wear/consume/use. Soap, coffee, anything over 10/20/50 years usage might result in rare situations that they might be carcinogenic. Should every single household product up to your underpants be labeled "carcinogenic"? Obviously not since we don't know the clear reasons.

You say I need to take a chemistry class -- which I have; I'm an engineer who works in the product compliance industry. Also, this is more a biological sciences question than a chemistry question given the likely carcinogenic pathways -- when the above statement makes it abundantly clear that you need to familiarize yourself with the laws applicable in this case. If you were aware of these, you would likely know that the fact that the talc was purchased in bulk by Johnson & Johnson has no bearing on its labeling as potentially carcinogenic. 

>Further more they couldn't inform the public because as said, they don't know. It's that simple. There is no statistical proof regarding this very situation.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, has categorized the perineal use of talc-based powder is "possibly carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence of a link to ovarian cancer in humans." This could not be more relevant to the scenario at hand. It's not completely definitive, but it is fundamentally erroneous to state there is "no statistical proof regarding this situation." 

https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol93/mono93.pdf

Also, Johnson & Johnson absolutely was aware of the potential risks. Their own expert consultants warned them of the potential risk and, as I've already stated, the talc came labeled by their supplier as potentially carcinogenic. If you are a company and are warned that your product may pose a carcinogenic risk when used for its intended purpose, yet you choose to still go to market with said product without warning customers, you're opening yourself up to a tremendous amount of liability. Whether you like it or not, that is the reality of the product liability landscape. When Johnson & Johnson chose not to inform their customers of the potential risk, they opened themselves up to this kind of situation. When you couple their willful neglect to warn customers with the fact that a person with no family history or genetic predisposition for ovarian developed ovarian cancer after regularly using talc for its intended purpose for an extended period of time and talc was subsequently found embedded in her tumor, you have a recipe for a massive judgement being levied against you. 

>I suggest you take some chemistry classes. Now mind you I only had 4 years in university as a minor though these basic issues are clearly explained. You really oversimplify a highly complex problem where there simply is no data on available.

While I don't appreciate you getting all worked-up over an issue that you don't seem to have a great grasp on, particularly when it comes to the legal landscape that pertains to subjects like this, I am going to try and take the high road here. If we are to continue this discussion, I ask that you take a different, more respectful, and non-demeaning tone. I am happy to discuss with someone who is seeking constructive conversation, but I have no interest in wasting my time debating someone who is only interested in trying to 'win' an argument. I'm not trying to accuse you of doing the latter, but the tone you took in your last comment does have me wondering. You are correct in that there is complexity involving this subject, but there are some very basic choices made on the part of Johnson & Johnson that exposed them to this kind of liability. While assessing carcinogenic potential of talc is complex, the product liability questions are very straight-forward. 
I bet if you were a teacher, you would give out this frown face 😞 to kids on poor answers.

Just like the death penalty, right? 
And they've won other ones because there is no science that proves a connection with talc & cancer
Regardless of whether talc caused her cancer, it didn't migrate from her lungs to her ovaries.
Bull. You specified "breathe". 
Rightz there is mixed data. And when you discount all the research finding no link to cancer funded by J&J, industry groups, abestos mining groups, etc., The remaining evidence is enough for a jury verdict. 
Huh. Who said

> Pretty much any fine particles you breath is bad
Balzak cancer- recently discovered with strong linkages to baby powder usage.
I wasn't sure if the plaintiff was that ridiculous or if somebody needed a brush up on their biology... 
there are two rules in reddit, don't try to argue science or economics if you know what you are talking about.
You obviously don't understand science. Are you aware that he wasn't the only expert used? This isn't hard to comprehend. His medical papers are also the most cited studies regarding talc and ovarian cancer, so again, you're wrong. 
Andrew Wakefield has nothing to do with this case, nor was he a consultant for vaccine manufacturers whose warnings were dismissed. You're attempting to establish a false equivalency. 
Without googling it, what the heck is a vaginal mesh implant? 
>But documents submitted to the court show J&J staff had raised concerns about the “spinning of data” in emails and male executives are seen bantering about a suggestion that sex with an earlier patient with mesh complications must be “like screwing a wire brush”. 

Keeping medical devices SO classy, guys.
I remember watching a documentary about this. A quote from one of the victims that has always stuck with me was “it was like your bladder moving over a cheese grater 24/7”. So awful. 
And the penalty, if any, will be a small fine to make sure they never do anything like that again.
Time and time again it's  proven, corporations are only interested in profit over people. Time and time again law makers state that corporations will do the right thing arguing  for less federal regulations. Time and time again the law makers are shown glaring examples that corporations don't have a conscience or any empathy for the pursuit of profits alone. Round and round we go.
J&J classing it up again. They really do not care about destroying the [lady bits](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/05/johnson-johnson-talc-verdict/101320524/)
I honestly don't know of a company that's selling these vaginal mesh implants that hasn't been sued yet. You have J&J, Cook, C.R. Bard, and Boston Scientific to name a couple of major ones that are being sued. Sooner or later, companies will decide not to make these since the cost of doing business is too high. 

Remember the [AIDS riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_UP#FDA) where people were protesting the FDA for letting people die on the streets without approved medication?

Women get them as a fix to incontinence caused by childbirth or menopause. It is for severe cases. You insert in mesh to shore up weak pelvic walls and muscles to prevent people peeing themselves when laughing, jumping, or just walking too fast. This is basically a company screwing over customers for profit. They did not properly test the product, knew it was performing worse than earlier products and did not pull it off the market.

What does "without Googling it" mean? You're asking people to respond only if they already know what a vaginal mesh implant is? Or you're telling everyone you're too lazy to spend 10 seconds finding the answer yourself and you want to be spoonfed? 
Technically the husband made the wire brush comment. Read further down in the article.
Correct, the rich people who levy the punishments against rich people strongly prefer to not punish rich people for hurting poor people.
Until our society begins to harshly punish rich people for hurting people and stealing money, we'll continue to decline. Rich people are to blame for all of the crushing problems in our society that, for some reason, never seem to get solved.
Corporations are legally obligated to put profit for their shareholders above all else.
I say test the product and limit the amount of side effects before trying to sell it. But hey, what do I know? I'm not a corporation.

I swear, those commercials for the "sue for damages caused by vaginal mesh" have been around for quite awhile. Maybe even as long as this product has been out...I don't remember for sure. 
I guess I have to speak up here so this guy doesn't speak for the industry. I work in pharma, so everything we do has to go through FDA approval. It is definitely a love/hate relationship, but overall they do a good job.

Clinical trials are a necessary part of any product that affects the health of patients, and it is vitally important that companies make sure they aren't going to do harm to patients.

Actually, working for a large company like J&J, this guy should welcome the higher cost of business, because it also stops smaller companies without access to capital from competing once you do the necessary safety testing and get proper approval.

Disclaimer: I'm just one guy, but I know that at my company, this thinking is much more common than that of the guy above.
I don't think that's a reasonable comparison.
There's also a pretty big difference between allowing people with a terminal condition usage of experimental drugs (or existing drugs for an experimental purpose) under the guidance of their medical team and a company just flat out not testing what is essentially a lifestyle improvement that will be implanted in a person's body. Yeah, being incontinent must suck a lot, but having to wear Depends won't kill you. Having AIDS will. 
Yeah, I work in the industry and everyone uses 510(k). Medical devices is a weird industry where the first company that gets regulatory approval usually shoulders all the cost of negotiating with the FDA and a clinical trial. The next company that wants to sell just has to show that it is similar to the first, so no clinical trial or upfront cost. The FDA even has a [flowchart](https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm080235.htm#page27) on when a device should be categorized as a 510(k). 

Both industry and consumer groups complain that 510(k) is a broken process, but trying to fix it is a way too complicated process since it is so integral to the industry. There's also a even easier level of testing called "Letter to File" where a company doesn't even submit the data to the FDA after making a change. Usually, this involves things like a product name change, but I've seen companies make devices longer/shorter and say that it is still safe & effective.
Would love to see how r/Libertarianism will argue that the "real"free market will prevent this sort of thing from happening


Did you stick a faulty vaginal mesh thingy majiggy up your vagina?
Man, the more I learn medically about the vagine the worse it sounds to have one. 
Looks like they were bantering about that wire brush comment via email, not originating it. According to the comment* you just replied to, anyway. Fucking awful.

Edit: changed "wire" (?) to "comment"
Agreed.

That's because money always will welled the power and control of the people, always. History spells it out painfully I'm afraid. 
I thought it was police officers in the other thread?

Go back to lsc.
No they are not. There is no legal obligation for corporations to do that. That's a myth that originates from the 80s afaik. There is nothing statutory in the law that says that. It's really just a made up excuse so executives can do venal and unethical and criminal shit.
This is true, but it's a bit looser than that. A company isn't going to face shareholder lawsuit (or not serious ones, at least) for doing the necessary tests to make sure a product is safe.
Yep, until their not...
What do you expect from someone that's sideways shilling to give J&J civil suit immunity for their willful wrongdoing?
Having to wear depends can give you pretty nasty infections.
Scrapping 510(k) would also kill competition. Whoever is first has the majority of the market and competitors are coming in from behind.
Especially when some of these companies apparently don't bother to test this shit and just ship it out for the cash. Ugh.
I'm about 6 mos. pregnant at the moment and just learned it's possible to get varicose veins in the vulva.  Yay.
Right?  

A lot of women lose bladder control after giving birth.  Kegals don't work for everyone unfortunately and a sling / mesh surgery is often necessary as wearing a diaper or pad too long puts you at risk of infection.  Being a woman sucks sometimes. 
Lol I got banned from LSC a couple years ago, for not agreeing with someone strong enough. The mods over there are lunatic fringe. Anyways, I associate cops with rich people, and lump their horrible behaviors in together, because police officers in America protect wealth, not people. So I appreciate you making that connection between the two threads.
If you don't take care of yourself.

AIDS, however, will give you nasty infections, no matter what you do. 
You already have this in Europe. Most medical devices get CE Mark first and then years later, they get released in the US. That's the reason why devices like the first insulin pump were already in use in EU for 3+ years before they got approved in the US.
I hope your meat_tunnel is okay.
I also just learned this by finding one, seven months :(
So when this happens do women have to use a fix like mesh for the rest of their life, or do things eventually "self correct"?
No, this should be a last resort surgery after the problem has failed to self correct.  Some women never regain bladder control after giving birth and what starts as a minor issue can become much worse with age. 
Shit. "Ouch", is about all I have to say on that subject.
I've taken this drug before, it did the same thing to me. It nuked my testosterone levels forever. It also made me permanently sexually disabled/permanent sexual dysfunction which has ruined my life. Fuck Risperdal.

Webmd:  For males, it may result in decreased sexual ability, inability to produce sperm, or **enlarged breasts.** If you develop any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.


US National Library of Medicine:  Risperidone may cause children to gain more weight than expected and **for boys and male teenagers to have an increase in the size of their breasts.**

This has never been hidden.  It's listed on every website that lists the side effects of Risperidal (Risperidone).

Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, **gynecomastia**, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds -- label of Risperidal 
It's not even the worst thing that risperidone does.  Like its atypical anti-psychotic cousin olanzapine (though not as bad), it stresses your pancreas' β cells, leading to significant weight gain and type 2 diabetes.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23812432

It's a class of drug that needs to be much more carefully prescribed than it currently is, and should by no means be prescribed off-label.
It seems like anti-schizophrenia drugs and anti-psychotics in general have pretty horrible side effects. 
And j&j will pay a minimal fine after making billions in profit.  Oh, and too bad about your tits tho.  Have you thought about a sex change?  We have several products...
Uh...I took Risperdal over a decade before and my psychiatrist made it very clear to me that this could happen. The data on gynecomastia was there. People need better psychiatrists; not all of them are idiots.
I know people don't want to hear about this, but pretty uch every useful drug has side effects. 

I mean, what are you supposed to do?

Any prescription drug should be discussed with your doctor, and the side effects should be discussed, and a judgement call has to be made. 

This is also a situation where too much information is detrimental. Right now, *any* side effect that occurs during trials must be disclosed, even if it only happens once and is extremely rare. All this does is have people tune out; when there's a hundred different side effects you *must* be told there might as well be none.

In this case, it looks like J&J didn't do anything particularly wrong; this side effect has been noted for over 15 years. 

I know reddit likes to sit around, rubbing their hands gleefully as yet another Big Rich Company gets could fucking over the little guy, but what exactly do you want? All drugs have side effects; all drugs affect different people differently, and all drugs--in one way or another--are literally crap shoots as to risk vs reward. And companies generally disclose as much as they can because they have to. I can't really think of any situation where any party involved can make things better.
We had to take my son off of Risperidone after the first year because it was causing an increase in breast tissue (luckily not enough as to be noticeable by anyone but a doctor). It sucks, not only because his breast cancer risk is now higher, but because it was the only med that actually worked. None of the anti-psychotics we have used since then have been nearly as effective, and now he is in and out of the hospital every few months, and mostly at the mercy of the voices he hears. 

Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

My doctors experimented with a number of different anti-depressants years ago, and Risperdal was one of them.  It did not work for me and I was not on it long, but I really didn't like it.  One thing about it that really creeped me out was that the whole I time I slept while on it, I dreamed about grocery shopping.  Just dreams of looking at different products to purchase.  I have never had dreams like that before or since.  If anyone else had any similar symptoms, I would love to know.
How long ago was this?  As long as I've learned about this drug, this has been a known side effect.
Remember that the GOP pushed hard to put a maximum cap on how much companies would have to payout in lawsuits. 
I'm sure this will get buried as I'm rather late to post, but I just don't see the story here--these are very well known and understood side effects of the antipsychotics. 

These drugs exert their effect by blocking dopamine in the brain. There are fundamentally four major pathways that are involved: 1. Nigrostriatal (responsible for helping to coordinate movement, this is the pathway that is disregulated in Parkinson's Disease) 2. Mesolimbic (this pathway is believed to have excess dopaminergic activity in Schizophrenia, responsible for the so called "positive" symptoms, such as hallucination, disorganization, and psychosis) 3. Mesocortical pathway (this pathway is believed to have lower levels of dopaminergic activity in Schizophrenia, responsible for the so called "negative" symptoms, such as flat affect) 4. Tuberoinfundibular pathway (the role of dopamine in this pathway is to inhibit prolactin release from the anterior pituitary, which is produced tonically in the absence of dopamine). From this we can see that the rational for using these medications is largely to block the actions of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway and reduce the "positive" symptoms of psychosis. However, an unwanted consequence is that dopamine is also blocked in other functional pathways. As a result, patients can experience problems with movement, such as dystonia and Parkinsonism (Nigrostriatal pathway), and can experience sexual dysfunction, such as gynecomastia and galactorrhea (Tuberoinfundibular pathway). These side effects are well known and well described and have been for a long time. Of the antipsychotic drugs, Risperdal is a notorious offender for causing gynecomastia. Source: MD
So, I'll remind reddit about those people who don't trust the drug companies who everyone's been hammering on.  You don't really trust the drug companies because they are doing shit to the drugs, but what about the anti-vaxers?

I keep saying that the whole issue is about trust, and people should step back and start investigating WHY people don't trust the system, because when you do you'll likely find out that there are some real reasons for not trusting companies and governments.
Imagine what else is being hidden from us by such companies?
this is a well known side effect of multiple antipsychotics illustrated through [basic neurophysiology](http://courses.washington.edu/conj/bess/hyperprolactinemia/prolactin3-web.png). dopamine inhibits prolactin release. dopamine antagonists promote prolactin release. prolactin promotes boobs. all antipsychotics are known to cause gynecomastia to some degree or another. the end.


Maybe he should use "No more tears".....i'm so sorry
Ugh. I had a psychiatrist (edit: brain fart, I previously said psychologist) prescribe this after I was recovered from an eating disorder. Luckily I noticed that severe weight gain was a side effect of the drug and my trust in that place was destroyed. (I went from a 16BMI to a healthy BMI of 23 by myself, only after that did she try to get me on risperdal.) 

To make things weirder, I was not psychotic or schizophrenic in the slightest. I only had depression and I was a recovered anorexic. I have no idea what she was trying to do. I'm not a conspiracy theory kind of person but I assumed she was trying to push medication on me and make my eating disorder potentially worse for more sessions/more money. While I'm sure it's useful for very serious mental health issues like severe schizophrenia that doesn't respond to anything else, I'm much better without it. Looks like I made the right decision. 
I took Risperdal when I was a teen but as a girl, I was going to grow breasts already so no issues there. Instead, I got lactation on top of weight gain. Nothing major but something of particularly disturbing concern considering I was definitely not pregnant so WHY was that happening? I was given that plus Luvox for my ADD and Autism and when I had learned that both those drugs were anti-depressants and anti-psychotics when I was neither depressed OR psychotic, I was mad as hell. 
The worse thing was that the weight gain didn't come from eating, because I literally felt sick from looking at food. I couldn't smell food or I'd feel dizzy and it was a task just to eat it. I want to say this went on for a year but here's the thing, I had zero inner monologue for the time I was on the drugs. 

All I can remember was being paranoid to the point of never being able to be left alone and that's it. Maybe it didn't fully fuck me over physically because I'd throw my pills behind my dresser whenever I got the chance. Eventually I was taken off of everything because I got a horribly painful infection in my left breast that apparently was an allergic reaction to medicinal steroids.
God, who knows what was flowing through my body or how it affected me in the long run? It was such a long time ago and reading all of your stories breaks my heart. Never once do I recall hearing from my terrible psychiatrist telling me or my parents about side-effects. I'm utterly convinced she only existed to pawn that garbage off to as many patients as possible. 
None of us should have gone through with this, especially as young children and teens. 
Excuse me if I'm wrong, or if I'm missing something, but doesn't our society depend upon the trust we have in each other as specialists in our fields?  No one with even an extremely high level of education would look at this and think, "oh you know what that was just an honest mistake, I'd still continue to buy drugs from J&J without worrying too much or researching the drug."  So why the fuck would anyone not expect a portion of the population to reject other forms of treatment?

Trust is definitely at the heart of the matter, and the drug industry needs to be held accountable.  If not that will only breed more ignorance and distrust, and probably more measles.
I took this for about a year, only about 1mg max. I did gain about 20-30 lbs over the year and after it I decided to engage in various exercising regimens. My overall fat levels went under 10% BF, but for some reason the "chest" (had no chest muscles really at the time) just felt fluffy. I thought my "lower outer" chest just needed developments. That was a mistake, as I worked out everyday it did look better, but only lasting a short while after exercising. This was my only escape. I was exposed to the news a few months ago and then I realized what was happening. Now, it will take some planning and tests to handle it. I hope everything will turn out ok. 
I knew the drug did this from watching an episode of House..
The FDA may have approved it, but that doesn't mean it's been thoroughly tested or proven safe for consumption. On average, over 250 Americans die every day as a result of adverse drug reactions to FDA approved products.

I suggest watching American Addict on netflix.  It goes into how this practice is very common among the big pharm comps.

How large of breasts are we talking about here?
Took that every day for 4 years 12-16. Sketchy stuff
Johnson & Johnson: A family company. 
I used to be on Risperdal but I'm a female and started lactating because of it. I also had muscle spasms in my face where my eyes would randomly just get stuck looking up and I had to wait for them to relax to be able to see properly again. My psychologist never warned me about it and when I told her about it she just said "Oh yeah, that is one of the side effects". That was pretty much when 17 or 18 year old me decided to stop taking my psychologist's advice as law and look into side effects on my own before deciding to go on medications. Sometimes it felt like she was just a glorified pill pusher and not really trying to help me in the slightest. 
>evidence that the drug could such issues

They accidentally a word.
I can't seem to live functionally without risperdal, and I'm terrified of this happening to me..
I was on this shit. You do not feel good. Is there a class action. I've got some medical documentation to back up lower testosterone. 
When I was in elementary school I was diagnosed with tourretts syndrome and was treated with this medication. The tourettes has been gone for years now.

I was diagnosed with gyno 5 years ago and quickly had surgery to correct it. 
I took risperdal when I was a kid. Cylert too. 

Did you know you can die of liver failure from cylert?

Of course these companies know these things are gonna happen to a small percentage of people, and yes, they should disclose everything that could possibly go wrong. I don't reckon there is a pill out there that doesn't have one bad side effect. 

Poor kid though. 
ITT: Gross misunderstandings of the androgen class of hormones.

This is the government's fault. If they would just deregulate the pharmaceutical industry people could boycott these medications after it horribly disfigures their family members. 
I'm gonna start slipping risperdolls is my girlfriends corn flakes in the morning, so she can grow some big ass titties
its like a little booby trap in a bottle...
Maybe if we give these companies tax cuts they will stop trying to kill us. 
AMA request: Jamie Johnson. What are his thoughts on his family's product. 
I used to work at a mental health hospital and some of the adolescent males that took risperdal would lactate this clear liquid.  So sad that the psychiatrist would prescribe that drug.   
I am from a generation that used to trust in brand names like a religion. J&J meant to me happy babies and nice baths at home with caring parents... blah blah blah. So sad.
:(
I was on this medication and although I didn't grow breasts I got uncontrollable muscle twitching and was immediately taken Off of it. But I still worry about the long term effects because sometimes my muscles just jump involuntarily. Quite terrified actually. 
anyone else hoping they'd show his titties?
If your son needs risperdal I would think boobs would be the least of your concerns
All antipsychotics inhibit dopamine which causes an increase in prolactin! = breasts.  Growing breast isn't a side-effect, it's an EFFECT of dopamine inhibiting drugs.  I hate big pharm, but any and all antipsychotics do this to some degree.  It was the doctors responsibility to warn the patient of this phenomena.  Usually if you're at the point where you need t an antipsychotic, growing breasts is the least of your concern.  FWIW, risperdol is one of the only antipsychotics approved for use in kids, which is why this has even gotten legs.  Can't let our children grow breasts.
You seem to have a word
Anyone that has a mental illness or mood disorder either needs a doctor, family member or to take it upon themselves to be educated about medication side effects.

Currently there is no panacea anti-psychotic. Add that to the fact that a lot of medication regimens for mood disorders are changed because of the cyclical nature of the disease. Also, there are many drugs that are used interchangeably with different illnesses.

I took Risperdal for all of three days before I suffered from a motor deficiency where my arms and legs would lock up. Since then I've made it a point to educate myself about what potential side effects any medication I might be put on does.

tl;dr: If you take medication SOMEONE needs to be aware of the potential side effects.

I was forced by the government to take injections of this drug for 6 months.  Worst eight months of my life!  
Same here. I have nice small titties to go with my already not very manly body. Also, cannot grow facial hair. Don't know if that is linked or not. Have already talked to lawyers last year.
I can hear the stampede of thousands of citizens rushing to hold their government and big pharma accountable.

oh wait, that's just the sound of people leaving the superbowl.  my bad.

Do other bipolar medications like Abilify and Latuda also cause this?
"The drug could *cause?* such issues"?
So....where can I get this?
I was on this drug for a good long time, my weight increased from ~70kg to 95kg in a matter of months, starting to work off that weight now down to 88kg and its slow going, but it did what I needed it to do which was to suppress some tics that were getting out of hand, not going back on it, messed my weight up far to much.
If people think that this is somehow unique or some tragedy by the pharmaceutical industry, it's not. This is the new normal and this has gone on for decades and will continue to go on for decades. They own the government, they own the FDA, the *own* the approval process. 

This is the tip of the iceberg in what they approve that should've never been approved and millions have died and suffered for the quest for profits, unfortunately. 

And if you think enlarged breasts are a tragedy, you haven't even *begun* to study some of the horrible side effects caused by all of the common pills sold in the past 20 years. Trust me: they go *well* beyond enlarged breasts.
But Marijuana is still illegal folks.
Jeez, i took these pills when i was 11, was on them for about a year before i had to drop them to gain weight.

I was very tired and anxious when i was on them but never noticed anything other than that.

I hope this doesn't get buried.

There is a drug that has been invented that eliminates many of the terrible side effects you've been reading throughout these comments. It is currently called ML321. It has not reached FDA testing yet, but it appears to drastically reduce the number of side effects while still treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette's Syndrome, Huntington's chorea, depression, and hyperprolactinemia. I can't divulge much more information without violating my NDA, but I can tell you for certain that major strides are being made in this area.

For those who want a layman's understanding, these drugs are generally try to interact with the D2 receptor. However, many of these side effects come from drugs interacting with the D3 receptor. The drugs we have now hit both -- like a key fitting into two keyholes. It was previously thought impossible to make a "key" that only fit in D2 and not D3, but a scientist at the NIH made such a drug. Thus, the drug only hits the D2 receptor and not the side-effect causing D3 receptor. In actuality it is much more nuanced, but that is the general gist. If you would like to read more, the link below has a much more scientific explanation.

The reason I know about this drug is because I'm on a team that is trying to get the licensing rights from the NIH in order to bring this drug to market. Hopefully we can make some progress in the near future, but I wanted people to know that hope exists.

http://www.neurostartupchallenge.org/invention-4.html

**TL;DR: A new drug is likely to drastically reduce these side effects, but it has not gone through FDA testing yet. See the link for more science.**
Can anyone explain the benefits of them burying the issue?  It seems like a side effect that isn't too damaging for the user, but one that they should be aware of.
some fucked up side effects...

If the choice is between psychosis and a little extra breast tissue it's a no brainer. The Parkinsons symptoms and weight gain also suck.

This thread makes dickchop almost understandable
I like to imagine that the people in their R&D department who figured out that the drug makes men grow breasts thought this would be a really funny long term prank. Any other perspective just makes me angry.
As an Aspie, so many people I know in our community have taken and are still taking this drug. Most of them are guys. This is like the boys' version of the Yasmin acne med scandal for girls. 

I find it disturbing that so many Americans are on prescription drugs at a young age when what they have is a learning disability that needs a special educational program. 
[I wrote a joke about this!](http://imgur.com/WSM4kxE)
Hell, the tubby coat-wearing motherfucker's got tits.
If only this were the only hidden side effect of antipsychotics.

Her son is fucking lucky.

If you trust your doctor and pharma with your health, without doing your own research, you're an idiot.

If you do it with someone else's health...you're and idiot and an asshole.

If you live in America, the medical industry is not there to help you, they are there to make money off you.  

There are great resources available through the medical industry, but if you don't take ultimate responsibility for your own health, you will get fucked over.
I am quite irritated. Due to my work I get in contact with many psychiatric patients, many have Risperdal/Risperidon as their medication. Every one of them knows the side-effect. Some decided to not take it, but most of them have a better life because of it and are willing to live with the side-effects.  
Risperdal/Risperidon is THE drug to treat schizophrenia.
  

Even IF the side effects don't get mentioned by the doctor, every patient that takes prescription drugs/medizine is responsible to read what the drugs do and which side-effects may occur. Who takes drugs without knowing what they do or not do?  



I was on this shit for a while, and I recall my nipples hurting like a motherfucker, but I was changed over to Adderall shortly after. Thankfully, my libido is largely untouched.
You need to talk to a doctor and lawyer. Literally stop whatever you're doing and get a lawyer right now and ask him if he knows a doctor *after* you get the money from suing.
One week into rehab (drug) I was put on Risperdal. I distinctly remember asking the psych if there were any side effects and he assured me that they were minor (he looked away when he said that so I suspected he was bullshitting. He also wouldn't tell me the reason he put me on it). I googled the side effects the minute I got out and was shocked and immediately threw my script away.
I don't mean to be pedantic, but the condition you linked is post-SSRI sexual dysfunction. Risperdal is not an SSRI, it is a tranquilizer. So the article you linked doesn't directly apply to risperdal.  But the article does mention it once:

>Major tranquilizers — quetiapine, risperidone, haloperidol, ziprazidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine and so forth — are also known to cause permanent sexual death.

That sounds much worse, tbh.
Risperidone is not an SSRI. It is an antipsychotic agent with a primary action of reducing dopamine levels in the brain. 
My life was ruined by a prescription drug as well.  An SSRI antidepressant that I tried for my anxiety gave me permanent sexual dysfunction.  I only tried it very briefly.  The condition is called PSSD (Post SSRI sexual dysfunction).  I've heard anti-psychotics can cause the same type of permanent sexual dysfunction as antidepressants.

I had no idea SSRIs could cause permanent sexual side effects like genital anesthesia and complete libido loss.  My penis and testicles feel like rubber.  Its absolute hell.  I absolutely would have never tried an SSRI if I'd known it was a risk that I'd be made asexual.  Fuck SSRIs.
Sorry to hear about your situation OP, and I hope things do get better for you.  The portion below is for the people replying to your post.

Some people have asked a lot of questions, why aren't you a millionaire?  Why haven't you got a lawyer yet?

Some answers to these questions.
"In 1978, the Canadian Supreme Court limited damages for pain and suffering. Adjusted for inflation, the cap now is just over $300,000." 

"Canadian law firms, unlike U.S. firms, often require plaintiffs to pay for an initial investigation to determine whether the claim has merit. That cost discourages many people from pursuing a lawsuit."

Canadian courts don't often award punitive damages like US courts, so costs will only cover attorney's, healthcare costs that he has to pay for upfront, and possibly as much as $300,000 for pain and suffering.

That 300k would not be just his, but would end up being split between him and attorney's involved, all who get their cut before he see's any of it.

The short answer: even if this was a slam dunk case, the risks are extremely high (if he lost his case, he is on the hook for paying attorney's fee's and court costs), the rewards for winning are basically just him getting money back he'd already have to put upfront to get the case to trial.  If he's lucky, he might see that courtroom before the year 2020, and still have a couple loonies to rub together.
In the UK it's not common for drugs like this to be advertised on TV. The only ones advertised are cough medicines, indigestion remedies and hay fever pills, antihistamines etc. that's as hard as it gets. 

There's been a few times watching something on Hola (VPN for USA) where you get an American Ad for a medicine for depression for example. The disclaimer for the side effects is often longer than the actual advert. The side effects are sometimes similar to,what the medicine is supposed to be treating. Anyway. I can't think of a specific example, but it sounds like there's some fucked up drugs your doctor can prescribe that have side effects worse than the original condition. 
And how aren't you profiting in the millions from this?

These people aren't wrong. I don't know the important details, such as where you're from, how long ago it occurred, etc., but you need to see a lawyer ASAP. There's a thing called a statute of limitations. Your case also sounds so slam-dunk. Get a consultation. Just do it. 
"Oh sweet, there's a drug that can give me boobs?"

*Keeps reading*

"Well, nevermind."
Can you take testosterone supplements and counteract the effect?
Would testosterone replacement therapy not help you out?  Maybe not for completely for the sexual dysfunction but I feel like it would help?  How old are you?
But risperdal is not an ssri and that link is for post-ssri sexual dysfunction.  
You're link to SSRI-induced permenant sexual dysfunction. Risperidone isn't an SSRI, nor is its activity anything like SSRIs. Risperidone probably causes sexual dysfunction through a completely different mechanism. 
I was forced to take that shit by my school system. Ever sense then I've been gaining weight, and haven't been able to lose anything, regardless of activity. 

I feel taken advantage of, and wish I could get some compensation for that shit. I wonder if they are going to pay out, or a place I can apply for a class action thing. 
Have you tried Wellbutrin?  It counters SSRI related sexual issues in most people.
 Here take this vaccine to fix it. Its perfectly safe. Pharmaceutical companies wouldn't lie to you now would they?
Cymbalta did this to me something awful. I just try my best to not to think about it.
Consult a lawyer. Now. This shit isn't acceptable, let alone for a huge company like J&J. 
Dude, stop replying to reddit and contact a lawyer right now.  They will lead you in the right direction.
Yeah, I don't want to leap to J&J's defense as I don't have any real knowledge, but I know shit all about anti-psychotics and I've heard before that this was a labeled precaution on the drug.
yeah.  I started my medical career in early 2000's.  I'm pretty sure we knew about it then.  (I KNOW we knew that it was a side-effect of a lot of anti-psychotics).  

It's also on the short list of precautions on my Epocrates phone app right now.   Meds have side-effects, sometimes real bad ones.  M.Ds just don't know who is going to get them until the med is given.  It's (a big) part of the 11+ years of their training to become physicians.   
The fact that it's on the label is really not the issue at hand in the trial though. The company under FDA rules was not allowed to promote their drugs use for children, it was only approved for adults. The company still did this anyway, by going to the pediatric neurologist's office and promoting the drug.
We knew this drug increased prolactin levels as soon as we started ours on it. Not sure why she didn't know; it's been well-documented. 

Besides, any mother of a child with issues that only Risperdal can handle should be doing TONS of research, both on the drugs the child takes and the issues he has. 

That said, I sympathize with the parent; having a child that needs this hardcore drug to "normalize" is one of the hardest things I have ever dealt with. Nothing prepares you for it.
Exactly. In every case I've seen it prescribed in (eight years in social work with troubled teens), the doctor has checked in frequently to monitor potential side effects and warned about this. 
I see psychiatrists prescribe that stuff like water.  And then I get to try and clean up the metabolic nightmare with a fistful of other drugs.

Please don't prescribe my already obese, diabetic patients drugs that will make the problem worse :/

Edit:  I'm not prejudiced against the class. I'm saying, if there is a reasonable alternative, try to use that first.  Especially please, don't use this flippantly or off label, especially in patients with metabolic syndromes.
I took this drug when I was 12 and what it did to me was awful. I am still  trying to lose the weight from the initial gain. My diagnosis? "Possible borderline personality or autism." They didn't even HAVE a diagnosis. I got one 30 minute psych evaluation. I was 250 lbs and being forced onto diets while still playing flag football and being on swim team. All my videogames and computer games were taken from me so I'd go outside more, but at age 13 I was already hitting the gym so I could take home ribbons in the state comp for swim team. Still the weight piled on until I was nearly 300 lbs. I have been insulin resistant since I started taking that drug. 

I ONLY TOOK IT FOR 2 MONTHS. The endo told me after bloodwork that it had completely reprogrammed my thyroid and I would now fight morbid obesity for the rest of my life.
And the worst part is, atypical anti-psychotics are STILL better than typical anti-psychotics.
Never try to commit suicide in Michigan, many hospitals will literally just pump you full of it instead of actually trying to help you.

Thanks Governor Engler!!!


I like how the govt thinks pot is worse than this
This is why people don't trust vaccines. Huge pharmaceutical companies messing up lives and getting away with it. One doctor's mistake makes an entire profession look bad, so then people become scared of putting aluminum phosphate in their babies because "oh no, what else could happen to them?"
Psychosis is no picnic either. 
Yep. Two of my female friends who were on antipsychotics started lactating. Seriously.
I'm really glad I stopped taking Prozac and Zyprexa. They killed my sex drive, made me constipated, and just didn't make me feel like me. After trying 7 different medications over the past year, I stopped a week ago and feel better than I've ever been.
Believe it or not, a lot of the older psychoactive drugs were even worse.
[Who knew this Family Guy scene would ever be so relevant?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV64X50FvFQ)
Don't worry, once news of this gets out everyone will boycott Johnson & Johnson, and then the company will collapse overnight, and *that'll* show that Ayn Rand was right!
Prolactin can be tested easily and regularly with blood.
> but because it was the only med that actually worked

I think this is something people are overlooking here. People want to demonize the drug when it was more of weighting the risks vs rewards in the wrong manner and hiding something they shouldn't have. 
It seems to me that being a busty functioning member of society would be better then the alternative in this case...

Same here.  I am on a relatively low dose, 3mg.  Risperdal and lamictal has changed my life dramatically for the better.  Even if I grew tits I would stay on it. 
I am on it as well, a very small dose with positive affects (effects?). I exercise regularly and keep as well a balanced diet as I can, and haven't noticed having any increases in the pectoral area. 
Despite all of this conversation, I'm glad you found something that works for you. 
I feel you on the dream aspect, Respridal gave me nightmares every night though.
The more shit I see companies pull, the more I think that "tort reform" is really just giving companies immunity from what little justice they can still face. 
I wonder how much J&J pays politicians... and how those politicians vote when it comes to these issues...
Thank you. I've been saying the same thing for the last two weeks with all the vaccine posts. I'm a nurse practitioner and have seen hundreds of adverse effects from drugs. 
>I keep saying that the whole issue is about trust, and people should step back and start investigating WHY people don't trust the system, because when you do you'll likely find out that there are some real reasons for not trusting companies and governments.

Yeah, all the fancy "evidence" from the fancy "government officials" says that vaccines are safe. [But they have also did that thing when they injected people with syphilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis_experiments_in_Guatemala). Now if your educated and go to school and learn about this kind of stuff you know that vaccines usually aren't syphilis filled and the end result of the risk assessment is **to get the fucking vaccine.** 

People don't trust the gov or companies because they have proven with regularity they'll engage in actions that would probably be called implausible if it was a movie. 
Hundreds of thousands of people had the disease each year.

Vaccine is produced.

Rate goes down to a couple hundred. 

Yeah, don't trust them.

Look at airbags and the scandal a few years back.  Do you think airbags would have been accepted if information about them causing child deaths early on would have been well known? How many lives would have been lost if people waited for smarter airbags or had the option to disable them? 

The average person is emotional and doesn't weigh information like a scientist would. 
Because vaccinations have been statistically proven to help overall as best as we can tell. Check out the CDC.
As far as *long* term side effects we can speculate there isn't any serious cause for concern but we lack the ability to 100% guarantee it. There is no doubt -- question everything -- but don't put peoples lives at risk because you couldn't make a decision based on solid evidence. There is no evidence to support vaccines cause issues with any regularity. There is lots of evidence to support vaccines save lives.
So yes -- go question vaccines but do this BEFORE you have a kid and need to make a decision.
Eli Lilly, the company behind the first SSRI antidepressant Prozac, hid its clinical trials from the FDA that showed patients who took Prozac were **12 times** more likely to commit suicide compared to older antidepressants.

http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/01/03/prozac.documents/

Former 35-year top executive director at Eli Lilly, John Rengen Virapen, admitted to bribing the Swedish government to approve Prozac even though the company knew the drug caused suicides and depression.  Here's a link to one of his speeches admitting to the evil things he and the company has done:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8bt8eUB1CU

John Virapen was also featured on The Daily Show segment 'The Pharmaceutical Drug Epidemic'.  He discusses how pharmaceutical companies have the power to pay off everyone including the FDA, researchers, media outlets, and governments so that their drugs' risks are kept away from the public eye.

Forget about that. What do even these companies not know about their products? That's the bigger danger.
So, so much.
Fuck, I feel line an anti-vaxxer reading this thread.
Anorexia as a diagnosis is by all means not something to be dealt with lightly. It's a huge fucking deal with a stupid high mortality rate, generally is extremely difficult to treat, and has a high relapse rate.

It's no joke, it's a very serious diagnosis. If a doctor prescribed you with a medication with lots of side effects, I assure you that they weighed the pros and cons of the medication versus untreated anorexia. Anorexia is an incredibly severe mental disorder with an incredibly bleak prognosis, there is no such thing as "just anorexia".

There is also no known proper treatment for it, a doctor has to just try to figure out what the patient needs based on individual quirks. It's a fucking hard diagnosis.  

Sorry, your doctor was just trying to help. They're not all idiots, they just weigh the pros and cons. 
That's not true they prescribe antipsychotics for depression sometimes. There is overlap in treatment . Sorry for the bad side effects you faced. But medicine is not perfect especially with psychiatric issues where everyone is very different. Anger comes from misunderstanding thought process of the person giving a medication which is very logical and sometimes warranted if you have a jerk in charge of your management 

It was likely being used off label for the weight gain to make you see results more quickly and help you see that you were okay at a healthy weight
I don't know your case and I don't presume to know any specifics of your symptoms when you were seeing your psychiatrist. I'm going to make one assumption to make this exercise worthwhile in that I'm going to assume you were continuing to have depressive symptoms after getting monotherapy with antideppresants like SSRI's SNRI's etc. Obviously this may not have been the case but I figured I'd clarify the assumption beforehand.  I also admit that there is a possibility your psychiatrist just wasn't very good as is true with any field of work.  

I figured I could let you know possible reasons for the medication (risperdal) being utilized in the case you outlined above. I thought you should know antipsychotics like Risperdal, Abilify, Zyprexa, Seroquel Etc. are used as augmentation agents to increase the effectieness of antidepressants for depression that is not responding to treatment or still having residual symptoms even after maximum dosage of an antidepressant is reached. Abilify is the one you often see advertised for this purpose specifically and is FDA approved. 

Other augmentation strategies used include Lithium, Thyroid Hormone analogues (though this option can lead to weight loss which would be problematic with eating disorders), Buspar and Wellbutrin (which is straight up contraindicated in persons with history of eating disorders). Its also possible that the psychiatrist had concerns that you had a Bipolar Spectrum illness like Bipolar Type 2 which would primarily present as depression as opposed to hypomania (for every 20 or so depressive episodes you have on average 1-2 hypomania episodes and often if you read the criteria a patient may view this as having a "really good week" and thus not bring it up which can make it hard to diagnose as we only know what we get told. Im working on the whole mind reading thing still). However depressive symptoms from bipolar disorder respond better to mood stabilizers compared to antidepressants. Antipsychotics are FDA approved as mood stabilizers and don't require the as frequent lab work like Lithium though monitoring for metabolic syndrome and weight gain would be warranted. In a case of someone with history of eating disorder I would say weight gain is a catch 22. Make you less likely to get underweight but puts you at higher risk to think negatively about yourself and change your dietary habits to counter the weight gain in a potentially unhealthy manner. It's possible the psychiatrist thought to themselves that if they started the antipsychotic that they could be covered for all the angles in regards to straight depression versus Bipolar Spectrum and get your symptoms better in the most timely manner. Though the key to all this as that it should have been discussed at the time of the appointment so a frank discussion could occur and the plan be developed with your input as well so alternatives could be explored if you chose to not pursue the risperdal route. This include side effects.  

Admittedly diagnosing at times can be difficult and understandably frustrating to both the physicians and the patients. I'm a firm believer in the adage that "a patient deserves the correct diagnosis" but sometimes this can be difficult/impossible because important treatment information just hasn't surfaced yet. As the example i gave above imagine a hypothetical individual that presents for depressive episodes multiple times in a row but then after 3 years of so/so to no response to antidepressants they come in fluoridly manic meaning the whole treatment plan has to be adjusted to take this into new information into account as the diagnosis shifted from Major Depressive Disroder to Bipolar Disorder which has a different treatment guideliens. That's three years that could have potentially gone differently if there was a lab test that could've identified Bipolar Disorder right from the start though sadly it doesn't exist yet. 

I readily admit this is all conjecture but figured insight may prove informational even if its not needed at this moment as it sounds like you are doing well which is most important. The goal for anyone should be maximum benefit/ability function with least amount of medications needed to achieve that goal.   

TL:DR Tons and tons of conjecture that hopefully provides some insight into what may be going through a providers head on deciding medication options.  Also the importance of open communication in the therapeutic relationship. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention importance of utilizing psychotherapy (talk therapy) to improve efficacy of medications (get the same benefit with lower dosage and less potential side effects) snd focused on medication side. Both have proven evidence of working though neither works as well alone as the two combined. Doesn't mean either HAS to be long term though that is very case by case dependent.  
All of these side effects are in the sheet of paper the pharmacy is legally required to give you when you fill your script the first time, but everyone throws it out.
Many doctors were just pushing pharmaceuticals.  Sorry you had to go through that.
You make it seems like this info hasn't been publicly available for years. Seems like ppl don't take it upon themselves to read about the drug their gonna swallow. The pharmacy gives out the a sheet of paper that tells the person picking up their medication about this, the patient just doesnt choose to read it. Even the most benign seeming drug carries significant adverse effects, that doesn't mean that the specialists didnt weight the risk v benefit.
Yet it was approved by the FDA or other regulatory body.  Nobody knows how serotonin receptors or norephinephrine work exactly, but studies have shown a connection between them and improving various mental disorders.  There are many indicated for the same things considering that for all that is really known is drawn from these test groups.    
     
Everything has side effects.  It is assumed though by a physician that when you seek help for these issues that they are interfering with your well being in the whole.  Not every drug works for everyone, and even the one that works is not without risk.  The physicians discretion is that the immediate problems need to be treated in order to improve quality of life and an open dialogue is required to be able to continue treatment.

I right
As they say in science, anything given in enough amounts, can be toxic. Some side effects aren't so bad. Like Lumigan is a glaucoma drug that has elongating lashes as a side effect. Now they sell it for lash growth under the name Latisse. I think there are many women who will find breast growth to be very beneficial. ;p
ITT: People who don't read about the side effects of the drugs they're taking and blaming companies bc they can't be bothered to read.
Are you joking? 
I know you're being sarcastic but this is my argument for being pro-gun.

The left would prefer you to die or be raped and then let the government do their job. The right would prefer you to handle it yourself and let them do the paperwork aftermath.

It's rare I side with the right but meh.
Damn bro, good idea ima try this too
I can't tell if you're being serious or not.
Funny that you mention that since marijuana can cause [gynecomastia](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gynecomastia/basics/causes/con-20028710)
What did your lawyers say? Have you checked your hormone levels? Low testosterone usually means decreased facial hair growth.
Look them up online.  It should also be the prescribing physician who explains some of this to you.  I urge you to have an open dialogue about your treatment with this physician who can help way more than reddit can
All other antipsychotic medications (including abilify and latuda) can in theory cause an increase in prolactin but risperidone is MUCH more likely to do so than any modern antipsychotic medication.
OP should clarify title in comments. No idea why people are downvoting you.
This a drug that helps keep psychotic symptoms at bay. How is weed relevant?
Weed can also cause man boobs...
This sounds exactly like someone who is suffering from BiPolar mania and has poor/impaired insight and poor judgment about their condition. 

Not saying that's you, but the number of people that have told me identical things after being court committed by their family on a mental health court order would shock you.
I have been on the same combination for 9 years and it has completely changed my life.  Even if I grew tits I would keep taking it.  I've been stable enough to keep a job and friends.  I love it.  

Edit:  It took me several years of slowly increasing the doses until I had the right combo.  It's possible you were prescribed too much too fast.  
Have you been on /r/bipolar?
[deleted]
Drug might not get approval by the FDA and they wouldn't make money.
...have you read the information leaflet for literally any drug ever? They all have that "emergency medical help" and "common effects" stuff. It's to cover themselves. Yes, more powerful drugs are going to list more side effects, but let's not cause a mad stampede, eh?
Don't be. There's no way this would be a permanent effect.
I'll consider getting one but I'm not sure if the legal expenses will be worth the pay out if the case wins and I'm scared of a huge company like J&J hiring the best to avoid losing/paying out.
This is a very common side effect of psychiatric drugs.  If people can sue for this I imagine there would have been cases already.
You did the right thing, I wasn't told of any of the side effects and thought they were temporary when I read the PI sheet which had no mention of PSSD,
I should have done the same.
Please forgive my ignorance. What is this drip typically prescribed for?
Yea there's no name for it but the article mentions that Rispersal can cause PSSD-like symptoms and like you said permanent sexual death which sucks hard.

It's not an SSRI or a tranquilizer, it's [an atypical antipsychotic](http://www.drugs.com/risperdal.html). 
Oh shit, maybe that's why I'm an asexual. I don't get anything out of sex and I was on antidepressants for years before I ever lost my virginity. I've been on no less than 4 different kinds and I'm not even 30. 

My depression has been coming on strong again and I was toying with going back on them, but fuck that noise. I knew something was up with that shit.
Another PSSD victim! We are few and far between and there isn't much awareness of the issue, what I have is similar to PSSD except it's caused by an anti-psychotic so it's even rarer. How have you been coping with it? Have you gotten any help or improvement? Have you considered legal action?
May I ask which one? My husband has been taking cymbalta (an SNRI) for a little over a year for depression and has been considering trying another type because this one causes sexual dysfunction, though it appears to alleviate after a few days off cymbalta. If the SSRIs his doctor is considering aren't going to be any better or cause permanent damage it might be time to look at other alternatives, because this is really screwing with his sense of well-being. 
What do you mean when you say sexual dysfunction?  Can you describe in more detail?  Can you still get hard and ejaculate?  Just curious... I am on medication that affects normal male sexual health (hormones, im transsexual) and although my libido is reduced its still fairly active and I still have functionality and whatnot its just more difficult.  Despite having very low T levels and hardly any ejaculate.
It's shitty that the drug you took for mental anguish, is actually now the cause of it.  
>  genital anesthesia

Mother fucker this explains so god damn much.
I'm *overly* horny but damned once I get my dick wet does it just go "meh, I'm done" -- lucky for me I'm in to S&M so it's less fucking and more.. other things mixed in. But still.. my girls like to get me to cum and can't, so they feel shitty. I don't like them feeling shitty. It's more like I can feel them.. but there isn't much sensation. I can't really describe it. It's like hey let's turn you all the way to 11 and then not let you do anything about it.

I was on several SSRI's over my life span. As a kid, teenager, and adult. Three separate times. I'm on xanax now. I'm not certain it does a bit of difference.
I am curious if a niacin flush would have any effect. I have heard it being used for ED before
Have you tried Wellbutrin?  It counters SSRI related sexual issues in most people.
I was on one for a short stint of six weeks, Fluoxetine, and I ended up getting mild genital anaesthesia. I told my Doctor about it, and said I was concerned about it being a permanent thing. He asked me if I read about it online, and I said yes. He said it was my OCD telling me I should look for those symptoms because I was expecting them, so it was psychosomatic. I ran the course of the drugs and never went back to him again. It was frustrating and my girlfriend didn't understand why I was so frustrated. 
Thanks for the extra info, the taking legal action route looks more bleak now.
There aren't a whole lot of side effects worse than psychosis. 
I live in Canada and have no idea on how suing the company works.
My breasts only grew a little bit but that's more than there was before and I definitely put on some weight. I was put on it due to a misdiagnosis too and I hate the psychiatrist who did this to me too but I think she's immune to any liability. Can you still get sexually aroused/maintain an erection?
I took Risperdal for about a year I think. I got fat as fuck, it was the lowest point of my life. I lost touch with myself and friends... Hell, really.

Anyway, it's been a few years. I lost the weight and eat healthy, look the best in my life, am no longer as paranoid/anxious. Social life.

You can do it. Trust me. Do it.

As for gynocomastia, not sure. Mine are pretty much completely gone. Lost the weight and do some chest work, good enough. I am pretty sure I gained some female breast tissue though, which sucks.

What those guys above are talking about regarding dysfunctional libido sounds like me... i get horny but my interest in relationships and sex is very, very low. I want them but the effort required just seems like a complete fucking waste of time to me. I have no desire to do it. I am perfectly content with masturbation... I thought it was just because I was somehow smarter or something, but actually it does tend to make me feel a bit unfulfilled. I wonder if the "sexual dysfunction" stuff mentioned above is the reason I have become like this.
Yep, it'll most likely make me infertile too which sucks because I wanted kids.
No happy ending, just feel like the suicidal sexless robot race.
The sexual side effects aren't related to the low testosterone.
It wouldn't help with the sexual dysfunction but it would probably help with the fatigue/inability to build muscle mass. I'm 22 soon to be 23.
That link also states that risperidone can cause something that is like PSSD, there isn't a name for it so I linked the most relevant article.
The article also states that risperidone can cause something that is like PSSD under Other Drugs but you're right, it's a different mechanism.
Yep, I'm on it right now, doesn't fix it because it's a different mechanism that fucked up my sexual functioning.
Have you recovered at all since then?
It was prescribed for me in 1994 and I was warned that it could cause lactation in both women and men. 
Drug salesmen are limited to the monograph and existing studies as far as claims they can make about their product. However, there is a "super salesman" called a medical science liaison (MSL). MSLs are given much more range as far as what they can say.  They have advanced degrees like MD, DO, and/or PharmD and have specialized with the line of products they rep.  They know all the studies, case reports, and post market surveillance available.   

So what probably happened was salesman goes to pediatrics and says "Hey, we've got a new antipsychotic that has shown xyz benefits in adult clinical trials.  Unfortunately we haven't been able to study this in children directly, but if you think this could help patients at your practice I can put you in touch with our MSL."  Doctor says "Sure I am always looking for new ways to improve the care I provide."

Then the doctor and the MSL discuss the applicability of the adult trials to children using their extensive and specialized knowledge in neuropsychology.  If the doctor decides to use the drug as an off label indication then that is completely with in their rights to do.   

Basically whenever a doctor has a question that can't be answered with "This peer reviewed clinical trial has shown..." or "If you look this page in the monograph...", they have to send that question up to the MSL.   This type of thing would fall under that category.  
My nephew was prescribed Abilify and became insatiable. He would sit down and eat a whole box of cereal with a gallon of milk for breakfast and eat two Hot Pockets with a 2 liter of soda less than an hour later, then eat a whole pizza for lunch. My sister was spending $400-500 a month on food for him and it still wasn't enough - he would throw things around and scream until she could get him something. His weight has been fluctuating ever since he got off of it  
Why is it they're more than happy to script out that stuff or SSRI's like water with 11 refills but if you ask for diazapam #15/5mg PRN for panic attacks they look at you like a drug addict? 
If your obese patient is suicidal or schizophrenic and the medicine prevents them from suiciding or injuring another patient, is it worth it then?
It's even worse as there's some evidence to suggest that obesity increase the likelihood of a person developing depression. 
I'd rather have a short, fat, diabetic life than be fucking crazy. 

Those were my options and I chose fat. 
Would liposuction or something of that sort work for you? 
I'm sorry. 12 years old, that's really unfair. I share a bit of how you feel. I was seeing a weekly therapist through student health services as an undergrad and really trusted and respected the psychologist I saw. Prescriptions were handled through an off-campus psychiatrist whom I spoke with for *maybe* 15 minutes every four or five weeks. We never hit it off in any sort of way. When I tried explaining that I was having moral conflicts and just sort of, picturing conversations in my head (characterizing different parts of a personality, really, not that deranged), he leaded me into say that, yes, I was hearing voices and I should take Risperdal. I remember asking him for how long and he said, "for now, consider it forever."

Seven months later I was up 40 pounds. I had never even noticed it was happening because I had no idea ANYTHING was happening. It's one of those drugs that promises you'll stop feeling the bad stuff because you'll be numb to feeling pretty much anything real. I have no idea how I graduated college. I've also suffered from some of the sexual dysfunction mentioned in other posts, as well as premature hair loss and a few other bonuses. This was eight years ago and I'd say it took maybe two years to recover physically and another 4 to level out emotionally after that. By then, the things I'd originally sought out therapy for were so far behind me and yet I was still being kicked in the ass by what had been called the "solution."  This wasn't a drug borne from sympathy, it was a drug made for the sake of having another drug.

I always thought that the thyroid/obesity connection was a myth.
FYI the lactation you describe and the gynecomastia in men are both caused by the same underlying problem. Namely that risperidone can increase the levels of prolactin in the body.
Congrats. After an entire thread of heartbreak your comment is a glimmer of hope.
Best change I ever made for both my mental and physical health was to start excersizing, a little over a year ago. Pick a number of times a week, a distance to go on elliptical, and a weight and number of reps on dumbbell bench press that you can handle, stick with it, and then over time, as you can handle it, increase the distance and/or resistance on elliptical and weight/reps on bench press. Also add other dumbbell lifts like bent-over row, curls, and alternating shoulder presses.

Also, alternatively, stick the cardio and do goblet squats. 
J&J knew.
Fuck yeah! *flushes Invega Sustenna pills*
Once enough guys grow tits and become asexual the market will self correct! No oversight needed!
As someone who used to used to work on a inpatient psych unit, i have seen Risperdal greatly improve the quality of life for patients and their families. There are some terrible side effects, however, the person prescribing it has decided that the damage it does to their patients body is outweighed by its benefits. It really sucks, but sometimes it's the difference between your child being able to live with you at home or having him live elsewhere (group home, RTC, etc)

When we participate in modern medicine, we assume the risk that we could fall into the small percent where things go horribly wrong. But for some reason, when we do end up there, we think we are entitled to millions of dollars.

Chlorpromazine is the predecessor to risperdal and has far worse side effects. Yet despite this, it was a miraculous medication at the time and still recognized as one of the greatest medical discoveries. Sometimes we have to deal with bad side effects if we want amazing results.
His age was a large part of it. His doctor was uncomfortable with his trying to go through middle and high school while growing breasts.


Breast reduction surgery costs around 4-8k and is usually not covered by insurance because it is considered a cosmetic surgery.  So ya...he could but it would suck ass
For some that would be a benefit.
That's precisely what it is. The documentary "Hot Coffee" is about tort reform.

It's like asking a bunch of murderers if there should be a cap on punishment.
That is all it is.

In kindergarten they tell you to be responsible for your actions.  Corporations don't like that lesson.
People act like vaccines have no side effects. Like companies have nothing but selflessness at their heart. 

I just ignore vaccine posts because the comments are always predictable. "Fuck homeopathy" "maybe we should dilute it more" "this is child abuse" "there is no reason to not vaccinate" "herd immunity" "fuck these people" etc. 

Anything that isn't the circlejerk gets downvoted. 

I'm by no means saying there had. But reddits attitude regarding them is toxic and predictable. 
Good lord, inject people with syphilis *one time* and you never hear the end of it.
I've noted that in battle for every soldier killed about 2 others are injured or maimed.  So if there are 100 deaths, then I'm guessing there's around 200 or so have complications.  Still, 500 seems kinda low considering deaths due to other things.
You know, if the trust issue is applied to all government and politics, rebuilding trust dissolves most the right wing thinking, but it involves listening and trying to figure out the other side of the story and not just labeling the other side as crazy.  It takes work though...
> The average person is emotional and doesn't weigh information like a scientist would.

Well, that implies a few things.  First, it implies that people cannot be trusted to think for themselves.  Second, it implies that a scientist needs to think or them.  Perhaps the solution is to find out WHY, weigh the information and help them (or yourself) come to a consensus.

You'll also have to remember that scientists can be bought off or fall prey to bad philosophical ideals (e.g. eugenics, and Tuskegee syphilis experiment).
The average person just wants to make informed decisions. That's impossible when you're deliberately and systematically being lied to. 
about the CDC....not really the most trusted source...especially on vaccine and autism.......http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Thorsen




Interesting. I didn't know about this one. The powers of Big Pharma. It's amazing what people can be roped into doing. I guess this sort of thing might be happening more than we want to think.
Well if that's the case, we can just prescribe a double dose of prozac! It's an anti depressant, after all ;) 
True, but you have to consider that the groups they were testing the drug on probably had been diagnosed with depression, rendering them already more likely to commit suicide. I'm not refuting the claims, just something to consider. 
Don't forget Eli Lilly marketing [Zyprexa](https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/Volume5_07_Mann.html) for off label use which lead to numerous deaths as well. 
Like how they hid the side effects of female hormone therapy from us for years. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935455/ 

"Dozens of ghostwritten reviews and commentaries published in medical journals and supplements were used to promote unproven benefits and downplay harms of menopausal hormone therapy"

"clinical trial reports were sometimes modified for marketing purposes."

It makes it so hard; who do we believe when we can't even trust the scientific articles written on it.
I don't see how a drug that stops you from hearing voices and thinking the government put listening devices in your fruit loops is gonna help with anorexia. 
Well, I'd chalk that up to my parents who never read anything and just assumed the doctor knew what she was talking about. Plus, I was just a kid who would do what was expected of me.
All I was told was that I'd be able to focus more in school, which was the primary complaint of my parents. I got no paper myself, just instructions on how to take my pills and how many I had to take. It wouldn't have mattered, I was such a vacant dope back then, the side-effects could have been growing an extra eye and it wouldn't have registered with more than a 'meh' in my mind.

Forgot to add Ritalin to the list of stuff they had me on, all prescriptions from the same doctor. I really can't conceive how all of these drugs would help me focus on anything since I was in such a daze from them.
buried in the middle of teeny tiny print. Doctors should really discuss what are the most likely side effects if they are going to dole out the meds especially if they are prescribing to a patient that has a mental disorder of some type. People may not be able to comprehend or even focus long enough to read. 

People throw them out because they don't think it can happen to them, they trust that their doctor would not prescribe something that would make their health worse. doctors should know what they are prescribing but so many are not worth the ink used to print their diploma, especially during the 00's. Now we have many people damaged by negligence of doctors, and we have many addicted to scrips because the doctors were ignorant of what they were doing. 

 pharmacology = the study of poisons
Aw, thank you. But hey, could've been worse.

Mmhm, that's certainly what it feels like, looking back. I wasn't even on Ritalin for that long before she prescribed the other ones and started upping the dosages. It was back when throwing pills at weird kids was at its most popular stage so I wouldn't be surprised. 
Yeah i'm not pretending to be any expert, obviously.. just seems we oughtta be a lil tougher on the big players.
Not just the drug they're going to swallow, the drug their CHILD is going to swallow. 
Yep, Viagra was originally meant to be a chest pain and hypertension drug. Getting a boner was just a side effect. 
Or reading about rare side-effects like they are commonplace. 
He's parodying libertarian philosophy.
Lawyers informed me that since I never went to the doctor with concerns while I was on the medication, I was not eligible for their class action lawsuit. I was about 14 at the time. I noticed soreness in my chest, but I figured it was just muscle growth back then. 

I haven't ever had my hormone levels tested. I don't really see a need to now. I have 2 kids so everything else seems to be functioning normally. Maybe one day I will be able to get a beard though. 
There are hallucinogens (THC) in weed that will probably be a bad idea for a psychotic.  On the other hand, the low THC/hallucinogen versions of weed have anti-psychotics.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a doctor, so people should do their reading.

Because it's a savage hypocrisy...the fact that big pharma LEGALLY produces drugs with side effects that are arguably worse than the disease itself, making money hand over fist. Meanwhile, a drug that has yet to cause a single fatality is still considered taboo because of some antiquated "war on drugs." However, I will say it has become increasingly acceptable though, but still absurd nonetheless.
That's not what this is. It's a drug that treats the diseases directly, but lacks the side effects that other drugs on the market now have.
And it would dry up juvenile sales overnight. Well, half of them anyway.
Consulting with a lawyer is generally free and they usually don't take cases they don't feel have a strong chance of winning or settling.
Fuuuuuuuuck that noise, friend. Almost all plaintiff's attorneys work on contingency fee basis - that means they don't spend your money or get paid until you win. 

And from the linked article and here, it sounds pretty slam dunk. 
There are ads on tv right now asking people if they've had side effects from that drug. Most probably the lawyers will be free and will take a cut. Do some internet research. Shouldn't be difficult to find. 
I've seen plenty of TV commercials for lawyers just begging to sue about this.   

They will work for free for a cut of the settlement. Prolly a class-action suit too.
There Are lawyers who specialize is cases for this drug,look into it, you deserve restitution 
You'll probably be part of a class action suit. Definitely speak with a product liability lawyer.
You might find out that there is a class action lawsuit, in which the fee is on a contingency basis of a win. Search risperdal and class action. There are in fact, such claims already made. 
Mike Papintonio from ring of fire radio specializes in these cases- you wont pay a dime.
Check out their webpage and send an email, you have nothing to lose. 
Fucking do it dude.  
You could consider a joint lawsuit with others who were deceived by this company.
Companies that large will typically settle rather than pay lawyers in cases like this.



A lot of civil suit lawyers will only take a percentage of the payout so you risk nothing except time off work. 
You can also sue for legal fees and hire good lawyers pro-bono. This also sounds like the recipe for a class action lawsuit.
Lawyers take cases like these on a contingency basis. You pay nothing unless you win/settle. Then you pay a percentage of whatever you get. There are a lot of cases right now. Statute of limitations should be a major factor for you right now. Do not wait! 
For whatever it's worth I saw a commercial yesterday of a class action suit against the makers of rispredol. I would definitely look into it though.
I mean, you realize what it DID, so will everyone else. How can J&J even win a case like this. That's beyond fucked.
I have known about this issue for like a year due to a reoccuring law office commercial begging anyone this has happened to to call them.  If lawyers are dropping money for TV ads they must think it's worth suing.
Hey man. Not sure if you saw, but a lawyer (or so he claimed) chipped in some advice in a reply to my first comment.   Hope you can get some compensation and help.
It may be worth checking the Facebook community page, "Canadian Risperdal Pending Lawsuit". Good luck!
There are plenty of firms actively looking for Risperdal victims. It probably won't take more than a phone call, a few pictures, and sending some medical records. I worked near a firm that was doing just that. 
im pretty sure in a case like yours lawyers will fight tooth and nail for free because thats gotta be open/closed case to win.
Dude I don't know about where you live but I see a commercial like every other day on TV advertising a law firm for Risperdol cases, pretty sure they all do it pro bono.
One of the J&J heirs is a pretty cool guy ,,, I know this is 'out there'  but maybe you could get in touch with this guy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Johnson_%28filmmaker%29
via FB or something, he just might be interested in 'helping' somehow

I'm really sorry to hear about your experience, hopefully things might change in time, our bodies are fuckin remarkable things, I've been through some crazy life threatening neurological stuff, I was completely paralyzed and 'shouldn't have got" as well as I *am* ... but you'd never know now, unless I tell you! Nerves have remarkable regeneration properties *and* cannabis IS known to have neuroprotective *and* neuroregenerative properties so I recommend smoking pot for numerous other reasons too

I did and it's the only 'variable' between me and 'normal' patients *who don't recover so well* ... hmmm

Our 'endocannabinoid system' is very important and very complex yet poorly understood, check it out in Wiki, it's worth learning about

I wish you all the best bro, I have a feeling you just might get a bit better with time, good luck
A good number of damages law firms will only accept a fee if you win.  Because they won't take your case unless you win.  It's definitely worth the time to investigate.  Good luck.
J&J is a big huge company who would love to write a big huge check to make your lawsuit go away.
I don't understand how you could not know this was a major side effect. As a health care professional I know this is the first thing people get warned about. 
Omg.I was diagnosed depressed but I was shit scared about taking anti depressants because of ask the side effects I read about anti depressants.

Even came close to suicide once but now I'm fine.
I know that PSSD has to be way more common than its perceived to be.  I've talked to a guy personally who took an SSRI for years and said that he doesn't give a shit about sex anymore.  He basically said its a waste of time.  And he wonders why hes so depressed.  

Oh and I also went to high school with a guy who identified himself as asexual.  I once heard him say he had been on SSRIs since he was a kid.  I didn't think anything of it at the time, but it all makes sense to me now.  It just boggles my mind how many SSRI users think its normal to have no sexual feelings whatsoever.  But you know SSRIs work by making you not aware of any kind of problem even sexually.

I'm coping by trying not to think of what has been stolen from me.  Its hard to not miss the euphoria of a constant libido and drive for love.  My emotional range was also muted by the SSRIs so I'm not as interested in relationships as much anymore.

Nothing whatsoever improves my PSSD.  I've had my testosterone checked and every other hormone and everything is perfect.  Its a brain problem caused by the SSRI.

I'm like you and have no idea how to even begin a lawsuit for this condition.  I suppose I would like to, but I don't know how I could win a case like this.  And there is also the embarrassment of the entire situation I think.  But with all that said, I will consider looking into a lawsuit for how Lexapro ruined my life.

There is a video of a guy on youtube who is apparently trying to get a lawsuit done for his PSSD.  He is trying to raise awareness of the condition while working on a case.  Here's a video of him:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3db98NVDMw
Just chiming in to say I was on Paxil for a few years, and then Cymbalta for four. At first it worked great, but after only a few months my dr had to start upping my dosage to get the same result. By year three I was pretty much detatched from all relationships. I was a zombie. I also developed crippling migraines. I decided I had had enough. I was at the highest daily dose, 120 mg daily. I knew it would suck to go off it, because I had missed a dose here or there, and would start withdrawal within a few hours. But I had *NO IDEA*.

 Cymbalta withdrawal was hands down one of the worst things I have ever gone through. I seriously considered suicide because I didn't think it would ever end. I had pretty severe symptoms for about five weeks. I was bedridden for three of them. I was fatigued, sick to my stomach, brain zaps (look it up), dizziness, hot and cold sweats. It was brutal. Thankfully I wasn't working because if I had been I would've been fired. 

I tell everyone who asks about Cymbalta, what I went through, because I don't think doctors have a clue that it happens. The company that makes it actively hid clinical results showing higher suicide rates in people going through withdrawal from Cymbalta. It's complete bullshit. I wasn't ever warned that it could happen, and I have what appears to be permanent personality changes. 

If your husband decides to stop taking it, have him check out cymbaltawithdrawal.com. It's the only thing that got me through. 
[deleted]
I took the SSRI Lexapro.  It was the worst experience of my entire life.  I still don't feel the same after the experience.

Be very careful trying to get your husband to come off Cymbalta.  The withdrawal of these drugs can make a person suicidal.  Have him talk with his doctor to work him off the drug safely.  Who knows he might be stuck on the drug forever.  That's how dependent a person can be once they start taking these things.  

Its ridiculous that doctors are putting people on drugs they can become suicidally dependent on.  These drugs do nothing, but put a person into an emotionless auto pilot in my opinion.  You do not care about anything while on them.  No more sadness and no more happiness.  Just emotionless content.  Can't even feel love on them.  Even once off the emotions still aren't as strong as before, but at least you don't feel as loopy.

I do agree if your husband is able that he should get off the antidepressants.  But he has to be **VERY** careful when doing so.  I mean **very** careful.  Have him talk with his doctor that prescribed it and see about tapering off it.  I was lucky myself and didn't take an SSRI long enough to become dependent on it.  But I still got horrible brain zaps and other withdrawal symptoms for a while afterwards.

I don't know if the damage has already been done to your husband, but you can try asking him about talking to his doctor about getting off the drug.


Any SSRI or SNRI class can cause sexual dysfunctions. If you are willing to explore other classes some of the Heterocyclics specifically: Bupropion, Mirtazapine and Vilazodone have notably lower incidences of sexual side effects than other antidepressants. 
Read "The Mood Cure," and try 5HTP, it's available over the counter and works.
Someone may have said this downthread, but Wellbutrin is often prescribed go people on SSRIs to combat side effects like sexual dysfunction. If Cymbalta is working otherwise for him, it might be a good idea to ask his doctor about this before changing meds because new meds are such a crap shoot. I never had sexual side effects, but Prozac made me sooo sleepy and the Wellbutrin made that go away entirely.

Xanax results in the same problem, though not to the same extent as Xanax causes it by blocking brain activity in general. 
I'd still advise you to talk to a lawyer about it, most of what is above relates to a person individually suing, but you still have at least one possible recourse: a class action lawsuit.

It will lower some of the risks associated with the cost for attorneys (you'd still be on the hook for further medical costs though), and may increase the possibility of a payout, as well as the sum of that payout.

I posted quotes earlier, and stated things as fact but forgot to add in my sources.

Most of it comes from a law review titled "Canadian Medical Malpractice Law in 2011: Missing the Mark on Patient Safety"

Which you can view here (PDF warning): http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3811&context=cklawreview

The direct source of the "quotes" is from The Tampa Bay Times:

Which is here: http://www.tampabay.com/news/canada-keeps-malpractice-cost-in-check/1021977
That's what lawyer are for.
Call ANY lawyer in the phone book, ask if they want part of a huge payout.
What do you mean? Get a solicitor and sue sue sue, all you have to say when you call them up is "I feel I have a cause to sue someone" you'll be hooked up with a solicitor straight away. Don't be scared of a corporate, they won't break your legs. And cases like this you can get a lawyer with no upfront costs, they take their cut after. It is 100% worth doing.
HCG/HMG can allow for fertility while using exogenous sex hormones. A SERM could also theoretically boost your LH and FSH levels. Synthetic testosterone is also not a 100% effective contraceptive either.
Man there's no reason that you should have to live with low testosterone in the year 2015.  You can buy supplements on the clearnet.  There are large, active subreddits dedicated to reviewing and discussing safe use of various supplements.  This can be fixed for you.
Brother I know you're dealing with a terrible issue that many people cannot understand in a tangible way....but please know that there are legal outlets you can take. As a user of this product, it would seem that any 'contract ' you agreed to through use of product, could be made null and void, by the subversive actions of the company. I could only imagine that dealing with this would be hard enough. But there are laws in place to protect you from things like this. You're rights and well being should not be placed above the corporate policies or the business model of any organization. Please at least consider looking into potential recourse. It seems that even simple societal rights, such a just compensation from harm due to widespread industrialized negligence, come thoroughly.
Yeah dude if I were in your predicament there's no way I'd not be on TRT.  I don't know what your insurance situation is but unless you have none you should be seeing an endocrinologist like tomorrow.  Get them to give you a huge bottle of cialis/viagra/whatever just to see if you can find something that works.  The TRT isn't just for sex stuff, low T is no way to live; let alone no T.
I've gathered from the comments below that if what you have  was caused by Risperdal then it isn't PSSD as Risperdal isn't an SSRI? I'm not sure if the damage done by the drugs is similar though.

At any rate, I've a number of other cognitive ailments complicating my ability to observe the progression of individual symptoms as accurately as I'd like, not to mention the various psychoactive supplements/medications I have taken since and am currently taking which complicate my cognitive landscape even further... But on the whole I'd say yes, it's gotten better. Not to the extent I might like, but when I had just come off Cymbalta (around July 2013) I felt next to nothing upon climax and my penis felt as though it had been anaesthetised. My sex drive is nowhere near as powerful as it was prior to taking it but then that may just be the settling down of my pubescent libido, and it is still plenty strong enough at times to be an unpleasant distraction. The pleasure I feel upon climax and during sex is still quite a bit less than what I used to feel though, but it's still reasonably enjoyable. One thing of note I guess is that I'm gay, and prior to Cymbalta I had a preference for being the top. Since stopping Cymbalta. I strongly prefer bottoming for the extra stimulation and more powerful climax it provides. 

Overall I really fucking wish I'd never  touched precscription meds for my depression, and I think it's absolutely fucked that GPs are able to prescribe such pwoerful life changing medications when they haven't anywhere near the knowledge or training to do so safely.
Wow. Lactation in males. Wow.
Because drug addicts ruin it for the legit people.  Benzos are totally legit for a real panic disorder.

Oh, and if you have a panic disorder, I was trained by my psychiatry professors that panic attacks often increase for the first few weeks after you start an SSRI.  Lovely, isn't it?

Edit: 

I'm not advocating routine benzo usage, especially not in general anxiety disorders.  And for the record i highly prefer vistaril over benzos due to better safety.  

My point is that putting everyone on an SSRI that has a few panic attacks a month is like putting people on routine Prilosec for occasional indigestion when Maalox would be adequate.


Not commenting on your situation because I don't know anything about it, but all benzodiazepines are classified as controlled substances because they are highly addictive and with long term use actually make anxiety worse  (rebound effect). 
The thing with diazepam is that even though, yes, it is very effective at treating panic attacks, it is also incredibly addictive both physiologically and psychologically (withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking 3-4 daily doses in some cases). There are other drugs of the same class that are less so. The "pam" drugs are central nervous system depressants, so if used with alcohol or other drugs or in individuals with certain medical conditions, they can be very dangerous. They can be some heavy stuff. Also, people do take diazepam for funsies, as crazy as that is. 
Sorry, I'm a grad student studying psychopharm right now and I love talking about this stuff. :)
Please.  Most of my patients put on atypical antipsychotics  are having it added as an adjunct for their antidepressant regimen *or are nonpsychotic pediatric patients.  This with a set of labs from their psychiatrist showing worsening diabetes, cholesterol, etc and then asking me to fix the problem.

If they are truly schizophrenic or psychotic, you have to do what you have to do to keep them alive immediately.

*edit
It works much better than many other medications for my schizophrenic brother. We are all glad he is on it, including him.
I don't know I haven't considered it. I've just been maintaining a healthy diet and exercise regularly. I'm still overweight but I'm thinner than I was when I was 13. I don't have money to throw around for lipo.

It's one of those things that is real, but is also widely self-diagnosed by people looking for an excuse. 
google thyroid function and obesity. weight loss is still possible with thyroid problems but its much more difficult. its not a myth. 
Yep! I had another friend who started lactating because she had a brain tumor! The tumor messed up her prolactin levels. 

I guess a lot of my friends have lactated. 
But... Invega Sustenna is a long-acting injection.
Risperdal is the most effective thing we've ever tried for my brother, who is schizophrenic. Although I'm sure it does cause problems for him, the benefits outweigh the risks by far.
I'm on risperdal now, started when I was 24 and I'm 36. I've had a lot of weight gain, possibly also because I have terrible eating habits, but basically put on 20kg in the past 10 years.

I don't have a huge sex drive, but I still get it on regularly. Although sometimes I do feel a bit, sexless. I'm also on 3mg and to be honest, I couldn't live without it.

What should I do? Should I see another psychiatrist for a different med?
That documentary brings up some good points, but it just devolves into depression-porn towards the end.
And how many people even if they tried are capable of being scientists of repute? 
So one "questionable" person accused. I see he was charged... but nothing else about it? So is this your only questionable area of the CDC?
We love to call out "Big Pharma", but pretty much anyone can do it. GM truck gas tanks in the 70's, Ford Pinto gas tanks, Deepwater Horizon, leaded anything prior to the 70's, Agent Orange, Karen Silkwood vs Kerr-McGee, and on an on. It's no just about bringing those who put others at risk to justice, it is about encouraging and protecting whistle blowers. Many of these risks were known though out the listed companies and no one spoke out. We must demand more accountability in all endeavors that impact health and safety.  
They thought of that. This is in comparison to people takin other antidepressants, not the general public. 
My mother is undergoing tests right now to determine if replacement therapy is responsible for her breast cancer. It has also been linked to higher rates of heart attack.
Well, anorexia nervosa is notoriously resistant to ssri therapy. Antipsychotics have been shown to be of effect. You also have to understand that these are used in patients who are in full-blown anorexia- mortality is 10%, I kid you not. And every moment spent at low body weight (edited: wrote bp erroneously earlier) has severe and irreversible effects on future heart and brain function.
How in hell? I'm a med student who just finished my psych rotation. At least ritalin makes sense for ADD and Luvox (fluxoxamine) does as well for anxiety disorders...those are text book prescriptions...but why in the fuck were you given risperadone, that just doesn't make any sense.

Like risperadone is only usually used for schizophrenia, severe bipolar and only in autism in patients who have SEVERE behavior problems, like if they are judged to be a danger to themselves or others. Baffling. 
He's ~~parodying~~ quoting libertarian philosophy.
Poe's Law rules the internet like a Righteous Tyrant.
Hi, I'm a lawyer. Quick consultation for you:

This is a good case. Find a lawyer who will do it for 20% or below contingency and sue them. Lawyers who charge a lot do so because of their resources. They know experts personally who can testify on your behalf.
I agree with this comment.  Plus, many lawyers will take such cases on a contingency, so you won't pay anything unless the lawyer wins/successfully negotiates a settlement.   In that cases he/she will take the fee out of the settlement/money you recover.  Also, in many cases you can have future medical expenses covered in addition to any settlement monies/money you recover.  
Doesn't this 'kill' the justice?
Those who do utilize such billing methods usually only take them on in slam dunk situations. 

Personally I like the hybrid approach. But I mostly so far have done patents on a royalty only basis with some punitive clauses if they fail to report earnings off of it.
Class action is not in the posters best interest. Class action suits are great for lawyers, not victims. 
Class action would suck. Attorney gets most money and plaintiff get very small amount. If possible I would go solo.
Not really. Companies that large tend to have a team of lawyers on salary, so they end up doing everything they can, from overwhelming the other side with paperwork, filing every sort of procedural hurdle, lowballing on settlement offers, etc. The company is paying the lawyers anyway, might as well make them work.

Thanks, I registered on their mailing list.
I doubt that I could get in touch with him but thanks for the kind words!
I knew it was a side effect while I was taking it. I didn't know it was a permanent thing.
That's not true. I was never told about this when I was started on SSRIs. I had read it can cause a drop in libidos and ED while on them. I didn't know it was something that could be permanent. 

So, it seems maybe a lot of doctors don't know this and don't look shit up before prescribing? How hard is it to pick up a fucking book out of a draw, look up a particular drug and read the information? They've tot it in the fucking office. This is a little infuriating. I've had like no sexual drive for a few years now, but I can still get erections occasionally so I think it's just my depression, at least I hope
After I got out of hospital - I just got put on them... I guess for some people in that situation, the MD doesn't want them knowing what they could do, and are aiming to get them stable.
Young kids growing up and not even having the capacity to understand what has been taken from them. Thank you for posting, such an eye opener.
Yea the testosterone and the PSSD are separate things which could make the other one worse if you have both, I'm not sure. I'm sexually dead. I'm unable to get aroused or have erections anymore which means no masturbation or sex. You're right about it being embarrassing, it's hard to even talk about with doctors who blame it on other things if they haven't heard of PSSD.
I'm so glad that I came across this comment. I started taking SSRIs when I was about nine and identified as asexual for a time in college before realizing that medications could be the problem. Now I just don't know Even in the fleeting moments I wasn't on medication, I never had any sexual interest. This is something I plan on looking into more. 


On a side note, I did also take risperdol for a while. Gynocomastia wasn't a problem because I'm female, but it did make me lactate. At 15 years old. 
Oh my god the brain zaps!! I dread them more than anything. 2 weeks before my Lexapro prescription runs out I begin to panic and start saving half doses just in case for some reason I can get my refill.
Wow. Do I ever feel better about treating my depression with functional alcoholism and bong tokes.
He's currently on 60 mg daily and has been for about a year and half, but his doctor wants up to either up the dosage or try him on a different class of drugs. With the side effects of this drug, he's very leery of either option and frustrated with his doctor (as am I, honestly. It was nice while it worked, but it kills me now to see him lose the joy in his life). I'm getting him a gym membership for his birthday in a couple weeks, and we've been talking about cutting some expenses to pay for therapy to help him with his depression, and hopefully we can figure out a way to wean him off this slowly. I am checking out that website for ideas on how to help him cope, thank you for that. 
That sounds terrible? Did you stop taking it all together or did you taper off of it?
Paxil....holy shit the worst two weeks of my life were when I ran out of my prescription and my "doctor" was out of town. I didn't think it would be a big deal so I just halved what I had left.

Two straight weeks of feeling like I just got off a merry go round. No clue how I managed not to get fired. Never again.
>  I wasn't ever warned that it could happen, and I have what appears to be permanent personality changes.

How long have you been off of it? 
Thank you for your advice. He really wants to get off of them asap, because he feels that emotionless void starting to kick in and it's killing him. We have two children and one on the way and he hates that there are some days he feels no joy or excitement about this pregnancy, and some days he's so aloof about our kids he'll cry the next day because he feels terrible about it. So I don't think it's caused permanent damage to him yet, but I will be sharing some of the information in this thread to help him make a decision because I know he would be devastated to feel like that all the time. It would kill him.  

Thankfully our lines of communication are very open and he's been divulging all of his problems to me, so I have been doing research and asking around about his different options. He's already asked me to go with him to his next doctor's visit (he knows he's too introverted to speak up for himself most of the time, and I'm, well...*not*), so I guess we'll take it from there.
Whoa there! Ask the bar association for a recommendation. Don't just pick at random. Lotta dumb ass lawyers out there
Johnson and Johnson should buy him testosterone for the rest of his life. 
Well he said he was from Canada, so why not review with a proper physician and get Testosterone back on track?
The damage may already be done. If this happened during puberty, then his development is irreversibly wrecked. Raising his testosterone levels now wouldn't help much.
Thanks, it's hard to live with a condition that you can't really talk or vent about to anyone, it gets really frustrating. It feels like being an alien, I've kept distance from the opposite sex because of it. How long have you been using it? Have you noticed any side effects?
It's similar to PSSD but there's no official name for it. I definitely agree that GPs shouldn't be prescribing that shit.
Males coukd always lactate. You dont need drugs to do it either, just some effort.
When the other option is a lifetime of psychosis that starts to sound like less and less of a big deal. Also, it's a very rare side effect. 

We're hearing a lot from the people who who've experienced the side effect but not much from the many, many people this drug has helped. 
Also because the DEA has made every Dr in America afraid to actually prescribe. Also benzos are highly addictive, don't do anything but band aid the real problem and have withdrawals that can kill you. Yes taking Xanax once every week or 2 is fine but they aren't a long term answer for anxiety only for the actual panic attacks. 
Or maybe ridiculous drug policy and stigma ruins it for legit patients?
You might want to consider a lawsuit.  Seriously.
You should *definitely* consider a lawsuit, especially if you have that in writing from your endocrinologist. 
could always do like a kickstarter or something. hell one dude raised $55,000 to make himself some potato salad. 

good work on maintaining the healthy lifestyle though. you are better than i.
Huh, then what has my sister been taking? 
Risperdal is the only/most effective antipsychotic I found to help me with my psychotic episodes too. I tried Abilify, Zyprexa, and something else, and they didn't help at all. My quality of life is a lot better, even if there are other risks or weight gain.
All meds have side effects.  It took me years to find the right combo that helps my condition with acceptable side effects.  It's up to you to decide if the meds are helping and the side effects are acceptable.  You don't have to switch doctors to switch meds.  I have gained weight, but mostly because I eat shitty and don't exercise enough. My tits aren't bigger than they should be.  I'm 35 BTW.  I think the big titties happen more with younger patients.

he is responsible for many vaccine autism studies. The scientific evidence that vaccines don’t cause autism rests on a thief. CDC is going to have to redo those studies with people that we can trust. 

plus, the the head of the CDC that these studies were run went to work for Merk. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/21/us-merck-gerberding-idUSTRE5BK2K520091221

put those two facts together your scientific studies appear to be tainted.

Anyone paying attention to what Bush jr was doing they would be suspicious of any scientific work done under his administration.he placed so many political lackies in top science positions, All those studies need to be re-examined. 
From approximately February 2004 until February 2010, Poul Thorsen executed a scheme to steal grant money awarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC had awarded grant money to Denmark for research involving infant disabilities, autism, genetic disorders, and fetal alcohol syndrome. CDC awarded the grant to fund studies of the relationship between autism and the exposure to vaccines, the relationship between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy, and the relationship between developmental outcomes and fetal alcohol exposure. 


ho has been accused of financial fraud, and who co-authored some of the most frequently cited studies concluding that there is no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, nor between the MMR vaccine and autism. 

let those facts sink in before you tout "studies prove there is no link" 




There have been lawsuits started on HRT. Not sure about the status but there are information out there on this. http://www.estrogen-replacement-side-effects.com/html/lawsuit.html and http://www.nationalconsumerlawyers.com/hrt/lawsuit/
My grandmother had a hysterectomy when she was 30 or so, and then had to stay on hormones since she had no uterus. Well, she got breast cancer.  I always thought they were related. 
Oh, congrats on finishing! Great job~
Exactly! That's what made me so mad when I read about what the pills were actually intended for. I'm high-functioning and really had no behavioral problems except "focus" problems. But what teen who doesn't give a rat's ass about school doesn't have that problem, right?
 I was certainly not depressed in any way, before that I never had hallucinations or paranoia of any kind. Nothing I exhibited around that age would prompt anyone to believe I had severe behavioral problems, let alone a bipolar personality or schizophrenia. Doesn't schizophrenia typically develop in your early 20s anyway? Childhood cases are pretty rare from what I know, I was maybe 15-16 when I was on that stuff. It's really turned me off to trying any new meds. Irrational for sure, but that junk really messed me up and I'm afraid to expose myself to anything else.

In reply to your last paragraph: REALLY?! I was given to to combat trichotillomania (I was already on 60mg of celexa for depression) at about 15 years old. What the actual fuck. 
You obviously don't understand libertarianism. Like most people you see them as a bunch of crazies without actually knowing what most of them stand for.
This will be sucked up in a MDL and be a headache to work up. 
Maybe a little, but it also makes it efficient. If every person who thought they had grounds to sue ended up in court, the system would be paralyzed. If your case is bullshit, expect to be paying a large retainer. 
If a lawyer doesn't think you have strong ground to stand on in court, you probably don't. It stops a lot of cases of 'OH YEAH WELL I'LL SUE' and they just have bullshit reasons for doing it.

A case like this, where a prescription drug clearly caused a permanent disability/dysfunction? they're all over that like a sunburn on an Irishman.
No. Why would you want people suing if they have little to no chance of winning?
So does needing lots of money to pay for it....

If only top lawyers got some sort of social charisma for taking 10% of jobs as free.
They are also 'great' for the company being sued.  It allows them to clump all legal action into a single one allowing their internal resources to be spent more efficiently.  Great being in quotes as they would obviously prefer no lawsuit to any lawsuit against them.
Settlement usually brings in a lower fee for the lawyer, sometimes 33% vs 50% of going to trial. THEN they subtract all the fees from the plaintiffs side, not their own fees. Then you divide that by all the plaintiffs. The individual law firms will make tens or hundreds of millions, while each individual patient will get a few thousand. 
If you've been screwed over a lot, solo is better.

Class action does have a place though -- if Comcast cheats 7.8 million people out of $200 each, it's probably not worth it for an appreciable number of them to sue.  In a class action case, however, most of the point is to screw over comcast, the lawyers do all the work and the people affected get a bit of restitution.

If you view class action as a penalty lawsuit rather than a restitution lawsuit it makes a lot more sense.
I just saw a post by peacesreese on nottheonion regarding a large settlement for a man who grew breasts after taking risperdal. it was posted 6 hrs ago... hope you're making progress!
That makes sense
There's no way a doctor didn't know this. It's literally the number one side effect. They teach it on the first day practically. 
Sad to say but yes it's true that for every drug prescribed Doctors do indeed no the side effects. But depending on the disease they decide whether it's worth the risk or not having their patient take the prescribed drug.
It's up to the doctor to weigh the pros and cons before putting you on them, but part of your discharge education should have been on your new meds. Possible side effects should be drilled into during your stay and again before your release. 
The antidepressant and asexuality link has been studied by researchers.  Here's a link to an article discussing how antidepressants could be contributing to the rise in asexuality in people:

http://wp.rxisk.org/asexuality-a-curious-parallel/

Also studies on rodents have shown that when they are exposed to an SSRI antidepressant in their youth they showed little to no sexual behavior in their adulthood.  Another study gave pregnant rodents SSRI antidepressants and their offspring showed no sexual behavior in their adulthood either.

Dude all this discussion is a waste of time. This is everything you should be telling to a lawyer. Stop making excuses, don't spend another second not calling lawyers. If the case is legit you will have many of the best wanting to fight for you. GET A LAWYER NOW!
Just think if AD's where part of the problem of lowering population...
They are truly awful. I really wish it was something they understood, but I would probably be horrified if I ever found out! I would get them within about 12 hours of missing a dose, so I know what you mean with having panic attacks. One mess up or misunderstanding or missed appointment, and you're up shit creek. E-hugs from a fellow brain zap sufferer. <3
Haha I don't know about the alcohol, but it appears as though marijuana might help depression, so you're self medication might actually have some science to back it up. I hope you feel better soon. 
I am really sympathetic. I have a chronic pain condition, which was the original reason for starting Cymbalta, and have gradually become bedridden over the past year or so. Needless to say, it's easy to slip into depression when you are 35 and bedridden, but I will never take another antidepressant. I think it's wonderful that it is a miracle drug for some people. I'm just not one of them. I will do therapy, but my trust of depression drug treatments have been shattered. 

If the Cymbalta is not working as well then his only options are to 1) keep going with no changes 2) try a new med 3) up his Cymbalta dosage. If I had it to do over, I would've gotten off of it so much sooner. It really never worked as well as it did those first few weeks. Upping the dosage helped maybe the first week, but I was soon back in the slump. All I had to show for it was an eventual withdrawal from hell. Of course there might always be one that is worse for him than it would be for me. In all my research over the last few years, it looks like Paxil and Prozac have the fewest complaints. I don't know how you guys feel about either those. 

 A tough lesson I have had to learn is that if you don't fight for yourself, no one will. I have to be my own vocal advocate. If you aren't willing to immediately speak up about your concerns, it might be too late when you finally do. We have to keep our own best interest in the forefront. Doctors might feel like they know all that they need to know, but that's not always the case. If his doctor isn't responsive, I guarantee there is another one out there who would be. 

Living with chronic pain has really opened my eyes to some of the flaws in the way we practice medicine here in the U.S. And while there are tons of awesome doctors here, there are also tons of shitty ones. Some who "know" what is in their patients best interest, despite never actually *listening* to that patient. You have to be proactive when you come across one of these. It's all too easy to be misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated, all the while continuing to suffer, before finally finding out what was *actually* wrong. I'm not saying that's what is going on here, just Something to keep in mind. 

My advice is ask your husband what he wants to do. Research Cymbalta longterm side effects/Cymbalta withdrawal and other potential medications/treatments together. Help him make a decision about what he thinks is the right course of action. It sounds like you both are done with it, though. 

If you guys decide its best to stop taking it, then he needs to make it clear to his doctor. Having you there for support could be a huge boost in his confidence in this regard. We are taught at a young age to respect our doctors and what they say, and it can be hard to not be swayed by a doctor you have put your trust in. 

If the doctor is unwilling to work with him, find another doctor. Period. You need a doctor who is an ally, not a parent who just does "what's best" for you. They should be receptive to *any* concerns. Especially in regards to brain-altering medications. 

It's been a little over a year since I last took it, but I believe you can only get Cymbalta in capsule form, not tablets. That hinders people from weaning off slowly (the cynic in me thinks that was done purposefully). So people have come up with "bead counting". Basically, this shit is so potent, if you go cold turkey it will probably be bad. So, to counteract that, you have to pop them open and remove something like 5 little beads and take the rest. You do this for a few weeks, then start removing 10 little beads. Etc, etc until you finally stop. It's a huge hassle but really the only option. Again check out that website. There are tons of threads devoted to different aspects of making it through the withdrawal. 

So, I'm sorry I kinda went off on a rant there. It's hard not to when you feel you've been harmed, and see others going through the same thing. Your husband is lucky to have you. Having a loving SO who's got your back is an enormous comfort, and as a fellow sufferer I thank you for your patience and love for him. People like you make all the difference in our world.

 If you ever want someone's outside input, feel free to pm me. I won't necessarily have an answer but I can always listen. Good luck! You'll do fine, I'm sure. 

Edit: wish him a happy early birthday for me! :)
Yeah, this is the problem with Cymbalta: when it works, it works well. When it stops working, you're fucked. Jumping off the drug after tapering down to 20mg is usually still too steep for most people; I had to open up my capsules and divide the beads for two more dosage steps down, and still had a pretty ugly withdrawal afterwards. 
I went cold turkey. I replied in another comment about the circumstances, but basically I had a problem getting my prescription filled and by the time I could get it, I was already in full blown withdrawal, so I decided to just keep going. 

It was terrible, but it didn't kill me at least. If I can help even one other person who is going through it, then it was worth it. :)
I'm sorry you had to go through that. It is a miserable experience. :(
It was one year ago September 2nd. So almost a year and a half. 
I'm seeing an endocrinologist right now but living a life where I have to take injections or patches because of some dumb medicine sucks, I'm not even sure if increasing the testosterone will have an overall positive effect on my health but I'm working on it.
If OP is Canadian, he should just do things himself.  Gear for personal consumption isn't even illegal in Canada, and it might take a long time to get an appointment with an endocrinologist with their socialized system.
well like the old adage goes: when at first you don't succeed, you hop on tren
I'm sorry brother I'be never used the medication before. I just don't want you to give up. Fuck these companies. I'm sure there legal routes out there for you if you so choose. 

How long have you been off it, and have there been any changes in your condition over time? 
Regular Invega is a pill, but Invega Sustenna is an injection.
Thanks very much.
Probably actually because she had no ovaries rather than no uterus. 
Thanks for sharing. Women should talk about this more. 
Eh...don't be too afraid, I'd just always make sure to first look up side affects of any new drug and then DIRECTLY ask the Dr about any you are concerned about. A shockingly high number of patients either don't bother or are afraid to ask it's a little sad/scary in my opinion. 
What they believe and what they practice are two entirely different things.  And the most prominent advocates of libertarianism today are practicing behavior that I believe are destructive to society in the long term.
Ah, yes, the ol' vexatious litigants...
No, only the current system would be paralyzed by an increased workload.

We could very easily multiply the capacity of our court system by a hundred fold or more. It's just that we've adopted a minimalist approach.

(It's almost amazing how nimble our current system is — a locale of 500,000 may be served by a smaller building than a CVS and with fewer staff than a Walmart.)
and this is exactly what J&J is doing. paying up because they know their defense case is bullshit.
haha the system is already paralyzed.  "speedy trial" has become a bureaucratic joke, no wonder people have become so cynical.
Because it might be just? It's not like the underdog can't ever be the good guy.
I was also 11-12 when I started on SSRIs so I didn't have much say in the matter.
Of all SSRIs? 
My doctor switched me from an SSRI dopamine re uptake inhibitor. Told me there would be no withdrawal from the lexapro. Man was he wrong.
Things are done differently in the UK. It was over 10 years ago too.
Very interesting. I have no sexual interest but it doesn't really bother me either. I can still get aroused and all that, just no need to use it for anything. I only recently went back on ssris. I had been on them all through my teenage years. I took them for ocd so I didn't really have depression anyway. 
Geez, let OP talk about it with people who can relate. He knows about the lawyer advice and plenty of people have already weighed in on what he can expect regarding compensation and such. It honestly doesn't look good.
He's Canadian. At most he might end up with a few thousand bucks. 
It actually took six months for me to stop having brain zaps. I would describe it to doctors and they just looked at me like I was insane. "Do you think someone is running electricity through your brain?"

No, motherfucker, I'm depressed, not psychotic. They literally did not believe that it was an actual symptom, yet it was what I felt for almost half a year. Scary how some doctors aren't educated on the side effects.
It is sad that people are told drugs are the only option for depression. I was told this too about my mental illness, but this book helped me a lot to figure out how to go about it naturally and it has worked 100 times better than any drug could ever work. With 0 side effects might I add. The only reason this type of treatment is not standard is simply due to drugs being able to make more money, which is sad. You can't charge 100$ for a bottle of a natural supplement that can't be patented.

Withdrawal from these drugs can last a very long time, and it sounds like your case was quite bad. Assuming you're not on any SSRIs anymore, it's perhaps possible that you're stil going through prolonged withdrawal. 
Hey dude, I hope this isn't unwelcome - check out /r/steroids. Don't let the common public misconceptions of these drugs put you off. Just go look, do a search for peoples' experiences with TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy). They're a very positive, helpful bunch over there - exactly what a sub should be. 

There are products like Sustanon that let you inject very infrequently while still maintaining reasonably stable Test levels. 

I won't claim to have been in your boat, but I think you'll find most experiences with TRT have been life changing in a overwhelmingly positive fashion.
You just gotta keep up with it man and positivity is a great way to help. I know its easy for me to say from an outside perspective, but ya keep trying and keep ya head up.
> living a life where I have to take injections or patches because of some dumb medicine sucks

Ehh, on the bright side there's a decent chance that your natty levels would have tanked on their own when you got to your thirties.  Injections aren't bad at all.  I have a feeling you will be much happier if you pursue this route.
No, our triage system actually works very well in most provinces (we actually don't have a national medical system, each province has its own medical system).

For instance I waited 1 week for an appointment with a gastroenterologist. When I was younger, waited 3 days for a pediatric cardiologist.

If you have an actual issue, care is fast. The people who complain about wait times are those who either abuse the ER (I would say a good 60% of people in an ER at any given time should not be there, every day it is full of stuffed noses and flu bug cases. Go to your family physician.), or on a non-life threatening wait list such as hip replacement.

Tl;Dr., crazy wait times largely a misunderstanding, people don't know how to use our medical system.
Incorrect.

Around 4.5 months now. Nope, same shitty functioning.
Yeah, that too. :P 

She went through a total hysterectomy. I was even typing that and going, "wait, the uterus doesn't control hormones. Whatever."

She's cancer free though, since September 2012 I think. She had an annual mammogram and it was globular something carcinoma, so it wasn't a lump, but a web of cancer. She got a mastectomy and reconstruction at the same time. She also had some lymph nodes removed in her armpits. She didn't have to do chemo and radiation.
Yes. Birth control and cancer are two things that are so taboo. 
Yeah, for sure. I'd much rather know the risks now, especially after what I went through. Probably doesn't help at all that I was a teen when all of this was going down. I'll most likely have better results as an adult. 

That *is* shocking! So many drugs run the risk of killing you, why wouldn't you want to know if you're taking something that could do that? One GOOD side-effect of this experience is I'll know now to always ask before exposing myself to anything. Luckily, I manage my life pretty well so I don't see myself choosing to take on any new meds but hey, who knows?
> Ah, yes, the ol' vexatious litigants...

Look on the bright side. If you talk to a lawyer and they agree to take your case while getting paid only if they win you can be sure that you are not being a vexatious litigant. Your good to go. Only worry about being a vexatious litigant if you pay a big up front retainer.

That I'm aware of. There may be new ones are the market-- what I know is they decrease libido-in men and women. You can also get seretonin syndrome and die. 
I'm glad that you finally have relief from them, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. :(
I haven't read this. Thank you for sharing. I will have to look into it. I'm glad you are feeling better. :)
I've thought about whether I still am having lingering withdrawal. I am not on any SSRIs anymore. I try not to dwell on the possibility, because I get angry if I do.

 It was very bad. My dr faxed my normal script to Walgreens on a Friday after my visit. Went to Walgreens the following day to pick it up (couldn't go Friday because insurance won't pay if I go early). Walgreens claims to have never received the script, and that I need to contact my dr office. Well it was a three day weekend so Tuesday was the first day their office would be open. 

By noon on Saturday I was feeling the first withdrawal symptoms, dizziness, brain zaps, nausea. By Sunday I was running a low grade fever, and had decided I was fed up with worrying about getting the prescription and dealing with immediate withdrawal. So my mind was made up. 

I never had any idea it would be *so bad*. I figured I might feel shitty for a week or so, and then feel better. By the middle of the following week I had learned how mistaken I was. I had never been informed about the dangers of going cold turkey from these medications. The fact that they hand these prescriptions out so readily led me to the false conclusion that they were safe. 

In a way I kind of hope it is still withdrawal, because that means there is hope that I will one day return to the "old me", but on the other hand, the thought that the pharma companies and doctors could be so careless with our wellbeing makes me furious. So I don't know which would be the preferable outcome. I probably will never know anyway. Thanks for your input!
Thanks, had no idea about that subreddit, TRT is one of the options I'm considering.
> Ehh, on the bright side there's a decent chance that your natty levels would have tanked on their own when you got to your thirties.

That's just not true for normal healthy males. See [this](http://elitemensguide.com/assets/Testosterone-Levels-by-Age.png) table.
I hear you. Every time I hear someone mention they went to the doctor because they had some minor ailment, it pisses me off. A Coworker of mine had a minor stomach bug and actually said this to me today, "I went to the doctor yesterday, I know there's really nothing he could do, but I went anyway." The why the fuck did you go and waste his time and tax payer money?!! I agree with the idea of universal healthcare but I think that we should charge a basic fee for doctor visits, maybe $50 or something just to deter the fucking idiots who abuse the system.
He's mostly right. They're Schedule IV in Canada

"Schedule IV: It is not an offence to possess a Schedule IV substance for personal use; however, Subsection (2) of Section (4) of the CDSA states that "no person shall seek or obtain a substance or authorization from a practitioner to obtain a substance in schedules I through IV." unless the person discloses to the practitioner particulars relating to the acquisition by the person of every substance in those Schedules, and of every authorization to obtain such substances, from any other practitioner within the preceding thirty days. Subsection (7) then states that it is an indictable offence to contravene subsection (2). Therefore, it is an indictable offence to attempt to acquire a Schedule IV substance but not an offence for possession. Section 5 provides that possession for the purpose of trafficking of a Schedule IV substance is an offence."

Illegal to sell or buy, but fine to possess, as long as it is without intent to distribute
I'm glad to hear she is in remission! That's great!

My mom had to have a full hysterectomy after a miscarriage became infected. She was on HRT for a while, but so far so good. 

I'm really glad it worked out (well, considering!) for your Mom!
Because they need them?
>That I'm aware of.

But you're a doctor.  Do you stop learning after the "first day?"  So you've already admitted you *don't* know the full spectrum of drugs out there, yet you're adamant that <random doctor> would know something about a class of drugs that you fully admit you're not completely read up on?  
Get blood work done to check your testosterone levels before you consider that as an option without any medical advice.
The best thing we can do is to increase funding to general practitioners. Everyone should have a family doctor, and they should be the first line of defense.

You will always have morons go to the gp when they don't need to, but that is better than going to the ER. It costs less, and they have better rounded knowledge and track your health record. Even "nothing" appointments can indicate serious things over time. The er is not equipped to deal with this, your family doctor is.

Right now in every jurisdiction In Canada, we are lacking family doctors. This is because we pay far more for specialists. Specialists are great to have, but they only work when there is a proper triage system. We *must* have well trained and available family physicians for everyone in order for the medical system to work properly. The GP is the cornerstone of health care, and unfortunately we under fund them in Canada. 

Now that I am thinking of it as well, we need far more nurse practitioners with better pay to assist family clinics in a multidisciplinary setting.

I don't prescribe these drugs. I'm not that kind of provider. But i think anyone with even the slightest bit of knowledge of pharmacology-- a first semester nursing student, knows that the number one side effect of ssri's is sexual disfunction. 
Most MD's ,upon specializing, focus on medications, procedures, disorders, and medical information relevant to their type of practice. Doctors are people too! Sometimes they need to look up information to remember certain aspects of a medication.

However, I'm sure there are doctors who omit the education portion when prescribing a med. 

I just don't want you to think that just because this particular doctor is incompetent just because he/she isn't up to date on the most cutting edge anti-depressant/anti-psychotic medication. 
Yep, got the blood work done but that's good advice for anyone else who feels compelled to take up TRT.

Antibiotics in the -floxacin group (including Cipro and Levaquin) have this incredibly rare but serious side effect. They are incredibly useful though. 
Can confirm .. I quit taking it but had to get steroid shots for a ruined tendon in my right arm and it took a year for the pain to go away.
I had a reaction to Levaquin that resulted in a pulled but not torn Achilles. Damn that hurt - and for a long time. Weirdest thing I ever experienced from a medicine. I didn't know what had happened until something like six months later when a friend mentioned this is a known possible side effect.
Levaquin saved my life.   I developed a serious case of E-Coli during a urinary tract infection(!).   Not much else to do then, but might think differently next time. 
Crazy how close the FDA and CDC have become with "Big Pharma". After this latest NFL concussion stuff and all the different doctors they are able to get to lie for them it really makes me wonder how much is just passed thru for profit. 
This country has continued to allow companies like Johnson and Johnson to plague the public's welfare with products that contain questionable ingredients. To endanger the health of children and others is despicable to me and we must stand up to it. 
Isn't there a revolving door at the FDA for drug company executives?
The fuck is the Federal Drug Administration? Margaret Hamburg is the ex chief of the FOOD AND Drug Administration.
It's unbelievable that this can't, after a fair trial, result in prison time. It's clear that fines don't work. 
I was prescribed Cipro for a mild UTI about five years ago, and I had a horrible reaction to it where I was incredibly itchy for weeks after. I took a break from running after googling the itchiness I was experiencing and seeing what it could do to your tendons, and I've never been able to get back into running without injuring a tendon since. I've always wonders if this drug is the cause, but I have no proof. 
Levaquin is a serious antibiotic. It definitely has it's uses, but I was prescribed it this year and it fucking destroyed me. I had severe insomnia (one-two hours of sleep a night), night terrors, incredible stomach pain in my right upper abdomen,  rashes, peripheral neuropathy (pinprick pain in my hands and feet), and I even has a brief hallucination immediately after waking (the dream kind of continued into reality for about 10 seconds, was super fucked).

Yeah, I had a pretty bad reaction to it. I had to switch onto an entirely different family of antibiotics, due to these crazy hypersensitive reactions. It's powerful stuff.
Welp. Currently on a 3 week regimen of Levaquin. Didn't get any warning about side effects except that it might make me sensitive to sunlight. Would have been nice if I knew about the whole EXPLODING MOTHERFUCKING TENDONS part...I run a lot and lift weights so now I'm paranoid as hell. No crazy side effects yet though, hopefully it stays that way.

I can't imagine any industry paying fines equal to drug companies and banks and yet nobody goes to jail. 
Too bad we don't have a real justice system to actually prosecute and penalize these wrong doers. Usually the judges just convict them so they'll agree to a bigger fine. 
I was prescribed levaquin for a sinus infection back in 2003.  I went on vacation to Florida and nobody warned me to stay out of the sun.  I ended up having to go to the emergency room with severe abdominal pain - it felt like the immediate aftermath of getting kicked in the balls.  I thought it was a hernia or a ruptured appendix, but nothing indicated that.  Turns out it was the levaquin.  That went away after about 24 hours or so.  Then I developed a rash all over my upper body that itched uncontrollably for close to a week.  I was absolutely miserable.  I will never knowingly take that shit again.
I've seen a few folks whose achilles tendons just MELTED after taking this shit post op.
This is the face of evil.
Here some false beliefs about the drug:

* 2-3 pills cant harm me. It needs to be more. No. Already 1-2 pills can do permanent harm to your body

* if i experience a side effect, then i stop and everything is fine. No. If you experience a side effect it might be too late already. You might need months or years to recover, if you can at all

* If i didnt have side effects during taking the pill, then everything is fine. No. Most tendon ruptures happened 8 days after finishing th drug, 85% within the month after, and even a year after is accounted as side effect.

* I took it once and everything was fine. Certainly i can take it again without worries. No. There are ppl that had no problems first time but got serious side effects when taking it again years after
If I've taken Levaquin in the past year does this mean I'm about to get a check in the mail? Because that would be cool beans....
Last October I woke up with both ankles/calves mottled, red and swollen to the knees.  Not thinking emergency rooms in order I went to the 'Doc in a Box'.  He said 'Cellulitis!", took blood and gave me a low level anti-biotic.  The next day he called and said the tests showed an inflammation triggered something-or-other which indicated a greater issue and told me to pry my way into my primary care physicians three week waiting period and get something stronger.  

my primary looked and poked and said 'Cellulitis' while telling me this anti-biotic, which I absolutely had to take, had a side effect of permanent tendon damage.  Yikes.  I bought  a bottle of this shit and took one.  

Later that day I realized that I didnt have an infection of any kind,  despite what the adamant doctors said.  What I had was a new stand up desk and an ols location for my low output space heater.  Id turned it on when the temp dropped and slowly sunburned both of my legs.  It was burns, not infection.  Yet, Id been reflexively given two different anti-biotics, one of which is nasty.  Im glad I didnt take it.  

When are you motherfuckers going to learn? Don't take drugs... but especially don't take prescription drugs. It just isn't smart.
***RANT***
Honestly you should never really trust doctors or the FDA. Do your own research, become your own doctor. In almost every scenario, people would never need doctors if they just stopped eating processed foods, started exercising daily, grew their own fruits/veggies, and avoided anything that isn't natural to this earth. The problem is if you're eating crap every single day of your life and bathing in toxins, using toxins to wash your clothes, using toxins to wash your dishes, eating pesticide ridden foods, etc, you're going to become sick some day no matter what. You'll get cancer and be so surprised but if you look back, you can pinpoint why. Wake up. Look into literally every single product you have in your home and make sure they're all totally natural. Think about how humans lived 10,000 years ago and strive to live more like that. We've come so far with these advances in modern medicine and yet cancer is the number one killer and we ALL know somebody that has fallen victim to cancer. That didn't happen 100 years ago much at all. So why should it happen now?
And they have had black box warnings of this rare side effect since 2008. This information is easily found in a physicians desk reference, epocrates, and the drugs own website. The real question is did the FDA and drug company know of this before adding the black box warning. Informed consent is important in medicine, having said that there is no way of knowing if this rare event will happen and I think most if not all would have accepted treatment given the odds. Warnings of possible rare side effects with no way of knowing who they will effect are needed but easy to brush off. 

As someone with a severe and potentially lethal allergy to penicillin-based antibiotics, cipro, levaquin, and other similar drugs are a life saver. 
> in the -floxacin group 

We call those fluoroquinolones 


One of the people here in the world literally highly allergic to nearly every every antibiotic on the planet expect those quinolone family. Without them my life would be really bad. I have to do everything I possibly can to prevent becoming sick as their are some illnesses that the flouro's just don't work well against, ear infections for example. 

A few years ago I came down with a double ear infection, never had one in my life, ended up with 2 at the same time go figure. They couldn't really prescribe Levaquin as it's not something that really works for that very well. As a child I was highly allergic to penicillins but they wanted to try Bactrim anyway, they gave me a pill but wanted me to stay for observation for reactions, they didn't see anything after 3 hours so sent me home. Went home, went to bed, woke up 6 hours later to my skin peeling off like I had sever burns all over my body. Was extremely uncomfortable. They ended up switching me to something else, I can't remember what it was to be honest, by that point between the fever and everything else I was fairly delirious.

I've had an eye infection that required Levaquin eye drops as well, those are pretty hard to find... 
You are lucky that just the arm was affected. I can hardly walk and have pain in both arms
Fosfomycin or Macrobid are other options, depending on how far up the infection gets. Fosfomycin is one dose.
> Crazy how close the FDA and CDC have become with "Big Pharma". 

You mean how easily Big Pharma moved into the government offices. Regulation doesn't work because the regulator used to work for the corporations, and would like to again some day.
It's funny. You assume guilt.  I assume greed and bad science (by the plaintiffs).  
But who should go to jail? There are countless people involved here.
Prison time? Ha. Prison is for poor, oppressed people only. Didn't you know that? U musta missed the last twenty million news stories about the masses suffering and/or dying because all is fair in money and profits...
Depends on what your definition of is is? Because I think the fines "is" working just fine. Gov't gets their cut. Big business continues. 
No proof? You have a decent case.

1. You were a runner
2. Took drug
3. Experienced known side effect shortly after
4. Now with regular tendon injuries during normal running.

That's pretty good for a civil case. Preponderance of the evidence is enough.
It looks like these are the risk factors that make it more likely: "FQs should be used cautiously in patients with risk factors associated with tendinitis, such as advanced age, history of tendon rupture, corticosteroid use, and/or acute or chronic renal dysfunction."
source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921747/
>  Didn't get any warning about side effects except

Not even in that booklet with small print that comes with all prescriptions?

Generally a doctor isn't going to spout off the list of possible side effects unless he thinks some of them are likely, or specifically relevant to you given your personal medical situation (or, far less likely, he's being lazy). There's nothing wrong with that. If you want to know that stuff *before* the prescription is filled, ask your doctor while you're in his office.
If you have a while left on it, it would be reasonable to ask your prescriber if it can be changed to something else.
You couldn't find a more serious sounding site than seattle organic restaurants about a Harvard article? 
OP I think you are getting a little intense here. This class of drugs is usually used for pretty serious infections like pneumonia or when other antibiotics have failed/the patient has an allergy to first/second line antibiotics. Also the risk of tendonitis/tendon rupture is: "The prevalence of ATR has been reported in a number of studies with a range of 6 to 37/100,000 persons and increases with age." Which is a range of 0.00006 to 0.00037%.

Also it sucks that you have damge from it. I know that when I have taken Avalox (another fluoroquinolone) I try to avoid over exercising my achilles tendons even though 90% of tendon issues with FQs happened when patients were taking Cipro, not Levaquin.

Well shit. This wasn't a good thread to read this morning. :(

My mom's been on it for months, and will continue to be on it for months to come. 
I agree education is best. 
"Toxins?" Can you be a bit more specific? Your argument sounds ridiculous. 
What does that have to do with bacterial infections? Humans 10,000 years ago lived 30/40 years and died by the thousands and millions (bubonic plague??) to now preventable infections that are treated with "toxins" like Levaquin. 

Why is cancer more common? Well one reason is simply we are living longer, age is the greatest contributor to cancer and the longer you live the greater the likelihood. Most are attributed to this but some others are indeed attributed to environmental factors (alcohol consumption, red meat consumption, smoking, obesity etc). And in large part survivals rates for cancer have dramatically increased over the previous decades.

But you're right cancer is a huge killer now largely because thanks to advances in medicine we have eliminated others. Also importantly our understanding of diseases has dramatically increased. A thousand years ago they probably had no understand of what cancers were let alone how to identify it.
You should do the opposite of what dangersmokeman posted. He's a big marijuana advocate, and is extremely paranoid. He thinks cancer is only 100 years old. Just remember kids, Steve Jobs became his own doctor. 
What always scares me is the commercials on T.V for the prescriptions.

You should not use *Dephadril* while using motor equipment. Possible side affects include,

- Head aches 

- Stomach aches

- Bloody stools

- Convultions

- Death

- Heart attacks

- Death

Try *Dephadril* Today!
Can you tolerate cephalosporins like cephalexin? Levaquin and penicillins don't always cover the same bugs.
As someone without that, I'd rather you just get sepsis and not worry about it.
So sorry . Hugs.
Would you rather have people that work in the FDA with no knowledge of regulations? 
The alternative is that you get people who don't know anything about Pharma regulating them. That is probably not better.
I don't assume guilt. I want everyone to have a fair trial. 

But if your greed leads to bad science that hurts people, there should be consequences. Cutting slightly into profits isn't a sufficient consequence to prevent it from happening again and again. 
charge them as if they were poor...
The fact remains it IS HIS FUCKING FAULT for taking the drug... no lawsuit needed.
No, that wouldn't be reasonable. Unless there is a (major) adverse effect, you should never discontinue a course of antibiotics after they've been started. 
Do you think we take organic dining lightly in Seattle?
Thats why i took it too in the first place i thought the chance is so small. Further did the physician whom i talked to already have issues after taking it and said its not serious. Now i wonder about a 1:10.000 x 1:10.000  = 1:100.000.000 chance to meet s.o. with such problems. In my csse the prostatitis was not life threatening, so i would have avoided the pills if i knew the sideeffects
Yeah, the kind you get in medical school.  Not this shit. 
Cancer becoming an issue actually is less than 100 years old. The rates have been sky rocketing in recent years and you're telling me it's not a major issue? How many people do you know have gotten cancer/died of cancer? For me it's a handful. Go in your bathroom and look at your soap; if you know what most of the ingredients are then you're fine but I guarantee you most of them are lab-synthesized chemicals. To name a few harmful, common everyday household ingredients of the top of my head, Cocomide DEA (most soaps/shampoos, known carcinogen), Sodium Benzoate (common preservative in foods, known carcinogen), Fragrance (parfum)(also known carcinogen in almost every soap/shampoo), any artificial dyes (known carcinogen, known to cause premature hair loss), etc. I could go on and these things are all relatively new to this Earth. Your brand new memory foam mattress, new pillow, new blanket, virtually anything fabric? That's covered in anti-flammable chemicals because a law was passed in the 70s when it was more common to smoke cigarettes and fall asleep with a lit cigarette, causing a fire. But studies show that these chemicals don't actually help much in an actual fire, and they are not only a known carcinogen but also disrupt human sleeping patterns.  If you have cancer, I don't recommend you becoming your own doctor; of course you should go to a fucking doctor. But the time to fix the roof is not when a storm cloud looms overhead but when the sun is shining bright, understand what I mean friend? And btw didn't mean to be derogatory or anything, just I had to respond because I do a lot of research online and I don't appreciate being called stupid or looked down up for my marijuana use, just as someone wouldn't want to be looked down upon for drinking alcohol.
This is because the FDA requires equal amounts of adverse event information presented for the time they spend talking about the efficacy of the drug. If they had one death in a clinical trial of 5,000 patients that was somehow attributed to the drug they likely will have to mention it. 
[deleted]
Pcn and cephalosporins have a very high cross reactivity rate. Both are beta lactam abx
That's not necessarily the alternative. You're making a false dichotomy
What would be ideal is if we didn't persecute people on a "benefit of hindsight" standard of scientific evidence. 
Who? The current CEO? The former CEO? People at the FDA? The office drones? Anyone with a healthcare license who ever worked with the drug? There's a full spectrum of different people with different responsibilities at different times.
Or his doctor should have realized: "Hey, 90% of tendon reactions happen with specifically Cipro out of the whole FQ class. Maybe we should use a different one since the patient is a runner."

Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921747/
It's done under the guidance of healthcare providers all the time. I don't know their situation, so I don't know if it's being prescribed empirically or based on culture and sensitivities. Either way there is bound to be an alternative, it just may not be preferable which is why I suggested they contact their prescriber. 
No, but organic foods are just tenuously related to pharmaceuticals. 
Haven't there been studies to prove he organic food industry is fraudulent?
I wonder if you'd still think that when you see how many doctors get sued for malpractice.
I'm not going to play devil's advocate with you on this one. Since you took a big time out and made this post - I won't argue with you. Alot of what you said I agree with. So this post will be much of me agreeing with you.

I'm big on anti-gmo, and very much against gluten. Wife has celiac. Gluten intolerance didn't even exist until the turn of the century. Grains are not natural. Red40 causes my kids ADHD to spike like crazy.

FDA is basically a legal drug dealer. Corporations can market oxycontin. Doctors become legal drug dealers. Puts the cartel on notice.

I do my due diligence whenever and wherever I can. You mentioned Sodium Benzoate. I won't eat foods that have been treated with nitrites. Finally, they started producing bacon without nitrites (preservative). I think they preserve it with celery seed or something. Could be completely wrong.

My long term life style diet is one that avoids all sugars. I haven't had more than a tablespoon of sugar in the past 4 years. Everything I eat is without sugar, with Stevia, Eryritol, Xylitol.

I think some of the artificial sweetener hoopla is overblown. Personally, I won't drink anything aspartame flavored not because I'm afraid it will give cancer - but just because its god awful. Sucralose is one of the few artificial sweeteners I will ingest. You know what, when you have an entire super market where you have to chose between processed foods with added sugar, or a zero calorie sucralose flavored club soda - give me the a. sweetener. Gotta pick some vices or else you'll just live in a world where everything you touch you're washing your hands. You begin to live in fear.

I'm 28 now. When I was 6 yrs old, my parents and no one around me knew just how bad soda was. I drank easily 12 cans of 12oz sodas a day. Every day. It wasn't until I was around 20 I stopped the non sense. Still, everyone in awhile you gotta have a Coke Zero.

I noticed a direct correlation between my depression/ability to think with my sugar intake during my mid 20s. Sugar is very much a drug. I think in mice labs, you give cocaine laced water, and sugar water and they go for sugar water everytime.

Some things I have to take - which are out of my control. I have a chemical imbalance so I have to take Zoloft. My life is unmanageable otherwise. Source : 24 years of my life not working for me is enough to secumb to some drugs on the market. Yes I understand were still not exactly sure how anti depressants really work. Sort of like acetaminophen. It just works, but no one can really explain how or why. Shit, we just discovered last week acetaminophen dulls the senses/empathy. It's been on the market for what 80 years?

Anyways. The reason I made my original post - was sort of a stupid reason. I got caught up in the reddit circle jerking. I was making fun of you, when I shouldnt have because we both share the same things. 

Cheers, and sorry.


A good example of this is how influenza will be listed as a side effect of many drugs that had long clinical trials that went through a flu season
>This is because the FDA requires equal amounts of adverse event information presented for the time they spend talking about the efficacy of the drug.

It also has something to do with the drug actually having those adverse side effects.
You do realize we are like the only country in the world that allows pharmaceutical companies to advertise prescription drugs on TV right? 

Most countries see how ignorant and corrupt it is, but not us here in the good ole US!
I never worry about that, I can use a kitchen. Which is funny because millions of people use their own kitchens to feed themselves and others. But if I want to sell food prepared in my kitchen I suddenly need a health inspection. Meanwhile the overpriced restaurant has rats and roaches in the kitchen while they serve $20 alphabet soup.
I think it's like 5%
Ok, what's the other option? I was simplifying, but people in that field can get hired by pharma for more money than the government pays. We have the same problem in banking. 
I agree, and I'm not speaking to the merits of this particular suit. 

But consider that it took 12 years on the market to put a warning on the package--and they wouldn't so much as send a letter to doctors informing them of the known risks. They continue to market the drug as safe and effective against common, uncomplicated infections. 

Consider also how long the tobacco industry hid scientific evidence. These were decisions made by citizens that resulted in other citizens' deaths, with the punishment of fines. 

I believe that knowingly withholding or suppressing knowledge about your product that leads directly to unsuspecting users of your product being injured or killed, should result in sufficient consequences. 
Very few doctors are sued for malpractice, actually -- certainly at rates far below actual malpractice.   (Doctors have been very successful in reducing incentives to sue.)   Of course, malpractice is determined by whether the doctor adhered to the standard of care -- ie, did what they teach doctors to do in med school.

For example, suggesting that people "become their own doctor" and live in fear of "toxins" and other hippydippy shit would be malpractice.   
As a non-American I find it funny that they say "Ask your doctor about..."

I figure I'll just let my doctor figure what's best for my current situation. Though I know drug companies also go directly to doctors to have them prescribe more of a given drug, which is incredibly alarming.
[deleted]
In the real world, doctors at pharma companies never "knowingly withhold or suppress" knowledge about their drugs.  Their drug safety monitoring is overseen by tons of outside medical doctors at university hospitals.   Information included on labels tend to be highly cautious and over-inclusive.  (To the extent that it undermines the value of the label, to be honest.)   In the very worst cases, the evidence is that the pharma docs interpreted evidence that was invariably highly inconclusive and ambiguous in a biased manner.   There's nothing criminal about having biased judgment -- it's literally unavoidable.  And our regulatory regime *requires* pharma companies to make judgments themselves rather than dumping it on the regulator.    

Your own view of the evidence is fairly biased.  For example, you describe doctors as suppressing information of "known risks."  Was it a known risk?  Or was it, "we saw this happen to one patient in a study, we don't actually know what the causal mechanism could be, and the study was underpowered to actually detect whether this was associated with the drug or totally random."   When you send a letter to a doctor about every conceivable risk based on every adverse event in a study, you may be covering your ass, but you're ensuring that doctors disregard 100% of your letters as just noise.  

 
What is hippy dippy shit? Anything that's not western medicine? The "western" method of medicine is seen as quackery in large parts of Asia.
[deleted]
Who cares, they shouldn't be able to advertise prescription drugs on TV in the first place. Do you not see what is wrong with that?
Yeah.  Those people also view eating endangered species as enhancing sexual virility and think cold water is unhealthy.  

I'll stick with an evidence-based approach to medicine. 
If you go frequently and your file is up to date your doctor is in a better position to know what you need. Even if your file isn't up to date though odds are he'll know more about your health than you do after a check up.
[deleted]
Who says they don't use evidence? We seem to think that making designer drugs with horrible side effects make people healthy, so we're not too far from bunk science driving our drug manufacturing. Add FDA allowing drugs to be fast tracked without any real long term research.

I don't think you know the history of how our "western" model for medicine came to be.
[deleted]
I agree with you on that. Any possible side effect no matter how rare they need to list or risk being sued like crazy. 
You hope they're low for the average person, but do you know for sure?  How do you know for sure? 
I'm pretty sure the western model *wasn't* "it looks like a penis, so if you eat it, it will make you virile."  But you know, if you want fool around with bullshit like Steve Jobs, be my guest.  
True, the US is behind on their healthcare system.

Always felt the science on talc causing these women’s cancer was weak at best
tl;dr stop putting powder of any kind on/in your genitals.
I agree, but the science has nothing to do with this decision.
The article states it was a technicality due to the jurisdiction in which the lawsuits were filed.
I had talc pleurodesis surgery while traveling abroad where they spray it on your lungs to make them bleed and fuse to the cavity they're in. 

When I got back to the states they said they don't use talc anymore and instead have a brillo pad type scrubber they scratch the lung up with. So I was kinda worried. 
It's the asbestos in the talc. They occur in the ground in the same areas, J&J had shitty quality control.
Never said it did was just commenting the fact there is very little proof that talc was the cause of the cancer

I am sad she got cancer but her case was basically I used it for 35 years and then I got cancer.   What else has she been doing for the last 35 years

Ultimately the consumer in general pays for these lawsuits
The irritant powder is put on the outside of your lungs to prevent recurrent pneumothorax. You should be okay because the talc powder is indicated in causing cancer when it’s inhaled. It likely won’t cause problems outside your lungs. 
There's zero evidence to back that claim.
[deleted]
Getting real fkin' sick of everyone just claiming "fake news" on anything they don't instinctualy agree with rather than doing any research whatsoever.

Care to provide a link that talks about asbestos every being *actually found* in Johnson & Johnson talc?

There's nothing but unsubstantiated conjecture here. 
Well shit, I've been powdering up my balls for a month or two now. Any other recommendations for sweating?

Edit: Equate Pure Cornstarch is what I've been using. I think I survived this time
“You don’t win with jurors on science. They don’t understand science, statistics, the design of studies,” says Erik Gordon, a professor at the School of Business and School of Law at the University of Michigan. “They do understand there was some evidence of a connection between talc and cancer, and J&J didn’t tell customers about it.”  


This statement here makes me sad and just enforces the need for better awareness and education on how scientific evidence can be used to prove or disprove causation. essentially a company can never use proven science to defend itself against a case driven by loose statistics and emotional testimony. 
For an anti chaffing alternative to talc based products try BodyGlide Balm.  https://www.bodyglide.com/


Their body cream contains talc, their balm products do not. 
I thought it was common knowledge not to use talc based products near your lady bits. My gyno warned me away from it almost ten years ago.

Looking forward to the cornstarch lawsuits in 10 years.
This information has been around for years. I was under the impression the formula for baby powder was changed years ago as a result. I used cornstarch (occasionally) with my baby, but never directly on the vagina because it was known (20 years ago) that it was unsafe to do so. Pediatricians (and gynecologists) have been advising against this practice for at least 2 decades. It's unfortunate that these women were so ill-informed and perhaps failed by their healthcare providers. Though I know for some, especially in the US, regular medical care is a luxury they can't afford, so there's that as well. 
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
So that's why my dick is so small. I'm suing. 
They know... Have you seen a baby powder commercial in the past 20 years? 
How can someone be so stupid to think that by hiding this problem, they would somehow get away with something?


I mean if they found out about it, realized it, pulled the product and notified the public to throw it away and reimburse them, they would would probably walk away clean legally.


How fucking hard is it to just do the right thing?
In a way I'm glad I helped contribute to the fight. Studies have proven repeatedly over the last two decades that applying talc near your rectum/ vag results in almost 2X increase cancer risk for ovarian cancer. I just provided that proof to reddit this month even.
WELP. I remember powdering my balls this morning.
I wonder how bad it is to inhale the stuff... I work in the oilfield and we use it for gauging/strapping tanks and wells.... Its windy some days and so on.
If I get testicular cancer am I eligible to sue? 
"No more tears"... because you'll be dead
Is foot powder safe?
Ya we exposed thousands of babies to a life threatening disease, but did you see how much money we made? Yay Corporations
Meh, no proper LAB studies = no real link. 
You have a punctuation problem.
It is deplorable the shit big companies get away with. 
What a long article. Basically studies have shown both that it has a correlation and some that showed that there is no correlation.

My question is: how does the powder get inside of your body unless you stuff it in there?
What is baby powder?

i've never heard of the stuff

and i have a kid
I powder my balls daily (Florida heat + swamp ass = no fun). I switched to a corn starch based baby powder. Works just as well and no talc concerns.
Yeast likes to eat corn starch.   Just saying.
It supposedly only causes ovarian cancer, so dem nuts should be good homie.

It's funny, i was just talking to my gf about this the other day. She told me baby powder caused cancer in women and that you shouldn't give3 it to babies. I'm like, "WTF?! Then why do they get to call it baby powder if it's unsafe for at least 50% of babies." And sure enough theres already a law suit on it. 
Gold bond has a talc-free version. I've been puttin GB on the boys for years, but I guess I gotta switch over too.
Gold Bond powder spray, or "Anti Monkey Butt" powder. 
Try Ajax.
My husband swears by Gold Bond (yellow container)
Pretty sure you're not going to get ovarian cancer.
Dude...try Gold Bond foot-powder. It feels like a thousand breezes on your balls. 
I've taken stats courses in college and pharmacy school and both times my classmates have been really bored. To accomplish what you point out, I believe you need to require philosophy courses at the high school level. But parents would have to be willing to have their kids exposed to Darwin and Nietzsche.

Common knowledge?  -OR-  Learned it from a doctor?
I'm not up corporate's ass here, but the evidence seems to suggest that there is a very weak but noticeable link between talcum powder, and cancer.
Interesting link, thanks.
Calm down you baby faced monster

Take that case to small claims court. 
That probably has more to do with the ubiquity of the product, rather then them "knowing" something.  When's the last time you saw a commercial for Kleenex?
Not since there was all the hubbub in the 90's about talcum powder causing cancer...

I always wondered why it never disappeared after all the publicity it got.

Wow. Hadn't really noticed that until now. Is it really that hard to make a formula for children that's safe & nutritious?
>How fucking hard is it to just do the right thing?

For Johnson and Johnson? Pretty hard.  


>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched multiple investigations into Johnson & Johnson related to its promotion of certain drugs and dangerous products. In some cases, the FDA mandated recalls.
 > In 2012, the FDA censured J&J in a historic marketing case involving claimants from 36 states. By improperly marketing antipsychotic drugs for six years, J&J put patients in danger and violated consumer protection laws.

> In February 2015, a jury awarded the family of a boy who took Risperdal and developed 46DD breasts $2.5 million in the first lawsuit to face a jury. Evidence produced during the trial revealed J&J knew of the high risk of gynecomastia and marketed it to doctors as safe for children long before receiving FDA approval.
... And a human being. 
I'd advise bringing face masks for now on.
No kidding.

The talc=cancer people sound a lot like the homeopathic and vaccines cause autism communities: No science; just the feels.
Are you familiar with the female anatomy? I'm guessig if you use this between your legs, it kicks up dust and is absorbed through mucus membranes. 

I use cornstarch sometimes for long days working outside, and it's impossible to completely keep out of your vagina. 

They said straight up that studies that observe duration and frequency of use found the correlation, studies that looked at either but not both did not show correlation.

Here is a good example on how talc gets up there: sex. You talked up that day or she did and bam, you now have some particles deep in the canal.
Chemicals get absorbed into your body through your skin.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(skin)
It's when you turn your unwanted baby into a powder. You still have your baby, that's why you never heard of it.
I don't know if people still use it this way, but most people use it during diaper changes or when the baby has diaper rash. After you change the diaper and get the baby all clean, you sprinkle on a bit of the baby powder on the baby's butt crack and it helps stop the rash and helps prevent diaper rash from forming. Most brands use only cornstarch in their baby powder and baby powder can also double as a dry shampoo.
Talc, Talcum - a white powder that's really light and fluffy, and absorbs moisture.

It's also used a moisture absorber in foodstuffs - it's often used with rice, for example.
Plus, free pancakes!
Use talc once a week for a gliding layer of talc on your skin
Beware: Corn starch can cause bacterial growth if you don't bath often
I would trade a shorter over all life without swamp ass/monkey butt for a longer life with constant chafing.

Powder is a necessity for this overweight middle-aged guy......
Well, I breathe the shit. Smacking them nuts around with a handful of powder does tend to cause a lot of dust
I use Francis on deez nuts.
so is footpowder safe?
I don't think a whole course in each science or statistics is needed.  Just some simple education about how each is applied. A statistician can take any data they want see a correlation in trend and try to apply it.  

Statistics are used in scientific pursuits as well but are meaningless unless a direct mechanism or cause for the correlation is also identified. This is what people need to understand about the way the studies are done. 
There are many studies done by universities and outside agencies too.  in many cases a probable causal link has to be suspects not just some weak statistical correlation from a tiny population, but outside studies are done when needed. 


Both. I asked a few friends today at work and they all knew not to use it down there. I also looked at a bottle of Shower to Shower bath powder and noticed it had talc and no warning, as well. I wonder if they'll start feeling the heat.
Tote steel like bronson, vigilante you wanna get off son you need to ask me
Don't belittle the man like that
All the time. Kleenex brand and other tissue makers still advertise on TV 
Also, most baby powder is corn starch these days, not talc.  The corn starch formula still contains the warning not to use too much near baby's face.

They know.  Yes they do.
In the colder months I see Kleenex commercials. Like the one, "send a box" to a loved one. Or how they advertise those with lotion or Vicks in the tissue.
Kleenex causes cancer?! It's the kleenex dust, huh?
Every winter.
Why does coca cola still advertise then?
How long did it take you to post that from 1994?
This story is about powder, not baby formula. 
Nutritional science changes with the winds. What we have for baby forumla now leads to developmental issues because they are avoiding putting in the same levels of cholesterol and fats as breast milk.
lol.. on a serious note, think about all of the baby girls that still use talc based baby powder to this day, several times a day, they get a highest risk of DNA mutation. There's people that even have an addiction to eating the shit.
The concern seems justified (the link to ovarian cancer). Like asbestos it is just ground up rock and the tiny little sharp particulates that you can't see are the problem. 

Then again I think the fear of asbestos is justified, but the panic may be a bit exaggerated to hype up lawsuits. 
No, it's NOT the same, and epidemiology IS science. There is a quantifiable, statistically increased rate of ovarian cancer in talc users compared to talc non-users. The same cannot be said of autism in vaccinated vs non-vaccinated. It is difficult to establish causality because it would be unethical to knowingly expose people to a suspected carcinogen in a controlled study. That does NOT mean the correlation does not exist, and it does NOT mean that science says there is NO connection, causal or otherwise. It may just be a different pathway, for example, women with smelly vaginas are more likely to use talc, and smelly vaginas are an early symptom of cellular changes associated with cancer. After all, the article starts out noting the dog smelled a problem.
[removed]
So would this have the same effect if a guy used it ?

But the claim is that the cancer is formed around talk particles. Which means they somehow have to go further up there to actually reach the place where the ovarian cancer starts. I can see it entering but I have a hard time believing it travels further all by itself.
Kinda like making whale oil from whales?
For males people apply it to their scrotum to prevent stickage.  It's an absolute must in the summer.
Garlic parmesean pancakes :(
Talc is exactly where the asbestos came from in Baby Powder.
That's funny I would look at it as losing weight being the necessity. Attack the cause not the symptom especially when the treatment causes cancer.
Switch to cornstarch 
Buy a bidet. It'll at least take care of your butt issues.
ahh yeah. I think the problem with that is talc that isn't totally pure may contain asbestos, which would in fact cause a problem for you if you're breathing it in
A good wash down with rubbing alcohol on a folded paper towel also works wonders.
Try using the spray, Gold bond spray is legit. 
Eh, probably not, but what is these days..
[deleted]
Don't get short with him. The skinny is that he has a case.
You completely failed to get the point of my comment.  The point was the ubiquitous products aren't marketed, or at least not very aggressively. /u/botheyes was implying by his post that J&J was covering up something because they haven't run a baby power commercial in the past 20 years.  I'm saying that isn't the reason.
[deleted]
OK technically it was more than 20 years old. But I just figured 3 links are better than 2.
Actually think of it this way, our bodies are complex chemical machines that respond to environmental pressures through epigenetic changes.  That the population changes its genetic makeup is outside of this consideration.  So what we choose from generation to generation constantly remixes what is expected.
>Then again I think the fear of asbestos is justified

Most asbestos studies I've ever read uses concentrations talc users (IMO) would never be exposed to in their entire life. Is there some new research you base your concern on, or is it just based on feelings and the over hyped fear that was generated from asbestos insulation?
I am, i just hadn't read the article. 
If you're straight and sexually active, I'd worry about affecting your partner. Don't let these other people shit on you, it's a valid question.
Well, it's linked to ovarian cancer so my guess is no. 
> I can see it entering but I have a hard time believing it travels further all by itself.

Fortunately for you, this aspect didn't escape those smart scientists who performed studies!  Wouldn't it be funny though, if some layperson like you thought of some really SUPER obvious problem that magically no one else had thought of?  Hey, you're the expert skeptic here, *does* talc get way up into the ovaries?

Luckily, science has our answer - they don't exactly know *how* it happens, but they have clear evidence that it *does* happen.

> Talc is able to migrate through the genital tract and gain access to the ovaries because talc fibers have been detected in benign and malignant ovarian tissue (22), 

http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/3/249.full

This study, by the way...

> did not observe an overall association between epithelial ovarian cancer and ever use of talc, and there was no apparent dose response, although we lacked information on duration of talc use. In analyses stratified by histologic subtype, we observed a modest positive association between invasive serous cancer and ever talc use.


First comes the baby bowder, then comes sex or tampon, then comes cancer. 
Maybe this is just me, but it should be legal for guys to freeball during the summer instead of having to put powder all over themselves. I use it under my boobs during the summer and it seems silly to put powder on when I could be topless. But I'm just sayin'.
With a salt and vinegar kick!
There's some irony in suggesting a switch to a food based powder. 
 You've clearly never been to a swamp. All of Florida is like swimming through the air. 
Nah bro no time for that shit, and biggies the man sorry
I....don't think they were serious.
Username checks out.
How come people use "how come" awkwardly instead of using "why?"
Breast milk is a constant. Deviations from it cause issues. They've documented this time and again. But mainstream formula is not aligned with breast milk's composition. And so, you get problems.
> If you're straight and sexually active

I'm a guy who powders daily, I never thought about the risk to my wife via intercourse.


Lol thanks buddy. I use it whenever I jump out of the shower, so thought I'd inquire.
Interesting, so we really have no idea how it moves up there.
So they do stuff it in there ;p

But on a serious note, so far the studies haven't shown that talk causes cancer just that when there is talk, the cancer prefers to latch onto it. I know we love to think that big companies are evil but from the conflicting studies I give them the benefit of the doubt.
I agree 100%.


Unfortunately in 2016 it is only appropriate to be naked when you sleep at night.
Grew up in Georgia, later moved to Hawaii. The bidet definitely works.

why come you got no tattoo?
Your statement is more or less correct except for, oh wait no, a mother's diet largely affects breastmilk production.  Please refrain from making specious claims that equate to natural good, artificial bad.
1) Use talc in the AM.  Have sex in the PM.  Talc is forcibly pushed into vagina.

2) Use talc.  Follow with insertion of tampon.
It's spelled "talc" not "talk".  Either way, if I own a company and find out that using my products is a statistically significant contributor to cancer, I believe I would be morally wrong to withhold that information from the public.  Let the people decide for themselves if the risk is worth the reward, as with cigarettes, mcdonalds, and tanning booths.  It shouldn't matter the mechanism by which it contributes to cancer, it matters that they weren't honest.  They displayed disregard for public health because it would impact their bottom line.  
Miners who  extracted talc also had much higher rates of cancer in the 1970's http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/talc.html 
After the fact. What they are talking about is containing the swamp ass while your away from your bidet. Unless you carry a portal bidet with you and spray your ass down once every 15 minutes. 
Tattoo makes you come?  Why?
Assuming access to nutrients and some common sense from the mother, there is no comparison of natural vs. artificial.

If you could provide an article or something to substantiate that - doesn't have to be a study - I'd be happy to take a look at it.

No need to get angry over spilled (breast) milk.
Aren't any type of miner more likely to have lung cancer?
Yes, but  take something like coal,  other miners don't typically mine coal   and sell to companies who put it in plastic  bottles and tell people it's safe to put on their genitals 
This used to be a conspiracy theory.
>Johnson & Johnson faces several hundred lawsuits claiming that it, in an effort to boost sales, failed for decades to warn consumers that its talc-based products could cause cancer.

Not the first nor will it be the last company to sell you tainted products for the almighty dollar. 
What about Gold Bond? I use copious amounts of that stuff on my nuggets during the summer months to prevent bat wings. Is I 'gon get the ball cancer? Will I get paid?? 
As a physician, albeit not an oncologist or gynecologist - what? The talc with asbestos might be a cancer risk, but the regular stuff isn't thought to be a cancer risk, and if it is, it's a very weak risk factor. It seems weird to punish a company for hiding information that is not true. Also, ovarian cancer is multi-factorial, caused by some combination of genetics, obesity, number of children, birth control (reduces your risk), and undetermined environmental factors. If this woman was obese, didn't use birth control, and was from a family where lots of women have ovarian cancer, it seems silly to punish the company for this.
[deleted]
I thought talc was just bad for allergies. I had no idea it posed a cancer risk. Turns out it can contain asbestos.

The first time I'm thankful for sensitive skin. 
A lit of Chinese talc has asbestos in it. Its been known for a long time.
what is the actual science to back this up?
This is like the anti-vaxer case that won, this case won because the studies themselves are faulty. Do the research guys, there have been NO long term studies involving talc based baby powder and there have been multiple studies that coincidentally showed a twofold increase to almost twofold increase of ovarian cancer when the powder was regularly placed near the vagina/ perineum, not other areas.

You guys shouldn't be mad at the people suing, be mad at our government for refusing to complete long term studies when new products are put on the market. This case could have been prevented if the proper studies were conducted since the late 1970's.
That's some real questionable science. Any proposed mechanism? 

Just smells like BS to me.
Wow. Never read the fine print on a bottle of talc.  May cause cancer and / or breathing problems.

This legitimately might have been my boss from last summer. Great guy that had lost his wife a few years ago from ovarian cancer due to her using talc powder every day for years and years. He was involved in some legal stuff but said he really wasn't in it for the money, he just wanted people to become aware. 

EDIT: nvm, but same city, same story. Maybe he'll end up getting something in a suit too though

no human life is worth 72 million.  An absurd amount of money for this shit.  
I'm pretty sure it still is and this jury is just a bunch of morons. No way this doesn't get appealed to someone with some sense. Even if it isn't I can't imagine a $72 million dollar award not getting knocked down to a much smaller amount. I'd expect about a million follow-up lawsuits to be filed tomorrow though. I'd be selling any stock in any company making baby powder ASAP.
Funny... This product is used frequently on taints.
This was because some talc products contained traces of actinolite and tremolite, asbestos type minerals. Asbestos contaminated Talc was removed from skin care products in the 1970s in the US, though in the late 90s here in Ireland an undergraduate geology student in my geology department discovered traces of actinolite and tremolite contamination in some talc products. I think all talc has been removed from skin care products in Europe out of caution.

However, asbestos doesn't cause ovarian cancer,  it causes mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer. So I'm confused why there was a payout here. 

http://m.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/talcum-powder-and-cancer

Edit: As someone else pointed out, this woman might have had mesothelioma in her lungs that spread to her ovaries, that the article didn't properly explain her illness.
[removed]
Ovarian cancer. So wash your junk before sex, otherwise "cancer stick" doesn't just refer to cigarettes anymore.
Shaquille O'Neil would nicer mislead you 
RN here, doc. Metastatic mesothelioma? Just spitballing, many people confuse mets with primary diagnosis in my experience. I'm sure the media is no exception. If it's in the ovary, they'll call it ovarian because they don't know any better. 
I mean surely the only possible explanation is that the company knew they were using asbestos contaminated talc and that is what this case is based on.

If it isn't then there really isn't a case because there is 0 scientific evidence of Talc causing cancer and therefore it is in no way the companies fault that one lady happened to get cancer.

Jurys are stupid sometimes though and then add on the fact that the public are irrationally scared of anything "chemical" then it's possible I suppose.
She did use it multiple times a day for 35 years.  That's got to be atypical use.
Great to hear the opinion of somebody that was on the jury and heard all the evidence!
Is there actual research here that I'm not aware of? Is the johnsons baby powder I'm putting on my grundle going to kill me?
[removed]
[deleted]
There have been a couple dozen studies about it, and there does appear to be a statistically weak connection between using talcum powder and developing ovarian cancer. The problem is the sample sizes on the studies has simply been too small to draw clear conclusions, and the studies haven't always done a good job controlling for other variables.

Talcum powder is chemically similar to asbestos (and indeed, prior to 1976, lots of talcum powder *contained* asbestos), so a link wouldn't be surprising. It hasn't been "proven" scientifically though, especially with modern talc. [This is a good study to read as a starting point](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/3/249.full).
You've been up and down this post asserting that consumer grade Talc is a carcinogen. Where are you getting this information that contradicts thirty years of scientific research by independent companies around the world?
Where does it say that it contains formaldehyde? This article says that there is a compound that can produce formaldehyde, which can be said about the same chemical process in our bodies. 
And what is the rest of this list which goes on and on? I'd like to know. 
>But never fear JNJ is safe from ALL prosecution. 

The court case about the baby powder indicates J&J is not safe from ALL prosecution.
They are one of the biggest health care and pharmaceuticals companies out there.
Well, if someone could prove they wanted to create future cancer patients to eventually market their drugs to... I'm sure they wouldn't be the last.

Companies try to build trust and brand loyalty by setting up an altruistic facade, but what they really want is your money. Nobody cares, nobody wants to step on their bosses toes, nobody wants to lose their bonus or their career. Products are already in the pipeline, marketing has already been pushing the product. Who wants to be the one to pull the plug or admit liability?

I guess one truly positive thing about the Internet is that if enough people get angry about an issue and say something, it can become an embarrassment that shareholders can't ignore. Sad. That's what all of this is. 
I use it under my breasts to help keep it dry, especially during the summer months. There are other women who do the same thing for the same reason. 
It's mostly punitive damages, so not actually meant to compensate for the damage, but to deter them from continuing the damaging practice.  
Most baby powder is made from corn starch AFAIK
If the talc contains some type of asbestos related mineral you most definitely will not see that figure come down.

But you are right about share prices. Actually I would wait and then buy J&J once everyone dumps at a super low price just before they go into bankruptcy to organize a trust administration for talc powder exposure. W.R. Grace did the same thing and when it went bankrupt prices were cheap and when it came out (after 11 years) the stock price had booked considerably.

I'm not sure how long J&Js bankruptcy will last or if you would even consider having assets illiquid for 11 years, but the payout might be good. J&J are still a staple of their respective industry.
yep, cosmetic talc powder is about as pure as it can possibly get. The science around this is bs. Plaintiffs' attorneys are looking for a test case so they can force companies to settle at the outset rather than risk a jury verdict like this 
> I'd be selling any stock in any company making baby powder ASAP

Funny enough, [J&J stock has only gone up since the talc decision](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=JNJ+Interactive#{"range":"5d","allowChartStacking":true})
Wow. Were you on the jury – did you hear the evidence?   
hahaha..Dam I missed that. 
Don't do that. You'll get cancer. 

Edit:  I didn't know they replaced talc with corn starch. I stopped using it 30 years ago because of the talc. 
It sets off my Asthma horribly. Took forever to figure out why I kept having attacks in the morning while doing my make-up. Used it for decades in the hair salon to dust hair off clients necks. Now I can't even walk into a salon. Other chemicals also set off attacks, yet talc seems to hit me the quickest. 
What happens is that the cancer causing minerals, when applied to the genital region (as some women used talc to do), would enter their vaginas and manage to cause the issues that way.  Or, at least, that was how it was roughly explained to me a while back when I first heard about the issue.
what? axing them off??
That's a good thought, especially because peritoneal mesothelioma is a phenomenon linked to asbestos. The sources I've found online do point to work done to find a connection between primary ovarian cancer and talc powder applied to the vagina (idea being the powder travels up through the cervix, uterus, Fallopian tube, to get to the ovary), so the story is probably correct here, but you're right, a lot of people confuse the two. It's always interesting to take a family history and see how many people have relatives who had "breast cancer, and then also bone cancer". Hmm.
This is why companies settle. Anyone can throw an expert witness on the stand that will spin bullshit for whatever ridiculous fee they charge. You never know if the jury's going to fall in love with the plaintiff, want to right great wrongs, assign huge judgements...
[deleted]
I had no idea some talc had asbestos. 
Asbestos is a high aspect ratio fiber that can transmigrate throughout the body. Its a nanomaterial, like carbon nanotubes, with similar (high) toxicity for that reason. 
And watch your cosmetics, ladies.
This is a joke right?  We don't even use baby powder anymore due to the risk of inhalation. 
Also: correlation vs causation.

For example, a study clearly shows that people who live underneath high voltage power lines have higher rates of tooth decay than those who don't. Then again, what kind of homes do you find underneath high voltage power lines? Trailers, and the associated living conditions of those who live in trailers. 
"contradicts thirty years of scientific research"

nope. http://www.drugwatch.com/talcum-powder/
I think he means jail time.
Oh wow I didn't know that was an issue and I have double i breasts. Maybe I got lucky with not sweating much.
It is now, but was talcum powder years ago. As for the switch, fuck me and my corn allergy. This is why I itch like hell when I get a haircut. Barbers tend to dust their brushes with baby powder. I always shower as soon as I get home from a haircut.
The first ingredient is corn starch, the second is talc, they list them on the back. Cheap store brands use just corn starch, that's why they suck.
You think this would bankrupt one of the largest companies in the world? 
I thought soaps and stuff like gold bond still had talc in them.

Edit: Taint cancer is nothing to be laughed at.  Taint funny.
As I recall there's an instructional video 
Yes, or lung/brain. 

That's crazy as shit that talc could make that journey. Asbestos traveling there via capillary action? How much talc would you have to put on your vag and for how long?  Maybe because asbestos is insoluble any amount making its way up there would be a constant tissue irritant. Very strange.
Not in all cases. There's still some out there.
Talc used in consumer products is not harmful  and has decades of scientific evidence to prove it. Corn starch is less effective, and has not been studied as thoroughly. 
Asbestos and talc are both minerals and can be found in the same mines. So when they mine talc, sometimes they could get a vein of asbestos in it. A few decades ago there was the same problem with vermiculite. 
Yeah, TIL.
It switched something like over thirty years ago, so there are at least two generations that didn't know baby powder was talcum powder at one point.
I do too.  To get rid of the little hair pieces everywhere....
Talc is made up of magnesium and silicon. It's not good for you.  Though corn starch brands may "suck" they won't be the reason you are having chemotherapy sessions at 55.
It's not going to bankrupt them like I think you are implying. You should do a little studying and research on bankruptcy law. Companies with products containing asbestos or companies that mined asbestos go into Chapter 11 restructuring to create "victim's trusts" that are billion dollar trusts that they set aside to pay for people who can show they are victims of their product.

Ever see those Mesothelioma commercials on CNN or pretty much anywhere during daytime TV? Asking if you ever worked in shipyards, the oil industry, steel industry, etc. When I was out of college I used to clerk for a firm and file claims against a variety (40+) companies that had declared bankruptcy and were mandated by the government to create victim's trusts for anyone who came into contact with their products as part of their reorganization.

That's why I say you should invest in it before it goes into reorganization, cause a company like W.R. Grace did so and when it came out if you owned any stock in it you saw a hefty prize for your risk. For example if you had bought up W.R. Grace for 142 shares at 7 dollars (1,000 dollars) just before it went into bankruptcy restructering and let it go then today it would be worth 68.79 cents a share x 142 shares = $10,000 give or take. Multiply number of shares accordingly for your desired fortune.
Nope not even once. Can you make it?
Yeah that's probably why, it would be a constant irritant and never really break down. Still, I feel like it would super hard to prove unless they have biopsy specimen that show asbestos bodies... maybe they had that?
I use talc for ant control and foot powder was the last place I found it.
I didn't know it *isn't* talcum powder... TIL, apparently...
> silicone

Silicon. Silicone is a man-made polymer.
Right, but there's been no scientific evidence of the fact Talc causes cancer. Its all hypothesis and speculation at this point. So how on earth a jury has found a company liable for someones cancer when we still today don't have any evidence for it is beyond me.

I shouldn't be surprised though, Ive been on jury duty and I hope I never get accused of a crime because all it takes is a bit of bad luck and a few easily swayed people and you can be convicted easily with minimal evidence. Probably even worse when you're a "big bad company" and you've been using CHEMICALS! 

 Jurys suck IMO.
> Talc is made up of magnesium and silicone. 

> It's not good for you. 

Is the second statement supposed to follow from the first? Every rock contains silicon, it's fantastically mundane. Magnesium, admittedly, is flash powder, and reacts with water in its elemental form, but that's exactly why it is hardly ever *in* its elemental form and is usually found combined firmly with other stuff. There's a lot of it in mineral water, and in people. If you have magnesium deficiency you get fat, get high blood pressure, and have muscle twitches.

It really sounds like you're just saying "ooh, chemicals are in it, can't be good for you, stay away from anything made of chemicals."

Note: asbestos is dangerous because of its microscopic *shape.*
> magnesium and silicone

Are those your reasons for why it's not good for you?  Magnesium is great for humans, and silicone is non-reactive.
Lol what? Its a compound that isnt going to behave how Mg and Si do normally. And iirc those arnt even very damgerous in their elemental form
Oh hell no, I get squeemish just thinking about that shit. It was about all I could do to watch Saw all the way through. 
Yeah, you can get foot powder made from corn starch that doesn't cause cancer and lung problems.
Same here. 
Seriously? Over one letter?
Talc in it's natural form contains plenty of asbestos.  I don't know where you are getting your information but there is plenty of evidence that talc causes cancer.  Talc products since the 1970s no longer contain asbestos luckily but they do still contain talc.
> asbestos is dangerous because of its microscopic shape

Yeah, but also because it's so inert that the rods live in your lungs for 100 years.
You just totally made something up: It really sounds like you're just saying "ooh, chemicals are in it, can't be good for you, stay away from anything made of chemicals."  and then argued against that. So I'll do the same.

It sounds like you are saying "nothing gives you cancer" and you are wrong.
Of course you are correct that compounds don't behave like their elemental components but... http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1063040/Cancer-alert-talc-Women-using-powder-day-risk.html that doesn't mean when put together they are safe either.
Jeez I use baby powder with talc in it to keep my junk dry on hot days... What I'm thinking right now is I should toss that shit out?
For serious.  It's an entirely different thing with the extra letter.
It's a massive difference.
To be fair it was a pretty important letter in that word.
Talc and Asbestos are two completely different things.

Talc is usually found close to Asbestos though and therefore before regulations came in Talc was often contaminated with asbestos.

Talc these days contains no asbestos as the regulations are strict.

Asbestos causes cancer, Talc (as far as we're aware) doesn't.

> there is plenty of evidence that talc causes cancer

Link one scientific article that concludes there is anything more than a small, insignificant correlation between Talc and cancer. I haven't seen one yet.
>Talc in it's natural form contains plenty of asbestos

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talc#Asbestos_link

You're an idiot.


Asbestos doesn't cause ovarian cancer.
Yeah no.  You should go read the actual studies instead of the misleading info that convinced jurors to award 72 million.

Youll notice the focus is on abestos containing talcum powders. Which are stricly regulated now and should contain 0% abestos or they would face pretty harsh consequences if it was contaminated. 

http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0VY02O

Theres been a lot of studies about talc related to the actual miners and its been concluded that abestos-free talc is not cancer causing. 

This lawsuit is very frustrating for me because I feel like a charismatic lawyer just played an uneducated jury. 
Yeah, I'd toss it.  go for some cornstarch based stuff.
I've corrected my spelling mistake you pedant.
Inflammation may be the biological mechanism. I can't link this article because it lives behind a paywall, but this if from the International Journal of Gynecological Cancer, Volume 25 Supplement 1, May 2015, p 51:

> Background and Aims:
> Controversy surrounds the question of whether talc use causes ovarian cancer.

>Design:
>Formal systematic analysis of talc use and ovarian cancer.

>Methods:
>All accumulated epidemiologic evidence (23 case-control studies, 5 meta-analyses, and 3 analyses of a single cohort) and basic science studies were reviewed and graded for quality. Data were considered overall and by histologic subtype. Attributable Risk estimates were calculated. Factors favoring causality were the wellaccepted Hill's criteria.

>Results:
>Talc use increased ovarian cancer risk by 30–60% in almost all well-designed studies. The Attributable Risk was 29%, meaning that elimination of talc use could protect more than one quarter or more of women who develop ovarian cancer. Risk elevations were found consistently among good case-control studies, 2 of 3 cohort analyses, and all meta-analyses/pooled analyses. Well-designed studies that considered dose-response by both duration and frequency all found higher risk among women exposed to more applications. A plausible biologic mechanism is inflammation, known to cause other epithelial cancers. The talc association is more specific to serous ovarian cancer. Systematic bias is excluded because talc use is a durable behavior unlikely to be subject to recall bias; good case-control studies were all population-based or cohorts averting selection bias; and multiple adjustment for other risk factors limited confounding.

>Conclusion:
>Hill's tenets suggest that talc use causes ovarian cancer. Several, but not all, baby powder manufacturers have already replaced talc with corn starch.
It's currently listed as possible and many studies are underway.  You can go ahead and rub it on our balls every night, I'm going to steer clear. http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/ovarian/risks/?region=on

No need to be so rude.  

The reason talc products used to contain a lot of asbestos is because asbestos is present in talc mines.  They are more careful now to keep the asbestos from contaminating the talc and to source talc destined for cosmetic products from different mines.
It sure did up to the 1970s when women were rubbing it on their privates.
The little I've read on this attributes the problems to the talc and not to asbestos contaminated talc.  How old is that study you linked?  That sounds like what they were talking about 15 years ago.
Tossing your junk is fun, cornstarch though... not trying to make a damn roux here.
You're welcome, you ingrate.
I was wondering exactly how it gets from the surface of the skin to irritation of the ovaries, but I'm a bit naive.

[Something from a journal published in 2000](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3703729)

"Perineal talc use"

"via ascension from the lower genital tract"
So there is no evidence at the moment. Keep downvoting me but I'm right.


> It's currently listed as possible

[Ahem. So are many, many things. (This list is not at all concise even.)](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/28/116-things-that-can-give-you-cancer-list)

Basically almost anything could potentially give you cancer, if you pay attention to poor studies.
That's not my point. My point is that Talc has no scientific evidence that it causes cancer.

Now, whether the company knew they were using asbestos contaminated Talc is another point completely.

From where I'm standing that's the only way there could be a case built against them, if they were covering up known cancerous sources.

However, literally everything is linked to cancer these days. You can't go around punishing companies because their products have proposed but not proven links to cancer. 

Processed meat was recently shown to increase cancer risk but you don't see meat producers being sued over every guy that ate meat and got cancer.
Thats how old most of these studies are.
In court they cited a study that showed a correlation between abestos-containing talc powder and ovarian cancer. But future studies suggest that abestos-free talc is safe. 

A good lawyer played on statistics and emotion. Im sure the boy whos mother died helped make the jurors feel sorry for them. And the lady who died for the 72 million award was like 83. At that age its impossible to determine a cause of cancer. The body is just deterioating and has been exposed to so much shit over the years. 


https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,15&q=talc++"ovarian+cancer"&scisbd=1

Feel free to browse those results for more info. Most recent is 2016 and says there is no correlation.

>The American Cancer Society says it is not clear if products containing talcum powder increase cancer risk. 

>In February, a jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $72 million to the family of Jackie Fox. Fox died of ovarian cancer in 2015.

>A jury in St. Louis awarded $55 million in damages to Gloria Ristesund, who used Johnson & Johnson's talcum powder for more than **35 years before** being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2011.


How do look at someones entire life, 35 years of which was using this product, and pinpoint **that** as the cause of cancer?

This is the **dumbest** shit I've ever heard.
is there anything in the modern world that does not cause cancer?
Step 1. Identify common disorder associated with high costs and lots of sympathy. Jury friendly diseases include cancer, birth defects, etc. Best victim classes are children and mothers.

Step 2. Identify deep pocket plaintiff. Either associated with affected people, or associated with so many people that there is bound to be overlap and correlation.

Step 3. Research. Find the studies that hint at *causation*. If there are no studies, then raise the questions and get the studies funded. 

Step 4. Patience. Keep taking cases to trial and some will win. Jury / Jurisdiction shop until you hit the jackpot a couple times. Forget the losses and move on, they are not important. Each win is precedent though and will generate more doubt and more studies. Enough studies and eventually one will proves whatever you want to prove. 

Step 5. Establish a class.

Step 6. (for real) Profit!


Fuck...  I guess we're switching to straight corn starch.
Damn, I enjoy a little talc on my balls every night before I sleep too.

Just sprinkle some talc on him Johnson.
I keep seeing commercials for this when I watch Johnny Carson on antennatv lol
Anyone else find it bizarre they are also trying to cure cancer?  Is this a perpetual profit making scheme?
Hey all, guess what talc is also in...

Most of all tablets. So like 90% of drugs.

It's ok they'll just pep themselves up by squirting shampoo in some kittens eyes.
No, animals were harmed during the testing of this product.....
You tell'em Stock bot.  J&J ain't hurtin.
I work in a related field and can say with some certainty that it **is** dumb.  Part of these verdicts is the geographic location. Notice that the people who are bringing these lawsuits in St. Louis courts aren't from the St. Louis area?  There are a few reasons for this, one of which being availability of punitive damages, and another is the jury pool - which is ideal for plaintiffs who are primarily black women.  

Missouri's standards for which "expert" witnesses are allowed to offer opinions are somewhat more lax than other states, it's more of a "let's just let whoever the hell the lawyer's say is qualified talk and let the jury sort it out" approach. It makes it more difficult to disqualify a witness based on faulty methodology or insufficient expertise. 

So then the jury is presented with two conflicting views from scientists/doctors who testify in these kinds of cases for a living.  St. Louis city juries are usually comprised of primarily minority, mid- to low income people with high school diplomas.  The average juror has little to no basis for understanding most of the science being presented.  At the end of the day it's Big Corporation versus little old lady with cancer who looks like their sister/mother/aunt/grandmother.  In that light, these huge verdicts are not surprising.

The appeals should be interesting, however. 
Well it depends on how much the jury understands correlation and causation. There are benefits of having a jury but there's also downsides
In today's episode of "Correlation Does Not Equal Causation...."
Is it possible that much like the people repeating the oft-referenced McDonalds coffee suit you just don't know that much about the trials?

Or is it more likely you know more than the entirety of the 2 juries you just referenced?
You go to concert
From the Wikipedia entry for talc the connection to ovarian cancer is not clear, but they did state: "A 1971 paper found particles of talc embedded in 75% of the ovarian tumors studied."
You'll probably be fine, this is potentially an issue for women because their genitals are open.

Unless that powder is getting in your urethra you're likely fine.
Sun causes cancer.  Let's blow that bastard out of the sky.
Is there a link to this that I don't have to register to read the entire article? I'll be here eating my BLT in the meantime.
The problem is with the talc going up into their vaginas because they use it on their crotch.
Actually, this product is considered a cosmetic, so it didnt require testing at all. 
I started reading with hope that I could grab some while low...
>At the end of the day it's Big Corporation versus little old lady with cancer who looks like their sister/mother/aunt/grandmother.

Which is why they win...

Just because the jury agrees, doesn't make them right... It's a panel made up of random people from the general public and the general public is full of retards.

Make a jury out of medical professionals and researchers and I may be more inclined to trust their judgement.
I don't know too much about the trial, but the medical research connecting talc to cancer isn't that definitive.

[I think we should set more accomplishable goals first.](https://youtu.be/Csj7vMKy4EI)
Nitrates, a group of compounds that are used in preserving meats and are responsible for maintaining the red color, are a carcinogenic concern when consuming them in large quantities. Bacon and hot dogs were targeted because people generally consume those preserved or smoked meats more than any other, but it's really consumption of nitrates that is particularly risky.

However, nitrates have been used in preserving meats for hundreds of years, so really just like any other cancer scare, it comes down to moderation being key.
yes but eating 3 rashers of bacon for breakfast each morning gives you 100% protection against becoming a suicide bomber

Why though?
unless it was sold in china, then by law its required to be tested on animals.
There's more evidence that burnt toast gives you cancer than there is talcum powder, but am I going to stop eating toast and/or sue the biggest bakery I can find if I get cancer in 35 years? No, probably not...
As much as people love to justify this case, I always feel like I can't suspend my disbelief. It's a higher temperature than what's typical, but wasn't she aware of how hot it was anyway by holding it? Whenever people tell the story I just think 'that's it'? Maybe it's because I live in Asia, in a country where we have way more tolerance for breaching of safety rules and regulations.

Is that what you expect to happen when coffee spills on you?

Aside from that you don't seem to know what happened as "cold" coffee was never received. Still hot enough to burn you, just not hot enough to burn through you.
It rides up :l
The official answer is, a lot.  A lot of force.
I don't think it would crack in the sense that we think it would. We could force it in half and disrupt nuclear fusion, but no cracking because it's not a solid object. Nor it is gaseous or liquid. 
Send a question in to XKCD what-if.  My bet is basically another larger star or time.
Two large enough chunks of magnetized iron on opposite magnetic poles could probably do it. It might immediately come back to together and collapse in on itself, but it would crack it for a bit.

(Iron is the middle ground, below it in atomic number fusion occurs in a star and above it fission occurs, it's like throwing water on a camp fire. Yes water is made when wood is burned, but you don't wanna go putting it all up in there)
[deleted]
I think a huge magnet might do it. Or lots of little magnets, like the ones on my refrigerator.
Nobody will ever win a lawsuit using nitrates as the reason against any hot dog manufacturing company, considering people take in far more nitrates from pollution caused by vehicles (especially diesel). Silly humans. 
It didn't for me. I tried on my phone, tablet and laptop. Not sure if it makes a difference; I'm in Canada. Perhaps someone else can try the link and weigh in. Could you paste the info please? All I see is the title, stock photo of meat and the first three lines of text.

Would you say it's a [miasma of incandescent plasma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLkGSV9WDMA)?
Made into a gigantic sword... That would be pretty cool to see 
For the record, the number of atoms in the whole universe is only like 10^30-something.

So you'd have to convert a significant amount of all matter in the universe to TNT. Not even a single percent, but its still nuts to have total composition of TNT be %10^-10-ish.

https://www.cancerwa.asn.au/resources/cancermyths/talcum-powder-myth/

>Talcum powder is an interesting example of a cancer myth with a foundation in truth.  Prior to the regulation of talcum powder in 1973, the asbestos in talc could reasonably be anticipated to increase cancer risk.  Now, though, talc is processed differently and is free of asbestos. The current evidence is inconsistent and insufficient to conclude that the use of talcum powder on the external genitals increases the risk of cancer, specifically ovarian cancer.


>On the other hand confounding factors and biases can't be ruled out. But other agencies have considered this and decided to make no finding because there wasn't enough evidence.

Yeah, I'm super skeptical of this entire article for a few reasons: 1) the source, 2) the source's source, 3) no links provided to actual studies, 4) entirely correlational in nature according to the article, 5) despite a half-assed attempt, no real explanation for the mechanism explained - saying 'inflammation' is one step above saying 'toxins', 6) the studies referenced are quite old - if this was a real concern it would be better researched with a lot more recent investigations, and 7) I'm a scientist myself and this article reeks of poor scientific reporting.

Now, I'm not saying this isn't real, but I am *highly* skeptical that this article portrays the issue accurately. I'm interested now in looking at some of the primary literature on this issue. 
I use baby powder on my nether regions after each shower. I think I'd go crazy going back to swamp ass/balls.
I smell bullshit of the same variety that happened to [silicone breast implants](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html).  

edit, speln silicon to silicone

edit again: after reading the other comments in this thread, I am glad to see other people as skeptical as I am - but with data to back it up, and not just Xoebe's "smell test".
Curious study. In 1952 I was two and my brother just born. I poured him a face-full of talcum powder while mother was on the phone (as the story goes). Four years later he had a cancerous tumor the size of a grapefruit in his right lung, and later, at 11, another smaller tumor in his left lung. Both were sucessfully removed and he survived into his ate 50's. But I always felt that the powder I poured onto him (literally inside every facial opening) was the cause of the tumors. It was easier for me, I guess, to think there really was a cause of it rather than a random event. This study, flawed as it may well be, just seems to confirm my  original suspicions. I know I'll never really know, but this is quite interesting to me at least.

But I trusted science?

This is well written and how you should approach results like these. Remember that statistics can be misleading and saying something is *statistically* significant does not mean that it is necessarily significant clinically (guiding treatment etc). The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1/75. The article cites one result finding a 35% increase. This means women who use talc on their genitals were found to have 1.35/75 lifetime risk. Other studies have shown no change. Remember that statistically significant means a study means they accept a 5% chance of error. To me, this result would not have me in fear if I had been using talc, but I would change my actions in the future to avoid it.
Old talc had asbestos in it.
They laughed when I said that I didn't use baby powder! The jokes on them!
Note: talcum powder is NOT the same as cornstarch powder. Both are sold in similar containers by J&J. Use cornstarch!
 *...travel through the genital track...*
Clay causes cancer?
I am old enough to remember when they told us to put talcum powder on our sanitary napkins during Sex Ed.  I never did -- my mom did buy it and later I started using tampons. 

This is NOT NEW INFORMATION - by the late 70s there were articles linking powder (all powder) to ovarian cancer.  Something that seemed (then - who knows) to afflict upper class women more than their poorer sisters. 
What is something everyone pretty much uses...?

Deodorant 

I wonder of they have done studies on that?
[deleted]
Nonsense.  Lung cancer, maybe.  But how does talcum defy gravity to migrate to and "settle" in the ovaries? Did J&J equip each individual particle of talc with a flagellum so it can swim upward through the cervix?
These women probably all drank milk as children, too.  Why not sue the dairy industry while they're at it? 
I am now worried, because I used that stuff on my kids when they wore diapers :( 
How many babies died because they breathed in the talcum baby powder which coated their lungs and gave them pneumonia?
Why do they still sell baby powder?
We have known that this harmed babies for decades. 

I don't understand why there's not more outrage and lawsuits against J&J for this.  
That's pretty scary considering most parents put this in their babies diapers :/
Damn, I shave with clubman talc powder
 
Anyone know a good powder shaving alternative for use with an electric razor?

> I'm a scientist myself and this article reeks of poor scientific reporting.

That's because the vast majority of science is reported on within even the best of news agencies by people with next to no scientific background. Filter their content through the eyes of an editor trying to maximize viewer access numbers (through exaggeration, over emphasis on irrelevant factors or misrepresentation of findings etc. etc.) for sake of advertising sales and we get the stuff we see now. 

This leads to correlative findings being reported on as causative or as up top " item X linked to outcome B". It works to influence the perceptions of non science minded portions of the populations and to help increase "sales"... unfortunately the practice undermines and takes away from the actual quality of any real discussion related to the topic.

To fix that what we need are reporters and editors specialized in science related reporting instead of what we have now with reporters who are more interested in social and political topic reporting covering down to topics they have little understanding of.
>5) Mechanism...

Is that really a fair criticism? Do we know any mechanisms for carcinogens?

[removed]
I don't use baby powder on my nether regions and I never have swamp ass/balls...  I take it you sweat a lot?  
"I'm going to have to smell your breasts to see if you have cancer."

Sounds legit. 
From reading through some of the sources cited in the article, it appears that pre-1973, talcum powder could contain asbestos - that actually could have caused it...

>In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled. All talcum products used in homes in the United States have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.
Timeframes seem too short. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma#Signs_and_symptoms
I am fairly certain that what you actually trusted was journalistic reporting on science, which is a very different animal all-together (somewhere in the Rattus Genus I believe).
This is a problem a lot of people have. Something is great and healthful because science says so, and anyone who disagrees is an idiot. That is, until science then says it's not.
It wasn't science that failed but the corp behind it. (If true beyond doubt)
You're seriously advocating that women use cornstarch on their vaginas? I don't think you understand how vaginas work.....
They have, links to cancer and Alzheimer have been found by some, questioned by the rest. Need more studies. 
Their study is very poorly done. The [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/talcum-powder-and-cancer) has a much better summary.

TLDR: Somewhere between "does not cause any risk" and "an extremely small risk".
Because they know they won't ever be held accountable.
I disagree with your logic. Sure, theres no obvious mechanism of action, but that's no reason to draw a conclusion. It's much better to attack the methodology of the study, which in this case, is really crappy.  
Capillary action, diffusion, etc. Once a particle of talc gets into the vagina, fluid dynamics take over and gravity isn't quite as important. 
I'm thinking, there's a hole down "there" that "stuff" can get into.
Someone failed physics and never studied fluid dynamics.
Real talc, or cornstarch?  Because pretty much all "baby" powder is cornstarch and has been for a looooong time.

**EDIT:  Apparently this isn't true; there are still lots of baby powders sold that are talc, not cornstarch.**
As an older sister, I remember clouds of this stuff coming out of the babies room. Now my friends are having children and that shit is just as popular today. I put it in my hair and use it as a dry shampoo, but  I'm seeing that it's linked to lung cancer as well. There should be a huge PSA or warning label put on the bottle. 
Shaving cream?
[deleted]
I really can't figure out what your point is.  You just highlighted something I quoted and explained it like it actually needed to be explained.
>Does talcum powder cause cancer?


>When talking about whether or not talcum powder is linked to cancer, it is important to distinguish between talc that contains asbestos and talc that is asbestos-free. Talc that has asbestos is generally accepted as being able to cause cancer if it is inhaled. This type of talc is not used in modern consumer products. **The evidence about asbestos-free talc, which is still widely used, is less clear.**

Their stance is anything but firm. Further down the page, they say that the increased risk is between "none" and "very small". The only other things I can think of that the ACS says has a "very small" increased risk of cancer is eating burnt food.
Thank you for pointing that out - it definitely clears up a lot about this. 
yes, many.  especially asbestos.
Oh yeah.  In most cases, a proposed mechanism that's testable is a key factor in deciding if a link is real or not.
It does a really good job of keeping your nuts from sticking to your legs like Velcro.  I'm pretty concerned since I also apply it there after every shower.
It never really gets moist with baby powder.
Have you ever tried it? I'm not that sweaty, but after a day of work that vicinity can be rather damp and vinegary.

For Meso, yes, But he was an infant when exposed and then developed two distinct, descrete tumors, one in each lung after breathing a huge amount of powder. It still seems quite possible to me.

It's almost like science is based on evidence or something. 
Yeah, and the science says this does not cause health risk. Take five seconds to go through this comment section.

"This vagina takes only 87 octane grade carcinogens"
It just seems that cancer is pretty much non discriminating ,it has to be linked to stuff everyone uses or has used
Someone doesn't own a vagina.
Wrong. The [regular Johnson and Johnson baby powder](http://www.diapers.com/p/johnsons-baby-powder-original-22-oz-5356?qid=132605273514237006&sr=1-5) has two ingredients listed: talc and fragrance. A lot of them are cornstarch powder but the regular baby powder in most brands is talc.

My 15 month old is prone to diaper rash and I have to read the ingredient list of every baby powder I buy to make sure it's talc-free.
[From the American Cancer Society:](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/talcum-powder-and-cancer)

>Lung cancer

> Some studies of talc miners and millers have suggested an increased risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, while others have found no increase in lung cancer risk. These studies have been complicated by the fact that talc in its natural form can contain varying amounts of asbestos and other minerals, unlike the purified talc in consumer products. When working underground, miners can also be exposed to other substances that might affect lung cancer risk, such as radon.

> No increased risk of lung cancer has been reported with the use of cosmetic talcum powder.

You may continue to powder your hair freely, unless you are in a talcum mine.
Probably cornstarch. They're not the same.
I use an electric razor

his point is he is a moron.
Because implying the link is a myth (cancermyths/talcum powder myth) carries a different connotation than saying the current evidence is "inconsistent and insufficient".  

> The only other things I can think of that the ACS says has a "very small" increased risk of cancer is eating burnt food.

Not just 'burnt', but merely 'charred'.

Char-broiled pork chops… mmmmm.

Crisp bacon… mmmm
Doesn't need to be burnt http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/acrylamide.html

Prop 65 is a joke.
Please read that link carefully. It is anything but conclusive. Their actual stance is that asbestos-free talc is either an extremely mild carcinogen when used on the uterus, or not one at all.
Maybe your colleagues and I have a different definition for mechanism. From the NIH


> Nonetheless, **we still lack an understanding**of the precise nature of all of the cellular targets that are perturbed by different types of asbestos fibers, how asbestos changes the intensity and duration of signaling through specific pathways, and how information from multiple signaling events is parsed and filtered to dictate phenotypic and functional endpoints in different cell types. As asbestos-related diseases have long latency periods, poor prognoses, and limited effective therapies, **our focus remains on understanding the basic mechanisms** of toxicity and lung or pleural remodeling that will inform translational studies on disease intervention and treatment.


Ha, no, I haven't tried it.  Never really needed to.  Hey, thanks for the answer.  
Sounds like the Houston area.

Huh, that's news to me. Do you have a peer reviewed paper I could read?
Right, it's based on collection of evidence. However, the interpretation of that evidence is much more subjective than many people realize.
I was referencing /u/theseeds comment, and not the article directly. But if you want to look at the linked article:

>**Findings have been mixed**, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase. Many case-control studies have found a small increase in risk. But these types of studies can be biased because they often rely on a person’s memory of talc use many years earlier.

There are mixed findings. Nothing conclusive. So you can't "scientifically" say whether there is a health risk or not.
you ever been to california? we have signs everywhere that say stuff like "things in this building are known to cause cancer" yadda yadda yadda, hell managed to get coke to change its recipe so they could avoid having a cancer warning on their cans.....
Someone never did biology.
I stand corrected!
Go bare. I used to use an electric before (braun activator) and I never bothered putting anything on my skin. Only when I switched to wet shaving ([Merkur HD](http://badgerandblade.com/vb/showthread.php/1778-Merkur-HD)) did I start putting something on first.
Not in this case it doesn't. How would you expect the evidence for a functionally unfalsifiable myth to look if not inconsistent and insufficient? Evidence that books cause your elbows to turn into macaroni is also inconsistent and insufficient.
I'd rather eat char broiled pork chops than have a 0.002% less risk of cancer. So I've made my informed choice.

But yeah, the chance of cancer from burnt food is only significant if you blacken a piece of toast every morning for years and eat it. Same thing here, if you powder your lady bits every day for a few years, it's possible you might develop ovarian cancer. Maybe. The data is still inconclusive.
But why does my uterus itch when i powder it!?

I'm also a dude! Do I even have a uterus!?

What the HELL am I powdering then!?

What the hell is going on!??!??

AHHhHhhHHHh


>we still lack an understanding

That's just science talk.  We say everything is poorly understood, especially if we want grant money.  A quick pubmed search yields thousand of articles.  

There are many articles about the effects on cells from asbestos, and if you read and understood it all, you would probably be of the opinion that we know a lot about the mechanisms.  It might be hard to consolidate it all into one unified and easily understandable single paragraph theory, but that doesn't mean we don't know a lot about it.  That's why scientists go to school for at least a decade, to digest the mountains of information out there, and attempt to consolidate it , at least in their mind.

Also, your quote is mostly referring to lack of understanding for treatment in a translational approach.  Which is completely true, we still suck at treating cancer, that doesn't mean we don't know a shit ton about the causative mechanisms.

Hmm, never thought of that
I have very real proof

I used to work as a laparoscopic technician during these cases. It was essentially a meat grinder that would throw tissue all over the abdomen. Many more companies other than J&J had them. 

The two hospitals i worked for stopped using them and stopped doing supracervical hysterectomys. Now they do Vaginal Hysterectomys laparoscopically assisted. They have other ways of doing myomectomys too.
When they're referring to cancer spreading, they're talking about spreading it to other places in the same patients body right?  I remember some other article talking about a colonoscopy scope i think that was spreading bacteria bewteen people but i dont think this is the same situation? 

Cancer cant spread between people cause the second persons immune system would recognize it as foreign and attack it as i understand it.  It leads me to another question though... 

If someone ate a chuck of someone elses cancer of whatever type...  what would happen?  They get sick?  Cancer takes root some how?  nastiest BM ever?

These are the hard hitting questions we need answers to damnit. 
Damn it Johnson & Johnson. I said "cure cancer" not "cause cancer."
I love that at the end of the article United Healthcare has decided to make hysterectomies more difficult to get. Because that just solves the problem. Never gets old, telling women what to do with their bodies, does it?
[deleted]
Ah! Johnson & Johnson, a family held company, finally coming under attack (as will many other "non public" entities) from all angles...

This could truly turn out to be a bad half century to be alive.
This is why I am incredibly suspicious of doctors and any 'cure'. Most doctors are idiots and most of the stuff they are selling is just so they get kickbacks from they pharmaceutical reps.
The combination of the terms 'surgical tool,' 'meat grinder' and 'throw tissue all over the abdomen' give me great confidence that this is an excellent device well suited to use on human subjects.

Basically the Fibroid tumors are too large and dense to remove from a small 10mm laparoscopic Port. They would require the morcellator to shred the tissue into long strands, and this potentially cancerous tissue would fly all over the abdomen.
This device sounds like it's causing cancer cells to be spread in the patient getting a cancer removed, so it would be making the cancer worse in the long run for the patient.

There are some types of cancer that can be spread via contact though. I don't know of any in humans (cancer is not my specialty, plus humans tend to be pretty leery of rubbing each other's abnormal growths), but that's part of what is destroying [Tasmanian devil population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease).  

There are also types of bacteria known as [cancer bacteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_bacteria) that have been linked to getting cancer, though whether they cause the cancer or are just opportunistic little fuckers is often hard to tell.
Correct. It could send cancer cells to different parts of the patient's body.
I'm down!
What? Really? Oh.......oh. My bad!
They're not preventing anyone from having one, they're just not paying for it.
Generally for a vaginal hysterectomy they just push everything out through the vagina. Unless the uterus is really enlarged there's no need to break it up. Fibroid removal is different because you can't push the pieces out through the vagina (uterus is still attached and in the way) so they break up the fibroid so it can be removed through one of the laparoscopic (or robotic) port sites.
Well I hope you don't get anything you ever need antibiotics or one of the many, many other proven treatments for various diseases and illnesses we have then.  
Youd like the Lina loop then. Its basically an electrified lasso designed to precisely slice the entire uterus off of the cervix. Just make sure you dont have a ureter there!
I would say they stopped using it about a year to a year and a half ago.
You aren't funny. Just FYI since you seem to be laboring under a misapprehension.
Stage 2 to Stage 4 in 1 second 
Actually, they're paying for it if the doctor submits a prior authorization request to the insurance company.
Depending on how large it is. Football size fibroids will tend to go open.
My dad's a director of nursing at a hospital. There is just way too much bullshit in the healthcare industry. Remember Vioxx? It killed off 500,000 people: http://www.theweek.co.uk/us/46535/when-half-million-americans-died-and-nobody-noticed

I'm not saying all medicine is bogus but I don't want to guinea pig anything ever after what I've heard about.

Look at his profile, that's all he does is make dumb comments , calls people homo. I appreciate some health professionals didn't wait for these greedy companies to pull their products, thanks for the common sense.
I am surgical procedure guy. And *this*.. is my surgical tool. It shreds uterine fibroid tumors with precision-shrouded stainless steel blades whirling at 2 thousand rotations per minute. It costs your insurance four hundred thousand dollars to have me operate this instrument *for 12 seconds*.

I'm kinda curious about these 46 DDs
No pictures, move on.
Well on the bright the autism is no longer his biggest problem... 
[deleted]
In the SF Bay Area, lawyers are already running commercials asking parents of autistic children using this drug to contact them if their child has developed large breasts. Finally, I know the story behind them.
1. Fuck them for giving their autistic kid a powerful antipsychotic with WELL KNOWN AND SERIOUS side effects, not to mention the evidence that it does anything at all for autism other than sedate kids is tenuous at best.

2. Did I mention gynecomastia is a well known side effect? It was seen in trials. It's documented. It's in the prescribing information. If you didn't read the info you got with the medication you are giving to your child, you are useless to me.
My daughter was on Risperdal for about 2 years. We recently switched her meds because her prolactin levels were extremely high, so she was growing breasts.
That bigger than my dad's 
So genetically engineered knockers aren't cheaper than silicone after all
Pretty stupid decision of them to take this to trial.
I'd put this on /r/NotTheOnion for extra stuffs
Here ya go

http://www.1800baddrug.com/images/gynecomastia.jpg
46 band size = really fat. DD just means that there is a 5" difference between the bust and underbust measurements. Proportionally, it's not that dramatic when your underbust is 46 inches. A 30DD looks great, 46DD not so much. 

Those measurements are just a fat guy with moobs. If his parents had managed his weight better, he probably would look pretty normal. 

For men, being fat increases the amount of estrogen present in the system, and being fat during puberty can easily cause boys to develop breasts.
Think Meatloaf in Fight Club.
/r/Imgoingtohellforthis
Seems like the way to go.
one can hope. 
It was off label promotion by J&J 

The case has drawn attention for a few reasons. For one, this was the first lawsuit claiming J&J hid the risks of gynecomastia to go to trial after a handful of cases were settled in recent years. The trial also served as a reminder that J&J paid $2.2 billion two years ago to resolve criminal and civil allegations of illegally marketing Risperdal to children and the elderly.

Moreover, former FDA commissioner David Kessler served as a paid expert witness for the family and testified that J&J knew about the risks associated with Risperdal, but failed to disclose the data showing the extent to which youngsters may develop gynecomastia. In a report prepared for a 2012 case that was settled, Kessler wrote that J&J’s Janssen unit, which marketed the drug, had violated the law.
J7J knew it, FDA commissioner testified against them. Follow the $, that's all I can say.  If anyone really believes that they care if you live or die, they are greatly mistaken.

Pics or GTFO
Absolutely especially considering they settled withe Feds about a year ago for off-label promotion for kids and elderly.  Nothing like killing a few old folks in nursing homes who were on various cardiac drugs or who had dementia....mixed together its toxic
Thanks!  Appreciate the advice greatly!
>If his parents had managed his weight better

yes, but isn't weight gain often a side effect of risperdal?


also, thanks for all the boob knowledge. Seems useful. 
My chest is 44 and my waist is 34. I might be 25 lbs. over my ideal weight but wouldn't say fat. I have no boobs that I need a bra to wear. 

This guy chest under his boobs is 46, Two inches up it's 51.  
The first time I took brand-name Risperdal was in 2005. I can't speak for what was included in the documentation for the drug before that, but I doubt the prescribing information for a brand name medication was different a few years later since it is based on studies done before the drug is sold. Gynecomastia was clearly listed as a possible side effect for men, and my psychiatrist made me aware of it.

Yes, they knew it. The only thing I guess they might have hidden is how likely it was?

Edit: I should also point out that at the time, Risperdal did not have pediatric approval, which means it was prescribed to this kid off-label, which makes it even worse. Sure, give my child a medication that hasn't even been tested or approved for children his age.
There's no such thing as a medication that will magically add fat to your body. If it affects energy levels or appetite, dietary intake must be adjusted accordingly.
I highly doubt this guy has a 46" chest because he's muscular and works out. If he had a decent body fat percentage, he wouldn't have moobs. TBH, if you're 25 lbs over a good weight, that sounds kind of fat, too. 

Around 70% of American men are fat (overweight or obese), so it's easy to lose sight of what a healthy weight should look like. Guys at a healthy weight get called too skinny, overweight guys think they're fit, and obese guys think they are just a few pounds overweight.

I'm just on the healthy side of the BMI chart. I'm 47, so I no longer care. 
Really? The few times I was on steroids, I had to force myself to eat. I've heard it can go either way, but definitely not after you stop taking them. I still gained ten pounds, though, since it causes you to retain a ton of water. I know you were making a joke, but it's a really bad one.
That's totally fine, but being 47 doesn't mean you have to give up on a nice body. Have you heard of [Ernestine Shepherd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernestine_Shepherd)? She didn't even start working out until she was 56, and at 78 she has an amazing body. 
Sorry I'm 48. The mind is the first to go. 
Haha, something to look forward to, I guess. 
how much tylenol are we talking about here? Its my headache go to
Yeh uh. Consumers inability to read clearly printed warnings isnt the manufacturers fault.
Original comment:  This is incredibly disappointing but I guess not terribly surprising. I also don't think this will be the end of litigation.

Edit:

From the article:

> That meant the jury didn’t address Jackson’s other claims, including whether the margin of safety between a safe dose of Tylenol and a potentially harmful dose is adequate.

So, there's still possible litigation against whether or not the FDA approved dosage is still safe. 
[removed]
Aspirin is less harmful, I've heard.
No one has answered your question so I will. 1 Extra Strength tylenol is 500mg (Acetaminophen). The current medical standard is 4 grams per 24 hrs. So 8 pills.

The FDA recommended lowering to 3 grams, they complied. I worked in a pharmacy for 7 years and to me, this is complete nonsense. 

There are other dosages of Tylenol. Like arthritic, which are 650mg. And regular strength at 350. So it does get confusing, but we are talking about a stupid number of pills. 
Lessnthan 3 grams a day. It used to be 4 but the current "best practice" is 3 (lije you could do 4 grams in a day once in awhile and probably be ok but why risk it?)

And the liver uses the same enzyme to break it down that it uses to break down alcohol hence avoid taling with alcohol

Those are the two biggies
The recommended dosage appears to be too high and can cause damage after 24 hours of continued usage (using recommended standards). 
There are no printed warnings about toxicity. Rtfa.
>As reported in 2013 by ProPublica and This America Life, McNeil has previously opposed warning labels, dosage restrictions and even public awareness campaigns over concerns about profitability.

So... you didn't bother to read the article, did you?

*But you just couldn't wait to give your oh-so-valuable opinion, huh?*
This is why they invented drugs like oxycontin. People with chronic pain who had to take lots of Vicodin were getting liver damage
The blanket statement of "less harmful" is really misleading. Taking NSAIDs with some medical conditions could cause death. If you have stomach ulcers, taking any NSAID is extremely painful and makes your condition worse.

If you have a condition affecting liver function, taking acetaminophen would be incredibly bad.

Every OTC analgesic has it's place. None is more or less dangerous than others. Take medication correctly and it's perfectly safe. 
how about two pills of extra strength once ever 3 days or so?
Are ppl soooo dumb that they think max daily dose is there for fun of it? These ppl are losers who blame everyone but themselves and want everything for free, without working for it. Obviously, I know all of them.
"Do not exceed more than 4 grams a day" , "take 2 tablets every 6 hours" , "do not take with other medications containing acetaminophen"

If you are an adult and you think OTC medicines are candies im sorry , but thats not the companies fault.

Go grab a bottle and look for yourself
No dumbass. Im a nurse. Yeh thats shady but guess whats on every bottle of acetaminophen sold in the US? A clearly spelled out warning in the kings english

Go grab a bittle and read the back and come let us know what it says NOT to do
That's 1000mg right? The max single dose is 1000 and the max daily dose is 4000mg. You will more than likely be ok. I try to change up the pain relievers I use. One time its two ibuprofen, another time two aspirin, and sometimes two Tylenol ( spread out over a long period of time, I don't use N-SAIDS or pain relievers often) . I'm paranoid though so you're probably fine.
it's 3 grams, not 4 grams. Did you read the article?
YES. Did you? The manufacturers havent been forced tochange the labels yet to catchup with medical knowledge (4 grams is ok sometimes but too much for hronic users)

That was some of the info the jury didnt get to hear because it was thrown out before the prosecutor could bring it up.
> The manufacturers havent been forced tochange the labels yet to catchup with medical knowledge

And why, oh nurse, do you think this is?
No. I agree. We have middle school reading comprehension in most adults in this country , the interest of public safety should trump this companies bottom line profits.

To answer your question in a technical sense? The fda doesnt have the funds to do all the things we want it to

But to get back to the matter at hand the bottles also say to contact a physician if symptoms persist for x number of days (my bottle of generic says 10 but im sure this particular bit differs)

IMO? These people didnt get liver damage from taking the max dose for the maximum recommended days. They overdosed in one way or another or took it with alcohol and hurt yhemselves and decided to try to make some cash.

If the bottle said 3 grams a day max dose people would still not read t and hurt themselves. If it had a picture of an injured liver and red letter warnings theyd do the same (just less) . You cant legislate stupid away.
>These people didnt get liver damage from taking the max dose for the maximum recommended days. 

I feel like this thread can be divided into people who have  [heard the This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/505/use-only-as-directed) story and those who have not.

People have died taking the *prescribed dose.* Including infants (check out act two). 

Toxicity is a complicated issue, but there are much safer drugs available now. The number of lawsuits is only going to increase. You're right. People want their payday. I would even say people want revenge. 
So they can increase 6000 jobs in marketing?
But the teevee says the economy is wonderful.
They have 127,000 worldwide employees and about 2% or 2,540 individuals will be fired. Here's a tidbit for the uncomfortable amount of shills in this thread saying it's ACA this, ACA that:

> The restructuring focuses on the company’s orthopedics, surgery and cardiovascular businesses. It won’t affect consumer medical devices, pharmaceuticals or consumer businesses.
> 
> J&J has struggled to revive sales of medical devices, particularly brands like DePuy orthopedic implants and Ethicon surgical equipment. In October the company said device sales dropped 7.3 percent to $6.1 billion in the previous fiscal quarter. In the same month, J&J sold its Cordis heart devices unit, which previously accounted for about one-quarter of device sales.
> 
> Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen noted that medical devices have been “one of the weaker performing businesses in recent years.”
Major businesses reorganize all the time, just part of the business world
Aca doing its socialist duty of destruction of the private sector.
Or.....the 10% medical device tax in the ACA took its first victims.
Well, the ACA is kind of busy fucking over people who can't afford it.
How is it socialist?
"squeezed by a weakening global economy and unfavorable currency exchange rates."

please explain how the ACA impacted exchange rates.  
Because Obama passed it...not Congress.

Probably a robot.
When I got my implant I wasn't given any choices.  The surgeon just used what he preferred.  Luckily not this one. I'm on my second one and a different brand this time.  If I didn't ask he wouldn't have even told me what model he used. I'm not complaining.  Everything is fine. But how do you know if you have a problem when you don't even know?  It's like if ford did a recall but you're not sure what model you own.

Too little too late.

Real soap never required toxins.
People shouldn't just jump to conclusions when they see the word formaldehyde. As with anything, the dose makes the poison. Just as an example, formaldehyde is found in very low concentrations in [vaccines](http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm) given to infants, where it is found to be safe.
Hmm, well guess I'm not buying JJ anymore until I hear more about this...and they already have a formula they sell to other nations? How is it that expensive to transition over to something they already use everywhere else?!

One would think some governmental body could have headed this off. Maybe that is why Rick Perry wants to get rid of the, uh, umm, johnson division? 
Here's a fun and educational video that explains what real soap is and also what fake soap is. (hint: J&J is fake soap) As a bonus it includes amusing news coverage about how Police field drug tests will claim that real soap is... Drugs!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6E19OUBNhM
The levels of formaldehyde in the product weren't even dangerous. At worst, you might get contact dermatitis from it. And the fact that it was removed in products in Europe is hardly surprising, because Europe is notoriously more likely to remove various chemicals on the basis of the precautionary principle rather than any evidence that there are harmful effects.
No, it was Johnson's.
You probably shouldn't look at the ingredients in other soap, then.
Oxygen is a poison depending on how you look at it.

Current regulatory departments in the US exist to rubber-stamp what corporate America wants.  I almost agree with "de-regulation" if it eliminates the harmful influence of bogus oversight, except that the Republicans consider the best way to illustrate the harm of "big government" is by making it as harmful as possible.
Dr. Bronners, act like you know.

I'm only sticking up for science education. Science can tell us whether the formaldehyde-releasing preservative is harmful or not, but our gut reactions to a word can't.

I agree that it isn't a bad idea to use something else.
>Not sure why you are sticking up for a corporations use of harmful chemicals on babies...

Wow. It would be difficult to load the issue any more than that. 

I have an anti-bear rock to sell you if you are interested.
Your own body probably has as much naturally occurring formaldehyde as is found in these products, if not more.

Seriously, you probably think I'd change my mind...but I wouldn't. My brother and I are both ex-medics. We (including my mother) have all agreed that if we were in some fucked up condition that was just wayy too much and we'd pretty much have no life...we'd just be existing...we'd fill one syringe with morphine and one with insulin...shoot both into the IV and have whichever family member die of an OD + diabetic coma.

Fuck that life.

This seems pretty rare... I don't think it is really fair on Johnson & Johnson. Choose anything... there is someone out there allergic to it.
Just pay the money, they have made billions off the product, throwing a little back to cover this is just the cost of doing business.
I am inclined to agree.
Out of curiosity, why both? An attempt to avoid charges? Redundancy? 
Because of emotional connection and because people don't like setting a standard of a life not worth living.
That's called a living will.  There are a lot of people who think the same thing and want the plug pulled under certain conditions.  20% lung function is not enough to keep you alive on your own.  Let alone no skin.

For those not aware [this is what the cancer council has to say](http://www.cancercouncil.com.au/86105/cancer-information/general-information-cancer-information/cancer-questions-myths/clothing-cosmetics-tattoos/there-is-inconclusive-evidence-that-using-talcum-powder-can-cause-cancer/) about talc and cancer. The TL;DR version can be summed up with this quote.     

> Several studies in women have looked at the possible link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer, with mixed findings. Some studies report a slightly increased risk, while others have found no increase. **The evidence is insufficient to conclude that use of talcum powder leads to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.**    

So with this in mind, a jury ruled in favour of a plaintiff who could not and did not demonstrate any causal link between the use of this product and the cancer that killed the plaintiff's loved one, to the tune of $72M. That is a grave injustice that I suspect has more to do with the current fashion towards hating on corporations and feeling they should "pay". 
Good. Fuck those profit whores.

If you can patent and sell a prescription fucking ketamine analogue, why are we not using LSD to treat alcoholism?! Tons of psychedelics, dissociatives, and other recreational drugs have shown enormous promise in treating a myriad of ailments, and many aren't even as risky/harmful as ketamine.
This is a re-spun press release from J&J. And an 11-drug pipeline by 2017 isn't even that impressive.

I worked at a psyche ward type place for a while. I had tons of Resperdal pens. Whenever I heard of a new drug, or saw a drug rep wandering around, I would always be... skeptical and inquisitive.

I never heard any of the people who administer psyche meds ask these questions. Never. One of the reasons that I am hypercritical of the psychopharm industry is that I know how little skepticism there is amongst psychopharmacologists about the companies and their products that profit off of their patients.

Yes, but when white people do it the narrative is "innocent until proven guilty" and "women make false accusations" and "well maybe she wasn't being very safe" and "let's not ruin young men's lives over this", remember? 
"In November, the teen accused in the stabbing filed a lawsuit against Keys Gate Charter School in Homestead."

That was filed by an attorney who makes his money going around the country and filing these charges in the hopes of bullying people out of money. And is barred from Orgeon and floridia court due to credibility problems.

http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-sex-abuse-attorney-was-707348

"The Miami Herald is not identifying her because the newspaper does not typically name victims of sex crimes."

And in what has become typical SJW journalism sees rapists under every rock even though

"Police closed an investigation into the allegations without pressing charges, said lawyer Jeff Herman, who is representing the young woman in her lawsuit against Keys Gate."

but even though there is no evidence

"But that is not uncommon in sex assault cases since evidence can be hard to collect."

It still happened. Listen and Believe in full effect. So its totally unfounded just a convenient sympathy story the defense is using to try and get this girl out of trouble.
Friend met a girl at a club and they had a 1 night stand.

End of story right?

Nope. 

Girl actually had a bf that she didn't tell friend about.

Girl's bf found out about the 1 night stand.

She convinced her bf and herself that she had been rape by my friend.

Used rape as excuse for cheating on her bf.

Not every case is like this.

 But some women never see themselves at fault and just blame others.
Wanna take bets she has a tumblr account?
There's absolutely no story in that article.
Premeditation. As much as she may have been a victim it's not like she packed some pepper spray, sounds like she had intent and planned it beforehand. 
Add that to the information above and a much different picture starts to form. 
That saddest thing is - it'll probably work.
What would be nice if they prosecuted the rich with **at least ** the same fierceness that they attack the poor.
Anyone who ever got into a fight with Trump on Twitter must be terrified right now. 
Trump's campaign has been like a post on /r/holdmybeer, when the person is successful against impossible odds. 
If Trump can get elected President you can ask that girl out. C'mon, what are you waiting for?

Whatever happens tonight...I doubt that the turmoil ends anytime soon. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it continues in the next election
The real winner tonight is gonna be alcohol, boys. 
Well  at least south Park will be comedy gold  for the next few seasons.

I can't stop picturing Mr. Garrison.
"Oh shit we are actually winning?! What are we gonna do??"
At this point, I'm just a little relieved that the campaign season is over.  It seems like it's getting longer every time.

Although I'm a little annoyed about a family member who has spent weeks ranting about how terrible Trump is, but did they go to vote? No.  
PBS: "We could be watching the greatest political upset in American history."
at least we're getting young justice season 3.
"We'll have more tomorrow"

You're going to do this then? You're really going to drag this out. You lost. Give the speech.
CNN shows Trump 76 to 68 Clinton on electoral. MSNBC shows 75 to Clinton and 72 to Trump. Who the hell is making these numbers.  
So it is true. Hilary Clinton is more hated than Donald Trump. Can't help but think how it would have been had Bernie been in the race.
Is this real life?
A marvelous example of snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory.

This election honestly should have been a cake-walk for either party, but instead we've got this now.
What's going on with Pennsylvania, it's like 1am there.  I swear, it's because of the amish.
>Donald Trump: There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, "No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private."

>Donald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.

I hope and I pray that he is fully committed to following through on what he says here.
Everyone on the planet is feeling that same tension you're feeling right now.  
Remember folks, it's just 4 years in the 4.5 billion year life of the earth or 6000 years depending on your party. 
I read that people have send thousands of votes to bull shit stuff like Harambe. Wrestler Matt Hardy also received a 1000 votes. WTF AMERICA!
Huh, I honestly didn't expect Hillary would lose.
Sometimes it feels like every country is competing to embarrass itself on the international stage, each determined not to be outdone by the other.

As a Brit after Brexit, I'm not going to pass any judgements on the American population regardless of how this election pans out. That said, the thought of Trump as the President of America is really not a comforting one...
Congrats Democrats. You had Bernie as a great candidate, and you asswipes had to go with scandalous Hillary 
We're entering 2017 without lube.
Dow down over 800 points

the thing that scares me most isn't that trump won, but that 1 party has control of the house, senate, and white house.....nothing good can come of any 1 party having control of all 3
I can't wait for Hilary's concession speech. Losing to donald trump. I mean, I'm nearly speechless at how bad this whole thing must have been mangled from start to finish in order for this to happen. Its so absurd its comical. President Donald Trump. let that ring for a bit. 

what planet am I on?
Everything Sucks 2016
I love America. 

*Have enough money to fund a campaign?*

*0% political experience?*

 **Run for president!** 

Let's, please, try to remember:

Tomorrow we are all still Americans, friends and neighbors. We can disagree, just don't be a dick. No violence, no hatred, no attacking each other. Everyone has the right to their opinions. You don't have to respect the opinions, but you have to respect the right. 

Stay safe. 

Be excellent to each other. 

Party on. 
There had been many posts, comments, threads, etc. that talked about how corrupt politics had become, how Hillary held sway over the media, etc.  Now that the election results reflect something different than what the media portrayed, namely Hillary up by as much as 4% 24 hours ago, to losing by a decisive margin, does this prove that corruption, or does it just indicate that media in general like to create their own drama and try to project their influence on the populous?
The worst part about this is that the entire government is now republican, and he's likely going to get to choose 3 supreme court seats. Hopefully he's been trolling all along and is actually a moderate.
To the couple dozen Europeans on this thread, calling Americans idiots: remember that populist parties with nationalistic, backwards and in some cases worryingly anti-democratic and authoritarian agendas have been on the rise in basically every European nation for years now, long before Trump became a candidate. We Euros have nothing to feel smug about here.
Bernie would have better chance against Hillary. Democrats fucked themselves in the ass
How the fuck is this happening?
Do you remember when they said Bernie Sanders was unelectable?

Well, they can eat their shorts.
The Night America was grabbed by the Pussy
Watching election HQ coverage is a laugh.  Trump''s  HQ looks like a fucking frat party, and Clinton''s looks like Lilith fair.  How the fuck am I supposed to relate to any of this shit.  
This election will go in the record books not for how Trump won but how Clinton lost. Let this be a lesson to the DNC and the media, their marketing and corruption did fuck all but allow Trump to be president. Sucks to be Hilary this morning lol
This shit with Florida is crazy.
How the fuck does someone meme his way into the White House?
This just in, Trump launches new company. "Brawndo" it has what plants need. It has electrolytes.
Remember what Vladimir Lenin said:

"Shit's broke, yo. Overthrow the bourgeoisie"
It's not over till CNN is on fire and the front page has someone with a picture of themselves leaving the country on it.
A third of the pundits look like they're holding back tears of pain, another third tears of joy, and the final third laughter at the ridiculousness of this all.
Looks like Trump is going to win. I'm kind of surprised, but not that surprised. A lot of people hate Trump and a lot of people hate Clinton. But Trump has a very serious support base, whereas Clinton hasn't inspired that kind of support.

The truth is, politicians aka. politricksters are going to fuck you either way. The only question for is which candidate would personally screw me over the worst.
The democrats honestly deserve this for burying Bernie, who probably would've won. And this Is coming from a liberal. 
The only thing I can say now is, I guess the fucking stupid DNC will now start caring about voters opinions. Sanders had overwhelming support. But no, they just had to go with Clinton. Fucking high horse cocky idiots. I bet you thought Clinton making memes of herself ("I'm just chillin!") and dabbing would make her a shoe in. Well guess what. You fucked yourselves, AND US over. I cannot believe the fucking stupidity. 
 favorite part: "People who disliked both candidates are voting 2:1 in favor of trump"

The democrats were gifted this election. GJ guys. selected the one candidate that is literally less likable than Donald Trump
Let's just get this over with
Oh the red, white and blue

Oh the funny things you do

America, America this is you
Trump negged his way into the White House. 

Well, crap. 
Is this what we get for having the Cubs win? Trading one curse for another...
I feel genuinely sick.
If this election has taught me one thing, it's how out of touch Reddit is with the real world.
Good luck Amerika! I hope we will still be friend tomorrow
PA should be calling it soon since they got 99% of the votes counted, and Trump is winning by 100,000 votes. 
Way to stay impartial there, CNN. It's over. You can't fearmonger your opinion on the election at this point.
If America were a marriage, we would have divorced and split kids and assets a loooooooooong time ago.

This is the most dysfunctional group of people cohabitating on the planet......and we have nukes!

Holy mother of god.
Democrats would have won easily with Bernie. lol.
[deleted]
So where is all the outrage about Hillary not coming out to concede? What an embarrassment.
On the bright side redditors, this will finally rid us all of any future Clinton presidential campaigns.
"She has always been with you" but where is she now?
I just want to say that if Hillary wins then Bill will be the first person ever to become First Lady after being president. 
It's scary. What kind of gets me is that if you look at the state by state stuff, it's not a case of a closely run election across all states. Red states often voted for trump by 2-1, while blue voted for hillary 2-1. It's a pretty damn big cultural divide, and the map is literally split between coasts and everywhere else, with a few liberal flyover states.

I think the Democrats really underestimated how much popular support their positions had, and that this might be the whole culture war focus backfiring hard on them. Still kind of stunned though.
Melania Trump as First Lady
I don't even know what to say. I am sickened by this election.
Democrats don't get out and vote like Republicans do, especially among the 18-25 age group. I have several pro-Hillary friends who have been talking about the election non-stop this year but didn't get out to vote despite their being a voting station on our college campus that took me about 2 minutes to get through. Votes count, polls don't. I didn't want him to win, but this is what the DNC gets for shoving Clinton, probably the most disliked politician in modern history, down our throats. The sun will still rise tomorrow. I'm more worried about the Republicans possibly gaining control of both the House and Senate. They are more extreme in their views than Trump is. 
Sure picked a bad week to try and go sober
*Whoever wins, we all lose.*
That reporter for CNBC reporting from Wellesley College looked like she was about to start crying.
Trump just extended his lead in PA to more than twenty five thousand.  His lead in Michigan is larger still.  New Hampshire will come down to the wire though, that's for sure.
I remember a lot of Democrats/Liberals saying after the 2008 and 2012 elections how the Republicans would never get the whitehouse again.   How the 2012 electoral map was going to be the norm for the next 30 years.
Who's not accepting the results now? Pennsylvania is Trump, she's half a bottle deep now.
This is like watching the Titanic about to hit an iceberg.
If and its a big Fucking IF at 9:49 PM EST The blame squarely lies with the Fucking Democratic Fucking Party shoving Fucking HRC down the peoples Fucking throats. Fucking Biden, Bernie, any-fucking-other fucking eligible American would have beat Fucking Trump.....Its happening...unreal....buckle fucking up 
If you haven't done so yet and you are able,  go vote.  Good luck America,  may we not fuck this up.
What I don't understand about US politics is why the american working class votes right to the extent it does. Is it because of "social policies" like gun control and christian values like anti-abortion or what?
In the height of the US election, the canadian immigration website goes down.
http://i.imgur.com/RlBdH0g.jpg
is this gona be like brexit where tmrw they interview ppl and they're like: 'oh it was a protest vote i didn't think he'd win', or, 'i was just doing it to be funny'?
You had Bernie, America! You had Bernie! And you voted for Hillary...
Middle America hates liberals and the establishment and it showed today. You can only call people dumb racist bigots so long before they put their middle finger up and embrace it. As a middle American I don't agree with it but I see why they feel that way. 
Not that surprising, but [California approved recreational marijuana](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html).

Clinton should have clutched defeat from the jaws of victory in the primaries, but DNC meddling may have allowed her to do it in the general election instead. Nice job.
it just goes to show when the silent majority decides to turn up to vote then big surprises can happen. even after brexit i didn't fully comprehend the anger amongst the working class/silent majority around britain and the world but trump winning has made it very clear.

News media gotta keep you in suspense. There's millions to be made
New Hampshire is currently for Trump. He is 15 votes ahead. ***FIFTEEN***
Trump is now up by fifty thousand at least in Pennsylvania and Michigan.  Awaiting Hillary's concession speech.
so...the real elections next week right?
That's it. Game over. She called to concede on the phone.
Well, if things go to shit at least I can say "Don't blame me, I'm from Virginia".

Both candidates awful about this of course..."I will appoint candidates who will..." (make decisions that align with particular positions). Disgusting. How about appointing candidates who will try to apply the law with objectivity, impartiality and fairness? I guess I'm old-fashioned and naive. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3fkOmbuK04
It's so nice to know that Trump will not take a vacation or accept a salary while being president. He promised.
Canadian here: why didn't you choose Bernie? Serious question 
You know... It's kind of funny.

Clinton pulled every trick in the book to ensure her victory, and become the first woman president. Shes made backroom deals with big banks, wall street, ect, she used to media to run constant smear campaigns against her opponents, making sure she got a minute of positive news for every second others got, outright lied about what she stood for to the people, received debate questions before the debates happened, her friends in the DNC even (allegedly) rigged the primaries to ensure she would win... She had near limitless resources to make sure that the people would vote for her, and she used them.

And yet... Despite all this, she might actually lose to a shaved orangutan in a toupee. 

EDIT: correction, she LOST to a shaved orangutan in a toupee. 
Van just went full retard on CNN.

Since Trump got elected he says that he now knows that half of the American hate people that look like him (black).

I think it's safe to say that is a bit of a leap.
It's time America.  Today we were asked to choose between a sycophant in a pantsuit, an orange narcissistic sociopath, a guy who doesn't know what cities he'll be bombing if he becomes President, and a hippie chick who doesn't know what a nuclear panner plant is but wants to shut them down anyway.  Oh, and a dead gorilla.  

May we choose wisely. 
We could've had Bernie... ugh.
I gotta go lay out some pants. I don't think I want to be caught in my undies when the Great Old Ones return in a couple hours to devour the Earth and consume the living. 

It was a great run, guys - thanks for everything.
if this is the president we elect, this is the president we deserve
I don't know what lesson is to be learned here. Maybe this is a wake up call and America will be better off in 4 years. Also I'm going to start writing, have a few ideas rolling around in my head. If Trump can be President then I want to be an Author. 
I miss Bernie :(
Hillary goes silent into the night. Not a word to her crying heart broken supporters. 
I predict a new reality series 'How to catch a Clinton'  hosted by President Trump
I can't wait to see Hollywood go batshit crazy.

A bit of real talk here Reddit. Even if your preffered candidate doesn't win that does not signal the end of the world or a giant cataclysmic event. Just like the fear around Brexit causing a global meltdown was overestimated, the consequences of this election will fade into the ether and while some changes will occur, it won't be the end of the world. 
Please chill

Watching the media during this is just fascinating. So many of them are on the edge of a nervous breakdown. 

I was watching CBS and I shit you not, Scott Pelley turned to the camera and said (paraphrasing) "We just want to remind the viewers that red stands for Trump and blue for Clinton." Totally serious, that's how much his brain is short circuiting. He thought that was pertinent information in the middle of a segment. 
[deleted]
We can now safely say, that there is no way Hillary Clinton wins, congratulations Dems, you handed the presidency to Donald. Fucking. Trump. 
I guess people are sick of the status quo, same as Brexit
Seems like the DNC really screwed the pooch on this one. Should have gone with Bernie.
The media got played so hard.  I couldn't help but wonder why the media gave him Trump so much attention.  Turns out it backfired and they are left looking like total idiots.  They actually had Hillary up by 5% in every poll the day before the election.  Hilarious.

This is the fault of a two party system.
I'm not American and i'm not a trump supporter but i'm sick of celebrities on social media etc trying to tell people how to vote and that anyone who votes against them is wrong. They are probably one of the biggest reasons for people voting for someone like Trump. No one gives a shit what they have to say and in Hillary's case I think it just contributed to her image as corrupt.
I love that CNN starts blaming Jill Stein and Gary Johnson now.

Ok America, this shit isn't funny anymore...
I know we disagree on a bunch of things, friends. I wholeheartedly believe that Trump would be far worse for our nation going forward than anything Hillary could do. I ended up voting Johnson here in Oklahoma as a protest vote (we're so solidly red and gerrymandered not even one county goes blue in these elections). 

But just because I don't like Trump doesn't mean I don't respect you as fellow Americans. I don't deny that you have the same right I do to help pick the next President. I don't deny that you are my fellow citizens. Remember that no matter how this election goes, we're all in the ship together, so keep us all as safe as you can, and good luck to you in tonight's races.

Thank you for your time.

Pundits on CNN talking as if they saw this coming. Their analyses would be a lot more impressive if they were given 24 hours ago.
I doubt it, but maybe the media will realize that saying something untrue as loud and as often as you can doesn't make it true
There were about 15 million less voters then the 2004 election on the democrats side, and about 500 thousand less republicans voted then in 2004. 
If the DNC had opened its eyes and seen the momentum that Bernie Sanders was gaining, he already had the popular vote and would of been a much stronger candidate then Hillary, she had her ego set for the position of President, and that is what opened the door for our new Celebrity President. 
Regardless of how this goes I think a big issue is that next election America needs to get their shit together. What a fucking joke. 
It's a bit scary to think that the entire government is Republican now. There's just too much power in their hand, that too in the most powerful country in the world. If mismanaged then the whole world is pretty much affected.

Also Canada's citizen and immigration website is down lol.

Trump didn't win. The DNC lost. You fuck over your energized base, don't be surprised when they won't come out.
Fuck all the candidates, prep for war.

I've got my fallout bunker ready.

As much as I despise both Hillary and Trump I'm hoping Hillary wins this. As a New Yorker I've already had enough of Trump since before he became a candidate.
Both candidates are shit.
This is like that alternative Biff Tannen timeline in Back To The Future. 
Can anyone explain why Clinton got the nod over Sanders?
Somewhere, Jeb Bush is sitting in his room with his nightlight on and his glow in the dark stars on his walls praying that somehow Trump doesn't win
soo...she's the type of lady that lawyers up and does multiple state recounts...right?
Someone go adjust the doomsday clock
Bad sportsmanship for not speaking to her supporters at least.  

And seriously now, what are the chances Clinton comes out tomorrow and claims the vote was hacked?  


holy shit i'm not ready for the /r/The_Donald reaction
On the bright side, the comedy gold mine future is surging tonight

This is the Hunger Games election. To all of these people decrying "the racist bigots in flyover country," YOU are the citizens of Capitol City, and those "toothless deplorables" live in the Districts.  They already know you despise them and condescend to them, which is why they just gave you the finger.

Also, think of 1992.  Bill Clinton won big because these same white working class "deplorables" voted for him instead of the out-of-touch old establishment guy.  The media could have seen this coming if they stepped out of the coastal cities once in a while.  (Also, these same voters stood by Bill during his impeachment-- do you think they care about a candidate's sexual foibles all that much?  "It's the economy, stupid.")
Who wants to bet it goes to the supreme court?

Edit: (1am EST) OH. MY. GOD. I didn't think Kanye vs Trump was going to be a real thing ... 
If we're lucky, a third party candidate takes a swing state and denies both of them the 270!
[deleted]
Amazing how bad both candidates are.
oh geeeezzz.......
The only good thing to come out of this election will be that South Park episode
Buckle up, buckaroos!
I can't wait for the next South Park.... gonna be epic...
isn't it funny how around this time every 4 years everyone is suddenly a studied scholar regarding politics? 
By the results, it looks like almost nobody who hates Trump actually got up to go vote today. This is so depressing because it was so preventable.
The calls are based on statistical trends and exit polls meaning it's mostly just an opinion. 
Every news station shows their narrative and vote counts. It will be different across the board
They dont all call the same states at the same time so their numbers will reflect that difference. Nate Silver is keeping [a state by state](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-night-forecast-2016/) chart that is kinda good to follow. 
Bernie would have land-slided Trump.

But the DNC had to have their princess.
I would have voted for Bernie..
For some, a fantasy.
Honestly it felt better voting out Mr. Arpaio. I hope he is gone this year
I had ignored Beck for so long, then happened upon some comments and articles just this evening that seem to indicate that he's had a huge change of heart. He's openly admitted that a lot of his paranoid conspiracy theories, angry rants and outlandish claims came from a dark place and he regrets that. He's spoken out about some newfound respect for the President and had some wonderful things to say about the First Lady's speech from a few weeks back transcending politics. He still seems like he's a pretty staunch conservative, but he appears to have a real desire for mutual understanding and calm, reasoned debate. And Trump scares the hell out of him.

Think about that. GLENN BECK thinks Trump is unreasonable.
I... I don't know what to make of this world anymore. Is up still up? Or is it down? Is yellow still a color? DO BEARS STILL SHIT IN THE WOODS?!?!
"Well it certainly isn't our fault." 
Do you think Bernie will be alive in four years?
"How do we avoid prosecution?" is probably high up on that list.
I make that 2020 if I were you.
You  need a wall. 
PBS basically just said they both nominated the worst candidates possible 
Watching from across the pond my whole family has refused to believe Trump could actually win. I've been betting against them. Just a fiver or tenner here and there. Wake up to horrified household me saying I toadaso.

I did the same with Brexit. They didn't believe we'd leave. I made a whopping 20 quid betting against them then too. 

Good luck and best wishes America! It's gonna be a crazy ride.
That goes quadruple for us actual Americans.
DNC fucked up big time
Don't forget the supreme court.
And even though it shouldn't be political, most of the SCOTUS.
Americans better hope for a vast and enduring filibuster from Democratic senators. Otherwise, I wonder what 24 million Americans having their healthcare wrenched from them would do.
[deleted]
Clinton made the same mistake the British made during Brexit. There's an entire demographic out there that don't really give a shit about politics, and they've always been just fine. They don't bother to vote, or their votes are more or less evenly distributed, because they don't feel that either party represents them. They don't give all that much of a shit about foreign policy, legislation or really anything that happens over there in Washington, because nothing ever changes all that much *for them* anyway. 

Trump targeted that demographic directly. He gave the ones that don't bother voting a reason to come out, and the ones that vote because they wanted a free pin a side to get behind. 

Add in the fact that the rest of the voting public had their normal thinking switched around on them - instead of voting for the best candidate, they had to decide which one sucked less - and this result was pretty inevitable.
You say that like the fact he isn't a politician isn't the reason half his voters are voting for him.
The Constitution doesn't require any qualifications to be President. A janitor can run for President. 
We need to get back to the important issues, anyway. Like the best toppings on a hot dog.
We can all start smoking weed with our legal pot.
Party on, Wayne.

Party on, Garth. 
I'm there with you.  Tomorrow, I'll head to my classes, do my school work, and hang out at the bar afterward.  And make DAMN certain to talk about anything other than politics.  Thank God the Blazers are playing tomorrow.
Um, sorry - but no matter who wins, America is forever divided. Trump gave ignorant uneducated people a voice, and that movement is just getting started. *Sadly. 
Those days are over, friend. Social media plus increasingly-polarized media outlets equals an ever dividing country. The fringes get further out there, the middle gets pushed further out too. 

You can't have one side saying that the other is literally Satan and then have all things peaceful afterwards. The price we pay for this rhetoric is violence. 
Just like with Brexit it means theres a disconnect with opinion polls
Maybe, or maybe people thought she had it in the bag and didn't vote. 

The media is a very strong influence. 
The fact that most media had a massive bias against trump didn't help, but mostly it was because people kept their love of Trump more concealed than the Clinton voters. Perhaps better ways of polling public opinion is also in demand now.
Well, on social issues he's no Christian conservative.
Bernie and Elizabeth Warren should have been the ticket.
yup there would have been no wiki leak scandal shit if it was bernie and all the trump shit that came out wouldve hit him harder if he was up against bernie and not hillary
Debbie Wasserman Shultz did that to her own party
Reddit is a hive mind plauged by groupthink and not representative of Americans as a whole.
Kek. I guess Hillary for all her billions is pretty damn unelectable too.
You can't. Clinton and her friends at the DNC are paying the hilt of the consequences for unanimously screwing over Sanders, a candidate which almost every democrat strongly supported. This was the one guy you could relate with in this whole election. 
Doesn't that pretty much apply to Florida 100% of the time though?
What is happening? On the bus and having trouble following results.

Absolutely.  I've had conversations with the Trump voters close to me about Bernie and they all say that they liked him, and admit that this election would have been a lot different if he had run (not sure if that means they would've voted for him instead, but they were mainly voting for Trump because they were anti-establishment and wanted change).  The Democratic establishment was so full of hubris and totally believed they'd have this election in the bag that they ignored the outcry of their own constituents who were literally raging against how unfair the whole caucus process was.  


I would have voted so hard for Sanders.
its the urban vs rural mentality, the urbanites refuse to see any value in the rural areas, it leads to animosity and, well.. this.
You know, they tried that...
Have you ever heard of the Middle East?

Honestly, if not for the whole slavery thing I think that the south winning the civil war wouldn't have been a bad thing.  We're like two nations under one flag, and if not for human bondage it really wouldn't have been bad to let the south fuck themselves over all alone (yes, I'm a Californian liberal)
[deleted]
No doubt. DNC really was crooked and karma is real, I guess.
Bull shit. Democrats will run her 2-3 more times at least. They are just as idiotic as republicans. Dems forced her candidacy and are now gonna get to see the results. 
Probably on her way to somewhere that doesn't extradite.
On a plane to a country with a non-extradition treaty
If she wins, he will be "Mr. President" as he has been since he took office. This never changes for former presidents. However, if he hadn't been president, his title would be "First Gentleman". 
Stick to it man. You're making a better choice than most of the country right now. 
On the other hand, I picked a great day to start drinking heavily.

Doesn't matter, as soon as he takes PA it's finished.
Thats before Clinton fucked it all up for them 
Nah, it already hit... this is watching it scrape along the bulkheads one by one.
Its ok though, cos they will use the minorities as life rafts.
I want off ~~Chip Kelly's~~ Donald Trump's wild ride. 
Looking at the choices on the ballot it's clear we already have. Primaries matter. We learned that the hard way this year. 
We have a huge tradition of DIY attitudes here, as well as a strong anti-government streak and deep religious faith. Throw in an untrustworthy government for a few generations and you get a large portion of the population who'd rather fend for themselves than rely on social programs and don't want to fund them.
I highly suggest the book "What's the Matter with Kansas?" Gives a lot of insight into why the right in America is the way it is. It was written when Bush jr. was president but still holds true today. 
Well the big thing in this election seems to be manufacturing jobs given Wisconsin and Michigan.

Certain states were bastions of manufacturing for a long time, became centers of union activity, and went very blue.  Now that manufacturing is dying, they think Trump's tough-on-trade policy will bring that manufacturing back.

They're probably wrong, those promises will go unfulfilled, and manufacturing as an industry will never return en masse to the United States regardless, which is honestly fine.  At some conceivable point in the future humans should be eliminated from the manufacturing process.

It's really about filling the hole until that happens.

What the "American working class" does for a living varies vastly based on where you are in the country, and some parts are really in the shitter, and some aren't.
Highlight of the entire election right here.
Trump 2016

"For the lolz"
no, we voted bernie but the DNC decided we didnt count. 
Bernie was stolen from the American people and SiLENCED by financial interests heavily invested in the Hill campaign... THERE IS PROOF that the DNC had influence over the Super-Delegates and media organizations in order to disadvantage Bernie. 
Well, not really. Hillary stole the primary from Bernie and that's why this happened in the first place. 
[deleted]
As the FBI intended.
Please send help
Because she aimed all her considerable monetary firepower towards taking out the strong, well-liked dem candidate so she could have her chance.
... in a landslide.

No one under 45 cares about the "socialist" label.

Hell, even quite a few older people don't care about it either.
A Bernie/Trump election would have been able to be called hours ago.
And the DNC only have themselves to blame. They picked the only person less likable than Donald Trump.
Combined with Ohio and North Carolina, yep.
He wins PA, he wins.
Except it may not be. 
American here.. For what it's worth,  a lot of us hate Trump and are, for lack of a better word, horrified at this outcome. 
She bitched out for sure 
nerd
Feel the Johnson!
Ha, ha!
We tried. His own party screwed him.
Democratic voters wanted to... the DNC didn't want him.
He wasn't the anointed one by the DNC.
DNC manipulated it for Clinton. Basically Sanders was fucked from the beginning.
cause of the DNC, that's why.
Dem party basically was gonna have Hillary whether we wanted it or not.

They're kinda eating it right now.
It was out of our hands.
They didnt give us the option. They forced Clinton on us and pissed off a ton of young democrats.
Bernie was viewed as "unelectable" against a typical, establishment Republican candidate.  Whereas Hillary was seen as far more appealing to a general election voter, and thus the DNC put their thumbs on the scale to tip the primaries to her.

Their critical flaw was not understanding that this year, the two biggest questions for a candidate was who was more anti-establishment, and who had more enthusiasm on their side.  They put the most experienced, establishment candidate they had on the ticket, thinking that she would cruise to victory over 99% of Republicans (probably correctly).  Instead, they face Trump with a very motivated base that roasted the establishment with every chance he got, and underestimated just how much rural and rust belt America is hurting.
This is sorta uplifting when you put it that way.
wait the dead gorilla is an option??

shit I fucked up.
Harambe is a fair and just leader
Nucular. It's pronounced nucular.
I still don't understand how hillary beat him... Back when they were going head to head I thought I was going crazy because I was one of the few who preferred Bernie over her.
Possibly even the one we need... not necessarily for sake of his policy points(much of which makes no sense what so ever), but for simply giving the establishment and its candidates a finger.
> I want to be an Author. 

Aim higher. This is a pissing contest, now.
Blame your elders.

Between "Geriatrics for Trump" and "Geriatrics for Clinton", they're a complete group of idiots who have f***ed their kids and grandkids now for the past 3 decades, and continue to do so today.

Only now, when Clinton has serious trouble putting away a carnival clown, can anyone belatedly admit, "hmm, maybe Sanders was easily the better Dem candidate and the kids were right".
Why don't you *comb* over and we can talk about it ;)
But do you have some other animal in the race?  Like a moose or a beaver or something?   I had a porcupine but it got eaten 3 feet into the race.
Doubt it, look at 2000.  :/

But at least we can blaze it here on the west coast... that is if the Republican backed feds don't fuck us over.  :(
Brexit hasn't actually happened yet. It was voted on and passed. It's not done and the economic effects haven't been realized yet. 
> Just like the fear around Brexit causing a global meltdown was overestimated,

To be fair, that's mainly cos it's being kicked into the long grass.
I thought that everyone who didn't vote for the winner would just explode.

I was really hoping I'd explode.
Americans trust in the media is the lowest ever.  We don't listen to them anymore and their constant berating of Trump just came across as pure propaganda.  
Backlash against the media and political class. People honestly dont give a fuck anymore what the media has to say, in fact, they believe the opposite. And why shouldnt they? Everyone has known they are being lied to but couldnt prove it and then wikileaks comes out with definitive proof the DNC is collaborating with networks. The harder the media tried to crush Trump, the more people resisted it. 
It's blowback from PC culture, and Trump is a political outsider and a nationalist.
Is it possible that peoples' distrust of the media has caused the misrepresentation of polls?
It's honestly the demo parties fault for putting Clinton up
This election was lost the moment Sarah Silverman stood on that stage and said the Sanders supporters were "being ridiculous"
Shame the Democrat who could have capitalized on that got sunk in the Primaries.
The people tried to tell them. But the people at the top of the DNC thought they could ignore us and impose their own political wills using their normal antics. They shot themselves in the foot on this one. Even better than Bernie though, I really wish Elizabeth Warren got the DNC nomination.
Pretty much they chose the worse candidate possible 
Brexit was same situation. 

Also, the Clinton Campaign made it a strategic point to have the media especially CNN elevate Trump during the primaries to make sure he was the GOP nominee because they didn't stand a chance against anyone else in their view.
the south shall rise again!
Not China their economy is starting to fall because of Trump.
God that would be the best end to this election . And I'm canadian
He grabbed the elections right by the pussy. 
Minutes after her campaign manager (is that right?) told the crowd of her supporters, who had been faithfully waiting for hours, that it wasn't over yet and that they should go home to bed. I think that pretty well exemplifies the trust issues many people have with her. 

Edit: Actually, I never gave much credence to the rumors that she may be an alcoholic, and appears to imbibe a bit too much in private, but that would be a very reasonable explanation for blowing off her supporters last night, especially after how the night went down for her.
He's winning because people instinctively rebel when they feel that the entire establishment of the rich and powerful are trying to ram the other candidate down their throats. 
And we'll get the Mexicans to pay for it all!
[deleted]
Agreed. I don't agree with everything Trump says or does but I can't agree with pepole who are intolerant of other's right to have their own political beliefs. 
When you accuse people of being bigot or shove YOUR beliefs down their throats it is a huge turn off.
Or maybe the twitter echochamber was always wrong on that part of Trumps beliefs? 
let me be clear, I cant stand Trump for an absurd amount of reasons; however, this is one thing i believe him.  I dont think he is anti gay at all, actually he might be a good friend to the gay community.  We all forget that Trump was a pretty staunch democrat until 2008ish? he just seized an opportunity.  I am becoming slightly more optimistic the more i think this through, but then again I could be completely wrong and he makes us an 18th century society again, in which case thank God im white and a man.
It's just a prank bro.

Because Florida... 
This is great news!   Everything is on sale.  Then, once everyone realizes nothing will change, because it never does, it will pop back up by those like us who see an opportunity and start buying.  Give it a day or 2 to clear out.
It's kind of a fucked system, but it's also got its merits. 

It's mostly based on population. But each state is guaranteed 2 votes plus 1. Two for being a member of the country and 1 because population always counts for 1 vote. 

This is to give states like Wyoming that have very little in terms of population a voice in national elections. 

As for why not a straight popular vote? The electoral college is enshrined in our Constitution, so it would take a huge effort to abolish it. It was established because at the time counting a huge number of votes would be difficult at best, so it was broken down to reflect voting in Congress. 

Edit: DC gets 3 votes because Wyoming (least populous state) gets 3 votes. So there's 538 electoral votes but only 535 seats in Congress. 
Most don't realize the DNC fucked the democratic ticket. This coming from a libertarian. Would have voted Bernie, they sabotaged themselves with a candidate that got rekt in 2008, and had to sabotage a socialist 70 year old to get the nomination in 2016. The hell did they expect to happen?
Clinton supporters have been blaming everything but their candidate for months now for literally anything and everything.  Of course they'll blame the guy polling 2% even though he probably got more republicans
Are we canceled
The most compelling reason for voting I've heard so far, is the empty supreme court seat.
Remember when we used to laugh at *Doomsday Preppers*? 
I am, and there are a few of us around.
corruption mostly from what I can tell
She cheated. See Wikileaks.
I think that's an over simplification. States have early voting that is open on weekends. If you can't get to the polls you can get an absentee ballot. If you're over 65 you can mail.your ballot in. Many states have organizations in place to drive people to the polls. Employers are required to allow people to take time off to vote on election day. You can get an ID for free in states that require picture id. Yes there are exceptions but it's not as universally bad as you seem to think.
Your points are pretty contradictory in nature.  Election fraud in the US is nearly unheard of, it's basically something everyone screams about but .000000001% of voting practices are even remotely questionable.

For example you state:

> not enough protections against voter impersonation

> like questionable ID requirements

These are mutually exclusive.  If you think the first is a problem (hint: it's not) then you'll want the second.  But the second is actually what is used to keep lower social status voters from making the attempt, so your concerns are not logical there.

I for one think voting is a civic *duty*.  That means you take time out of your day and vote.  Period.  You can vote early if this is too difficult, but absolutely everyone no matter how poor can vote if it's important to them.  If you live in a remote location or have difficulties with the language that's on you to figure out as your duty to the nation.  The nation owes you a relatively nearby (within reason - and truly most are) well-staffed safe polling location free from harassment.  

That's about it - the rest is on you.  If you're that lazy/irresponsible/busy to make it someone else's problem, I don't think you're mature enough to be participating in the democracy to begin with.  I was able to get to the polls when I was making minimum wage working two full time jobs without a car; absolutely anyone can do it if it's remotely a priority to you.

A lot of the "holy shit" stuff you likely read earlier this year were primaries - and those have absolutely nothing to do with government.  Think of those as a group of your friends deciding who between them they want to run for president - and using whatever rules you damn well please to do so.

difficulty of voting is entirely dependent on the state. my state for instance has a mail in ballot so voting is actually extremely easy and being on a weekday really doesn't matter in the slightest as I put my vote in a week ago.

and no the UN can fuck off. we already have a separate system in place to observe the election process.
Make FarSightXR-20 Great Again!
He's as legitimate a candidate as Donald Trump.
No! This is actually the worst case scenario!  A tie would drag this into the courts for the next month or more and the coverage would be worse than it's been all year. 
Yep a race of unpopularity
Come on man. 1% of the precincts are in, that's as good as 100
Bernie was the one DNC candidate projected to beat Trump. Bernie, not Hillary. Backstabbers got served. Hopefully he'll survive till 2020.

Trump in a landslide.
Ha
At this rate just make it indefinitely.
We'll make America pay for it. 
Wait really?? Are all 3 branches of government really Republican ruled under Trump Presidency? I know the executive and legislative but I didn't check the judicial. 
this has always made me very angry. scotus is supposed to be about the law, the constitution, and legal precident. not an individuals beliefs or political leanings or agenda  
She has more blame on herself than anyone else. She was handed the presidency on a silver platter and managed to fuck it up
Correction to the above:

there are 2 qualifications, being a natural-born Citizen, and being over a certain age (I believe it's 36 y.o or above)
All these states voting on legal weed, and all I get is a fucking [transit bond referendum](http://www.waketransit.com/).
Dude, they're playing tonight too!! Woohoo!!!
I have been ignoring so many phone calls over the last month because I know they are all pollsters.  It made me wonder who the demographic is that answers those phone calls.
That gives me hope but then I remember that asshole Mike Pence is his Vice President
On social issues he doesn't give two shits either way. He'll sign whatever bill the Republican Congress puts in front of him.
Right, how Hillary got it, I will never understand.
And Bingo was his name-o!
48.5 to 48.5, with 60℅ reporting!

I'm so fucking anxious!
It's within 10k votes of eachother.
In both cases the media straight up lied about what was going on in an attempt to make their preferred outcome happen. Which is exactly the sort of behavior that contributed to both outcomes being possible in the first place. Lesson to the media: Stop lying. Play it straight.
Yeah fuck Lincoln! 
Well at least the Democrats will be done with the Clintons hopefully. 
I disagree. There's no way they run someone who lost against Donald Trump. Huge embarrassment for the party. She's also not getting any younger.
So if you're running around the White House looking for "president Clinton" people would actually have to ask "which one?"?
They are going to feel the consequences now, maybe they'll understand now what they did.
He wins regardless, Hillary would have to clean sweep almost every grey to win, and it's not happening.
Same goes for 1/2 of the UK r.e Brexit 
Votes out for Harambe!
DNC collusion is how she won

Shitty reality
The supreme Court is currently vacant one seat so it sits tied 4-4, Obama attempted to fill the vacancy but the Republicans blocked it. Now with a Republican present and a Republican controlled senate they will put a Republican on the bench making it 5-4, giving Republican complete controll of the federal government. 
And it's the Suns, should be a nice W for us!  Rip City!
Because she was in a primary against an opponent who's a longstanding *independent* - he caucused with Democrats, but he *wasn't* a member of the party.  Of course the Democratic establishment preferred her to him, so of course they worked toward that.

I much preferred Sanders, but that Hillary had support - both official and unofficial - from the democratic party establishment shouldn't be a surprise.  The only surprise there was how willing they were to do it all under the table instead of coming right out and saying: "It's a Democrat vs an Independent-who-leans-Democrat seeking the Democratic nomination; we prefer her."

Edited for clarity.
People love their royal families!
