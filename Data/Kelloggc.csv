And, as always happens with brand purchases like this, they will lower the production costs as much as possible, slash quality, and ride out the name as long as they can until everyone knows they're gross now and doesn't buy them anymore.
> In November, Kellogg said it plans to reorganize its North America team and invest in e-commerce to drive growth.

Yes!  Finally!  I've been waiting patiently to be able to go to Kellogg's web site to pay full retail price plus shipping for their products and not actually get them until a week later, instead of getting them for a slightly lower price when I'm already at the supermarket doing the rest of my shopping.
They owned Girlscout Cookies?
Good. Maybe Keebler will actually be a good product again. Back in the day their E.L. Fudge and similar cookies were amazing, then they changed something and they all suck now.

&#x200B;

They better not dare touch Famous Amos though. Those miniature pucks of crack are fine as they are.
Definitely thought this was an April Fool's Joke...
Famous Amos are the tits. They're really not good cookies, but I inhale a bag in minutes
God Damn it, it’s been suggested thousands of times, Oatmeal, no raisins.
The cookie business is dog eat dog. I should know, I was there when Frankie Oreo shot Johnny Hydrox in broad daylight. 
So, Kellogg's tossed its cookies.
Well that's not happy or fun.
:( I love Famos Amos. I feel bad for the creator thou, I believe he really got screwed in the original deal.
>Keebler

So Jeff Sessions is now unemployed?
every time i try to get out of the cookie game, they pull me back in
So what will Jeff do now?
Damn GDPR, ruining Kellogg's product portfolio.
Ferrero is less interested in the brands - they are looking for distribution channels and access to the market for their own products in Europe.
But what are they getting into now? *trouble, pure trouble* evil cookies
My mom use to buy famous amos when I was growing up and I remember them being great. Bought a bag last month and I nearly chipped a tooth biting into it. Tasted like sawdust. Keebler still taste okay to me, I mostly still buy the pie shells.
What I love about this genius move, Kellogg bought Keebler back in 2000 for $3.8 billion; now they're letting Keebler , Famous Amos, Mother's and other brands they purchased go for around $2.5 billion less than what they paid for Keebler alone.  Now I do not have an MBA, but this does not seem like a good way to do business if you plan on staying viable. What is this, a garage/yard sale?
> Last year, the businesses Kellogg is selling to Ferrero brought in about $900 million in sales but only $75 million in operating profit. 

Meanwhile lyft *lost* 900 million and they went public with great fanfare.
kellogg gets their cookies off
Famous Amos = overrated AF
Girl Scout Cookies too?!?  

It better be a good trade. Don't want samoas ruined. 
Pepperidge farm remembers.
Bryers is gross those who know blue bell know its king even with the whole listeria its the one icecream brand worth dying over also since ferrero owns all the cookie brands that kellogs had maybe we get a ferrero rocher girls scout cookie
I hope for no changes to Famous Amos cookies.

Don't fix what's 10/10.
Well Cookie Monster could care less as long as he gets his cookies.
The first time I ever heard of Famous Amos was [the Latka's Cookies episode of Taxi.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9in32B34dK8)
They gonna regret that when weed is legal everywhere lol
[deleted]
Can these products get any worse? Yes! Says capitalism!
RIP Breyers
This happened many, many years ago with Keebler and Famous Amos.
To be faaaaair, that's already what Keebler cookies are today. 
Ferrero makes expensive products. I think this is more likely an attempt to capture part of the affluent market that can afford to spend money on premium snack items, the nutella and la croix consuming folk. That's the economic trend with these kinds of acquisitions.

Keebler are shit-tier cookies, but they're on grocery store shelves everywhere which means people are still buying them. It's a cheap way for a European company that has the capacity to purchase a lot of shelf space in grocery stores across America.

Wouldn't be surprised to see premium(ish) products being introduced under the keebler name alongside popular keebler products.
I don’t think so.  Ferrero , the company that bought them has actively invested over $4.0B in other companies, like Ferrara Candy and Nestle’s candy brands.  Since doing so they have actually IMPROVED the quality of some classics like Butterfinger.  Their own legacy brands tend to be high quality (Ferrero Rocher, Kinder, Nutella).  

Their concern is NOT bottom line profits.  Their goal is expansion and market share.  You don’t do that by cheapening a product.  
You mean like this?

http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_31971893/conagara-pinnacle-boulder-brands

Sure, but I'm in this for the cereal. 
So long as they don't change the recipe.
Dang, I love Famous Amos cookies.
In this case I have to disagree. The brand name Keebler is being shared by Ferrera and Kellogg's. Kellogg's will still manufacture Keebler crackers. So there will be contractual agreements on what if any changes can be made to existing products. Also, Ferrera seems to be looking to take a stronghold in the American market. I don't see this as a quick cash grab.
RIP Oreos 
Who are the "geniuses" are Kellogg making these decisions? 
Pffft, "websites". I'm getting my Frosted Flakes from the blockchain. On the cloud.
*Edit:* TIL This is wrong, see comments below.

No, Girlscout Cookies are made by ABC Bakers (subsidiary of Interbake Foods, George Weston Limited).
Famous Amos is already ruined as far as fucking up the original recipe. Wally Amos is supposedly working on bringing his real recipe back but last I checked they weren’t available to order.
Typically when large corporations sell subsidiaries they are sold to mom and pop type people who bring the quality up while driving down the prices. Definitely won't be sold to an investment firm that will gut the companies and load them up with debt while destroying any remaining quality that was left.

...

...

April Fools!
The mini chocolate chip ones in the tub from Trader Joe’s are better. 
Nutella Keebler cookies incoming
My entire development team is fueled by Famous Amos. We clear out a vending machines worth a day.
> then they changed something and they all suck now.

Want to know what really happened?

You got older.  Your tastes change.  The things you liked before aren't as good.  Welcome to adulthood.
Nah, they're still amazing. More likely you're taste buds changed. I love E.L. Fudge just as much today as I did 20 years ago.
perhaps more calorie conscious?

i mean, when cookies are 100 calories each and its two for serving size, that's pretty bad

you eat the whole bag you've literally gained a pound
Fuck you, they’re delicious cookies and I inhale a bag in seconds!
Seriously there is something about them that just makes you devour the damn bag.
*You leave the raisins outta this you souless bastard* Oatmeal raisin will reign supreme!
WalMart's Great Value has those
And now the girl scouts run a protection racket.
I was there too, dark day it was, I hear the Walker family paid off the cops too! 
They can toss their cookies all over me 🤮😤👌👌
You should never come to /r/news expecting either of those things. 
He's been unemployed
Maybe that shows what they feel the business is worth given the attempt of people to eat healthier. Yes, it’s a loss, but maybe less of a loss than if they try to keep it going. If the business was worth more they likely wouldn’t sell or would try to sell for a higher price.
I mean, $75M ain’t bad. 
they were good 20 years ago
they should bring back those commercials
you seriously never liked these:  ??

Let’s be honest, it’s not as if Kellogg’s a bastion of small independent business that puts quality over profit maximization.
Bryers frozen dessert. It's not even ice cream anymore.
Agreed. Used to be quality and simple ingredients but now chock full of crap.  Surprised Haagen-Daaz hasn’t compromised (minus the non-pint sizing). 
Hey no kidding. Breyers used to be the stuff, now it's not. I guess I never thought about it.
It’s not even labeled as ice cream some places, just frozen dairy desert. So much water in it 
Rip ripon cookies
Breyers still has quality ingredients. 

Their list of ingredients is like 5 things- milk, cream, sugar, vegetable gum, and flavorings.


On the other hand most other ice cream isn't even real ice cream, it's propylene glycol and crap like that. 
You're not wrong, but I've never seen a brand trade off actually *increace* the quality of the product in question 
Yes, this.  They have been making very large and systematic investments in US brands to gain share of US grocery shelves.  Their focus is indulgent snacks and treats: candy, baking, cookies, dessert spreads/nut butters.  

I cant share actual numbers, but I know that in addition to buying new brands, they are spending an insane amount of money in advertising as well.  

Ferrero has the long run in sight, and are happily losing money now to build a strong business in the future.  I believe their core belief is that quality products and good branding win in the long run.  At least that’s what their actions suggest.
Nutella and La Croix are expensive?
Dude the new butterfinger is not good, ingredients wise maybe? But not in taste. You're right sometimes a new owner will try to maintain the brand at least, but usually the 'new improved recipe' tastes like crap
That's Nabisco, the parent company is Mondelez International.
Have they changed? I guess I don't notice because I only used to eat the chocolate filled ones, but they still taste exactly the same. 
The new innovative CEO that was hired but will be let go in 2 years after horrible performance. He’ll already have made horrible decisions that costed the company millions of dollars and ruined their brand in the process. 
They're also made by Little Brownie Bakers, who is a division of Keebler.
They were available. He pitched them on shark tank a couple years ago. I’ve always considered ordering but the shipping makes it very expensive since he has to send it from hawaii. I just checked and it appears his store is down. Never seen it down before: https://www.cookiekahuna.com/collections/order-online 
We already know it’s being sold to Ferrero though...
Gonna have to give those a try. I love anything Trader Joe's, and just got introduced to their organic mini cheese sandwich crackers. Basically like the Ritz ones, but 1000% times more amazing. I have no doubts when it comes to their quality.
I wanna say GFY, but you're absolutely right. I ate a Twinkie the other day, for the first time in 30 years, and it was absolute garbage. 
99% of Kellogg's products are sugar-laden nastiness. I bought a box of Raisin Bran recently...there is so much damn sugar covering everything...just why? A bowl of Famous Amos cookies for breakfast would likely be healthier.
If you're worried about calories, you probably shouldn't be eating carbs loaded with sweeteners.

And if you ignore the serving size and eat the whole fucking bag, the problem is that you have poor impulse control.
Some people want to reduce oatmeal raisin cookies to just a lump of oatmeal. Molon labe motherfuckers!
oatmeal raisin is the fruitcake of cookies. dried, nasty ass pieces of fruit.  you're welcome to them! just don't push that on other people. its like trying to push durian fruit. only certain people like dried fruit in their sweets.
skeet skeet!
That was his side hustle. Cookies pay the bills.
Well clearly, they've squeezed all the value out of the brands that they care too and are ready to profit off of some other garbage.

EDIT: Also I'm clearly implying that the products are already pretty shitty.
HEB master race for the win.  I love living in Texas for the win, I haven't had anything other than HEB Creamy Creations and Central Market Small Batch ice cream in over a decade, except for the odd Blue Bell.
It wasn't ice cream before either, they just changed the rules on labeling. 
RIP Butterfinger
is this recent? i though breyers was pretty watered down for years now

i love that hagen though, the complete opposite
Back in the 90's Breyer's had that TV ad that totally sold me on that ice cream. Wow, four ingredients...sign me up!
My new go to ice cream is Stone Ridge. Its super soft and it tastes sooooo good. I haven't actually checked if it's real but my god is it good.
I don’t think those exist anymore. The company went bankrupt and nobody continued the brand. I sure as hell wish their wafer cookies were still around.
Only in a couple flavors. The rest are 'dairy dessert' mixtures of all kinds of stuff. (Which, IMO, tastes fine, but is always more expensive than a local brand, so I don't buy it).
I was gonna say this. Plus, this is the only brand I have found that simply adds the lactose enzyme to the regular formula for those of us who are lactose intolerant. I tried all the non dairy ones and they are all crap. Breyers is brilliant for this and I wish they would do it for more flavors but I understand it. 
That’s your opinion.  Given the size and maturity of that company, and their very well funded marketing department, I bet they did a lot of research, and most people disagree with you.  

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have changed it.  After already spending a pile of money on research and development, they then have to spend a pile more to make the change: retooling machinery, retraining employees, new packaging artwork and materials, new printing plates or cylinders, new raw materials sourcing, and lastly but most painful of all: a new UPC code, which translates (most likely) into slotting fees at retailers and destruction of previous gen product.

Unless a company saves a butt load of money on COGS (which I don’t think they did here with more premium and quality ingredients), the only reason any rationale person would make the change is if you were confident it was better to most people who would buy it...and in time they would buy more of it.
which school do these CEOs get their MBAs from? I think most CEOs  in modern day America get their job based on who they know and not their previous work and education. I could be wrong.
You left out the part where he gets a 30 million dollar severance package on the way out the door
Oh don't forget they'll leave with a multi-million dollar severance package
Interesting. I wonder if that's a regional thing, or certain flavors.   
The cookies we have sitting around were all made by ABC.
Don't know how good the original Amos cookies were but if I'm ordering cookies from Hawaii, I go with School Kine cookies. The shortbread nibbles are addicting.
Chocolate mint stars at Xmas. My kid took them for snack and had kids buzzing around her table. 
They shrank twinkies a few years ago tbf 
ok but twinkies are a different story. People talk about 3D printing food and I like to half joke that we’ve been doing that with twinkies
Twinkies are made by a different company now with different ingredients at different facilities. They are super gross. how did they manage to make a crap product so much worse?
> A bowl of Famous Amos cookies for breakfast would likely be healthier.

Well now I know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow.
I noticed all the freaking sugar on that cereal as well.  They used to label that has a more "healthy" breakfast than the other more sugary cereals.  You can't get more sugary than what they put in Rasin Bran.   Like you said, except I'd say butterfingers in milk would be just as sugary, add a small pinch of dietary fiber and BAM new "nutritious" cereal. 
Raisins are absolutely loaded with sugar by themselves.
Dude, it's **Raisin** Bran. Of course it's loaded with sugar. Raisins are ridiculously sugar dense.
You're not one of those low carb nuts are you? 
Dried oatmeal cookies are terrible. Moist, squishy, molassesy oatmeal raisin cookies are amazing. 
You don't have to eat them, grab a chocolate chip instead.

Plain oatmeal cookies are just that.  Plain.  Gimme some added flavor.
Ha! HEB Master race got me a chuckling dawg. Huge fan- also rep hard fresh thyme aka gangster paradise 
I miss the Adam's Best though that they had for a while. That stuff beat the pants off Blue Bell and Creamy Creations both. 
Huh? Butterfinger was recently sold off from Nestle to Ferrero and they are better now. The old ones tasted like chocolate covered cardboard.
No, not terribly recent.  Sold to Unilever in 1993 or so, changed the recipe in 2006 or so.  Vanilla bean ice cream used to have like four ingredients in it.  Now it's some monstrosity that tastes like butt.

I think they offer "natural vanilla" now that is similar, but the rest of the product line is still pretty much garbage.
Oh it’s disgusting now.  Go buy a bin of breyers and leave it out until it’s room temp.  It’ll still be scoopable.  It’s basically milk and dozens of thickeners and binders and it tastes like shit
I swear Ben and Jerry's changed after they sold out. Hagen is still gold tho.
Lots of old Breyer's ads but here's a good one

https://youtu.be/d4hXZVgANXM

and my fav

https://youtu.be/qWl0XDEYoxU


...which flavors, out of curiosity
I haven’t seen this or known to look for it. What is the line called and what kind of flavors are good in it?
Thanks! My husband actually likes coconut ice cream but it’s expensive. Just bought some of the breyers lactose free vanilla hoping we could both enjoy it. 
Digorno learned this lesson the hard way a few years ago.   They changed their sauce back after sales dropped hard. 
You can lower the quality of the ingredients without changing the recipe 
They're also fed a bunch of bullshit by marketers.
Yes, it's entire regional. I do not believe there's any difference in cookie offerings anymore, but people do swear they can taste the difference between the two. I haven't done a side by side myself to comment. The two-bakeries is also why some people call them "somoas" and others call them "caramel delights" 
Regional but also mixed. It's a patchwork of the two suppliers over the individual councils. It's based on shipping and sale date variations I think. It's not strictly location based as I've lived in several states and seen both bakeries in all of them.

 There's some size and recipe variations between the two bakers too. ABC calls the chocolate peanut butter cookies Peanut Butter Patties, Little Brownie calls them Tagalongs. Same with Carmel Delights and Somoas

Each council gets to choose who to order from, but those are the only two licensed bakers.
It's called Cookie Crisp and its fucking delicious 
Yeah, I know that, but there is so much added sugar dumped on top of both the raisins and the bran flakes. They take what could be reasonably healthy cereal and turn it into basically poison.
huh! never had one of those. I can see that being possible. upvote earned.
The worst is when you grab a chocolate chip that turns out to be oatmeal raisin...
TIL you can't get that anymore. I've not been letting myself buy as much ice cream as I used to but that one quickly became a go-to when I was feeling the urge. Damn. :(
I work for nestle. We sold to ferrarro but we still make all the candy and distribute it for at least the rest of 2019. So its the same chocolate card board as it was in 2017. When huge brands sell they typically remain manufactured by the original company for a while. For instance when nestle bought juicy juice and then sold juicy juice ocean spray was making it for both companies
I can't stand the new recipe.  I guess i'm a fan of chocolate covered cardboard.
What?!? They tasted like peanut butter. I know because I am a confessed peanutbutterholic. I don't like cardboard. I am not a cardboardaholic!
The new ones are disgusting. Go on twitter and see what the public has to say. 
Came for the breyer's vanilla ice cream comment. you delivered. 
Brings me back. Cheers.
In canada it's mostly black box = ice cream, blue box = frozen dessert, but it looks like it's intentionally confusing in the states.
Its Breyers, regular packing, in red letter it will say "lactose free". I have only found vanilla and chocolate. Breyers does have a lot of options now, so sometimes I have to look pretty hard to find these. 
They made the sauce sweet, it was gross.
Are you sure you're not just getting really, really old butterfingers-like eat by date 1999?
Yes, but what does that have to do with anything here?  They already did change the recipe (and ingredients/proportions), and were upfront about what changed.  All were quality increases, which, frankly, reversed 20 years of the brand being cheapened by others.
I grew up selling: Caramel Delights, Short Breads, Peanut Butter Patties, Peanut Butter Sandwiches, and Thin Mints.

I am now living in a different part of the country and I buy: Samoas, Trefoils, Tagalongs, Dosidos, and Thin Mints.

They seem to taste the same to me.
There are differences. 
Having done cookie\\cracker baking before.  The exact same recipe can taste different depending on what region it is cooked in.  Water has a lot to do with it, so does humidity, and the source of the flour they use to bake it with.  

&#x200B;

A Bigmac in Japan will also taste slightly different than a Bigmac in Saint Louis.  
I’ve done taste tests of somoas and caramel delights. Caramel delights are crap.
And there’s definite taste differences. 
I soak my raisins in rum before adding to my oatmeal cookies.
It's like biting into a booger. (I assume.)
How are you on half-oatmeal pecan chocolate chip cookies?  My mom goes kind of half and half between normal and oatmeal in texture, crispy and chewy at the same time, hot damn they're good.
For real. It was the best ice cream I'd had in a while. 
Ditto! The new bars are like chewing straight peanut butter. No snap. I can just go dip a spoon now. Done. 
>i'm a fan of chocolate covered cardboard.

It's a bad idea to tell people you love in Cleveland, it will help people dox you.
Isn’t Twitter just a pressure-release valve for impotent rage?
Going on twitter to see what the public has to say is the exact opposite of getting reliable information..
Haha. Maybe my tastes for candy have just changed, because I thought they were pretty bad in the last 10 years or so ..just so dry, bleh.
Thanks so much. I’ll check it out. 
Nah I got the 'new and improved' one to try cause Kroger was giving them away for free, not a fan.
So, I decided to do a bit o'research http://graphics.latimes.com/girl-scout-cookies/

Seems the thinmints are pretty freaking different, looks like the samoas are also. I demand a re-count!
Ha! There were no caramel anythings when I sold them. We had chocolate and Vanilla creams and there were these cookies that were shaped like a flower and were chocolate and a fudge center. Thin Mints were made. Vanilla cookie base with a chocolate glaze. Also they changed Scot Teas. Used to have sugar spinkled on the top. Were much better back then.  And peanut butter sandwich cookies. Just pure pb cookies with pb filling.
Royale with Cheese
I actually love homemade oatmeal cookies!  Even oatmeal raisin, but I hate the packaged/store bought oatmeal raisin cookies and really most packaged oatmeal cookies. 

Those sound delicious.
This was both unfunny and nonsense!
Wow, I've never seen such a succinctly-put comment describe Twitter so perfectly, lol.
It is. I've bought a couple butterfingers in the last few days. They really do taste better. 

They used to be my absolute favorite candybar when I was a kid and over the years you could tell they were getting shittier. Think I'll grab another on the way home now lol.
Yup but you can use it as a tool 
I got on twitter back in 2010 because of Arab Spring. It certainly is a tool that can be used to gather information you wont be seeing on BBC. 
yeah...they may LOOK a little different, but to my pleb taste buds, they are pretty similar.
ELI5 the reference and why it’s getting a ton of downvotes?
> succinctly-put comment describe Twitter so perfectly, lol.

He's had tons of practice on Twitter.

yes, to find new and exciting ways for people to be upset about things

if you want to know general consensus though, not really
But, as a tool against a new company that decided to use higher quality ingredients to save a brand of candy that was losing money likely due to low quality ingredients?  Seems kind of impotent ragey.
I think they’re trying to say that Cleveland has a homeless problem, and the “chocolate on cardboard” would be a black person sleeping on a box. That’s just a guess, though, since I’ve never heard anyone refer to it that way. 

As for the downvotes? Vote momentum on a high traffic post. Next time you’re really browsing comments for a while, any time you click the downvote button ask yourself: did that really deserve a downvote or did I do that because the score was already negative? It may shock you how often the second thing is the answer. It certainly shocks me, since even knowing about the phenomenon of vote momentum doesn’t seem to help me avoid falling into the pattern.
Huh. TIL Frosted Flakes are called Frosties outside the US. 
edit: and outside Canada. 
[deleted]
I remember when this cereal was advertised during Saturday morning cartoons. That was awhile ago, but if bet it still is. I'm too old to get up that early on a Saturday to confirm.
What's asinine is that the subjective distinction between "kids cereal" and "adult cereal" means the difference in your taxes. I don't blame them for checking the other box on their forms.
Can confirm, am adult, eat frosted flakes. And cinnamon toast crunch. And fruit loops. I like cereal
Any cereal with a cartoon character on it, is targeted at kids. Regardless of if adults eat it.
Frosties are just cornflakes for people who can't face reality
Remove the cartoon, put that in a brown box on the top shelf (adult eye height) and see if it effects sales one way or the other. 
Well if you look at the numbers, it is overwhelmingly purchased by adults, not kids.
[deleted]
Some of their ads target the adult demo. 

https://youtu.be/xRBsU5PfL8c (NSFW)
Why not just not buy this for your kid?
They're grrrrreat at finding tax loopholes!
Well that's just grrreeeeeaaatt.
This sounds like a Nathan For You episode
Why do we have to create these silly tax cut outs? 
As far as I'm concerned, some of the most egregious examples of corporate evil can be found in or around the sugar industry.

[For several decades, the sugar industry used bribery and misleading "science" reports to shift negative attention away from sugar in regards to heart health and obesity.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html)  For years and years, these companies jeopardized the health of countless Americans, especially children, in order to maximize revenues and appease their shareholders.

One of the big reasons why America is so fat is because of the sugar industry's lies.

Here's the thing: now the truth is out there, now that everybody knows that an excessive amount of sugar is bad for you, people still want to eat it every day.  Sugar is delicious and addictive.  Everybody is happy when they drink a soda, eat a donut, or chow down on a bowl of Frosted Flakes, whereas I get angry just thinking about eating a salad as an entree.  And a disturbing amount of the food we get at the grocery store - including things that we think are healthy, like nutrition bars and salad dressing - is loaded with it, thanks to things like corn syrup. 

The sugar industry did not need to lie in order to be extremely profitable; they already seem to have a stranglehold on American foods.  But they lied anyway in order to become even more ludicrously profitable.  

If you want to see out-of-control greed causing long-lasting damage to an entire society, all you have to do is look at sugar.
My kid wouldn't touch it. No marshmallows.  :(

ITT:  A whole bunch of people who didn't bother to read the article.

Here's the full "weasely" quote:

> Tam Fry, spokesman at the National Obesity Forum, said: "Frosties is a Kellogg's classic and they won't want to do anything about that.  At first glance making them an adult cereal appears to be a way of getting round the regulations.

> "It is a bit weasley. **But as long as they make the generous concessions to health across the range they should be allowed to keep their classic products. With Frosties if you get rid of the sugar, then you get rid of the product.**"

And here's a quote from someone literally with a group called "Action on Sugar":

> Jenny Rosborough, campaign manager at Action on Sugar, said: “I am not convinced that Tony the Tiger doesn't appeal to children. Frosties is a very popular cereal, and while Kellogg's claims it is now not aiming it at children, children will still eat it.  

> **"However we are encouraged by Kellogg's overall sugar reduction plans and the recent changes they've made** and would now like to see this ambition rolled out across their whole portfolio of cereals. It is crucial that manufacturers take responsibility for the nutritional quality of cereals they're selling and how they market them, particularly to children." 

These are quotes from people who should be the most outspoken critics if there were anything to criticize. 
 But there's not.  Kellogg's own research shows that just 1 in 5 people eating the product are kids.  I know capitalist hating reddit will never believe that info, but here's the rest:

> In a major bid to reduce sugar across the rest of its range Kellogg's is to cut the amount of sugar in its three top selling children's cereals by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent by mid-2018.

> Coco Pops, Rice Krispies, and Rice Krispies Multi-Grain Shapes will all see reductions. 

So, Kellogg's is doing something good that we should be applauding.  But, of course, what we get on reddit is bullshit instead.
How about stop punishing adults who have the right to buy whatever they want by making what they want to buy more expensive and teach parents how to keep their kids healthy instead? 

Oh right, because that involves effort. 
I'm an adult and I eat it. They're not lying.
>Kellogg's has been accused of a "weasly" attempt to get around child obesity sugar rules after re-branding Frosties as an adult cereal. 

Is that called, having lawyers?

Hey I get it. And hate when, we try to make a perfectly good law(not judging this one) and corps find a stupid way around it. Like political pacs abusing the charity designation in order to keep donors secret and have better tax rates.

But, "weasly" is just code for your lawyer doing the job you paid him to do. We have an adversarial system. And its actually made better when lawyers do this, as we can see and close the holes. Life doesnt work on the "honor code" if their is a cheat in a game, people will use it.

Should they get away with this? hell no. But the fault isnt with kellogg, its the badly written law, with "bugs" that allow people to go around its intent. having a professional on payroll look for those bugs is not a problem, in fact, its what all corps SHOULD do. (that said, often holes are on purpose or when found, never filled, still i say the fact corps look for the holes isnt the problem and isnt preventable. Its human nature... the fact our politicians cant design a proper law.. is) What are they going to do, ask their lawyer to do his job but for moral reasons dont do it too well.

I think the concept of these types of laws are stupid. People should be responsible enough to not eat all the wrong types of food all the time, the government shouldn’t be forcing companies to change how they make the food they make just to try and keep people from eating bad. 
How about you just get rid of the sugar tax?
Next year you'll have to show ID to prove you're over 18 to receive a box of frosties which are now kept behind the counter locked in a cabinet with a shutter to hide them from view.
Am adult: check

Eat Frosties: check

I don't see a problem here.
They should just change it to a real tiger and buy the copyright for "put a tiger in your tank"
Great, now we're going to get carded buying cereal now?
Just shape the Frosties like little phalluses, and there you go...

I’m seeing a common theme in their advertising. 
Same calories as Special K.
I'm an adult and it's my cereal . 
I'm glad, frosted flakes are f**n delicious 
A sugar tax on kids items?This is the real travesty
I can just hear that meeting now: ‘did you know that over 80% of customers that buy our product are over 25 years old?’ 
Do I need to show my ID next time I’m at Walmart buying Frosties?
Which kid?
Regardless of who it's marketed to, it's up to the adult to make proper dietary decisions for their children.    
They're Grrrreat!*

*For the manufacturers of insulin.

Actually, I love Frosted Flakes.  I'll eat them as a snack without milk more often than as breakfast cereal.
What?  A company is finding a loophole in order to dodge a tax??   

Say it ain’t so!

Maybe they should charge more for them and make the boxes smaller....   again 
I'm an adult, I eat that shit like it is the last available food on Earth. Seems fair to me. 
*insert joke about Tony the Tiger and Furries*
Did they re-brand Frosted Flakes? WTF are Frosties? edit: oh. british variant. carry on.
Why not just have a flat tax on all sugar and sugar-like substances that can be manufactured at a similar cost?
the name in latin america is Zucaritas .  Which is like little sugars? 
I wikipediaed this and found out they are called:

>Frosted Flakes (U.S. and Canada)

>Frosties (UK, AU, most Commonwealth nations and European and Middle East countries; formerly Frostis in Spain)

>Zucaritas in Hispanic America (the word roughly translates as "Sugaries")

>Sucrilhos in Brazil (also roughly translates as "Sugaries")

>Corn Frosty (コーンフロスティ) in Japan

>Corn Frost (Korean: 콘푸로스트) in South Korea

TIL Frosties are called Frosted flakes in the us.
I have lived in Canada my whole life, and the name was always Frosted Flakes.
It's Frosted Flakes in Canada as well
Is so weird looking at a box of Frosted Flakes and it just doesn’t say Frosted Flakes. 
Frosted Flakes would be the store brand name here.
HAHA yeah at first look I thought "what the hell are frosties and why is Tony the tiger on the box". 
They'll then claim it's not a cereal. 
Because the bill is based on "Think of the Children" not "Think of how this could reduce strain on the NHS"

Edit: After being told this is a British issue I have amended the secondary reason. 
[deleted]
Because some governments don't think through their legislation.
Why not stop taxing things punitively and instead focus on educating people to make better decisions? 
Why not just not tax sugar at all?
Or just don't tax it additionally at all. No one is forcing anybody to buy or eat sugary cereal.
Why not just encourage parents to read nutrition labels instead of adding another tax?
We should solve this problem upstream. We should stop subsidising corn based sugar. Why on earth would you *subsidise* something you are willing to regulate to reduce? It's regulation in two different directions simultaneously.  
In Chicago, we tried this with our Sugar Tax on penny per ounce drinks. If it had sugar, or sugar substitutes, it was taxed penny per ounce of drink. This did not go over very well. And was repealed after a month. It really hurts small businesses, who have to pay the tax tinthe suppliers, and then charge the tax to customers because we don't get that money back. At least that's how my boss explained it to me.
[deleted]
I remember those commercials, complete with a choir of *children* singing 

"Frosted Flakes are moooooore than good...."

Where the cartoon tiger then says

"Theyrrrrrre grrrrreat!!"
Oh shit when you get older you can sleep in LONGER?! I've been doing this all wrong 
I'd argue you're not really that old if you're not getting up early on Saturday mornings.
Right?

Like what about something like Cheerios?  I'd say 90+% of the people I see eating Cheerios are babies eating them out of little plastic bags.  And babies are even younger than most kids.

Or how about Honey Nut Cheerios?  There's a cartoon bee, but I don't imagine a lot of kids are begging their parents for a slightly less cardboard version of Cheerios.

Something like Trix or Cinnamon Toast Crunch is easy because the ads explicitly talk about kids as a separate class with cereal-related privileges.  But what about Frosted Mini-Wheats, where the ads are targeted at both adults and the "kid inside" the adults?

We should avoid having laws that make subjective distinctions like that.

Also I think the best cereal is Krave.  It's like Cap'n Crunch filled with chocolate, but the chocolate isn't too sweet like you'd expect it to be.  It's very good.
> Kellogg's defended the decision and claimed that Tony the Tiger was an "adult cartoon"  that appealed to Millennials in their 20s and 30s. 

They're kind of right, we all saw Tony the Tiger in ads when we were *kids* and remember him well.  My kids don't know who the hell Tony the Tiger is, they don't see his ads during Saturday morning cartoons, they watch Youtube.
As a full grown adult, I am insulted by any attempt to categorize these glorious foodstuffs as "kids food".

I probably eat more Frosted Flakes now than I did as a kid...because as a kid I always found it kind of boring (what? just flakes?) and it always got soggy.  Now that I have perfected my milk-first technique (and keep adding cereal until it is gone) sogginess isn't a problem and I have come to realize that the sweet flakes are delightful.  Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Cap'n Crunch (Regular and Peanut Butter), Fruity Pebbles, Honey Bunches of Oats, Cracklin Oat Bran...all perfectly good Adult Foods.

Except for cookie crisp.  That stuff is definitely "kids food".  Not because adults shouldn't be able to eat cookies for breakfast if they want to, but because it fucking sucks.  Little discs of cardboard with chocolate-colored spots.  It is "kids food" because only a child with limited personal agency would be blinded by the fact that it sort of looks like a cookie and would continue to consume cookie crisp despite numerous superior options.
Me too! I don't usually eat them for breakfast though, I treat them as a snack or dessert.
Right there with you buddy!
We weren’t allowed to have Lucky Charms or Cinnamon Toast Crunch as kids (not because of the sugar but because of the cost). As a young adult I ate the shit out of both since I could afford it, but now I’m 30 and actually have to watch what I eat. The small window of opportunity was cruel.
Froot loops are Kellogg too. Easily the slowest seller out of Frosted Flakes, Apple Jack's and Froot Loops in my area. Glad you like em. Wish I could get rid of them faster.
I love all of those, but I eat them like a dessert treat and not for breakfast these days!
if this was true then you would know it's spelled froot loops you damn dirty liar
I have a sensitive gut. My favorite cereals give me crampy soft atools, if not diarrhea. CTC, Froot Loops, Captain Crunch. I have to eat bran cereal and Kashi. Kashis actually pretty good.
There's a website for people like you, I think it's called Cerealously
Si. And I like potatoes.
Golden Grahams are the best.
They just need to slap some Hentai on it instead.
Surely you’re not referring to “Anthony the Panthera Tigris”?  
His appearance on the box, rendered in a faux-realistic art style, has educated discerning shoppers for generations about his meal’s greatness.
So my imagination about all the comercials as a kid of him and a bunch of kids doing sports things means he wasn't aimed at kids? What else would it be?
That’s gonna suck if a South Park or Rick and Morty cereal comes out.
And every single advert for the cereal absolutely focuses on the kids.
Not unless the target audience is furries.
I don't know... there are plenty of cartoons that aren't meant for kids.
Like Joe Camel and cigarettes.
They intend to remove any advertising aspect that might link them to kids... This could be the end of Tony
I am pretty sure the idea that cartoons are only for kids went out the window with the Youtube non-kids creepy cartoon problem. 
it's called hentai, and it's art.
You know, I think back on all those years the little leprechaun struggled desperately to keep lucky charms out of the hands of children...it all makes sense now.

Crunchy Nut, pretty expensive as I recall... 
Crunchy Nut is just Frosties for wankers.
Butter the toast, eat the toast, shit the toast. God, life's relentless. 
That would affect sales even if only adults were currently eating it. 
You could do that with literally any product and tank the sales.
or in the aisle with condoms and pregnancy tests.
I don’t think adult necessarily need to mean boring.
And advertise during CSI Miami instead of on Nickelodeon
Much like baby food.  Babies don't seem to care for it at all, looking at these latest sales figures.

Lol true. This is like when folks were getting all up in the air about how fast food was getting their children fat. Jus exercise some parental control here for Pete's sake, I mean your kid has neither the money nor the means of transportation to eat there. All the king, the colonel and the clown did is open up a business. You don't hafta eat there! 
Honestly it's hardly even a loophole, just shitty legislation 
i thought the same thing. Very similar to the smoke alarm/instrument episode.
That should be the main discussion to be had from this article.  Instead it's a lot of people scolding the corporation for not doing the right thing and voluntarily paying more taxes.

Why the fuck is there a loophole that exists where kid cereal and adult cereal is taxed differently?  Who are the fucking retards in charge of writing this legislation?  Those are the questions we need to ask.   Not "OMG why on earth would a corporation choose to pay less taxes?" 
You can change though, and change kids for their adult lives. Make sure kids are fed vegetables early and don't make it out to be some gross evil. I mean you still get pushback but it really affects their adult life. For adults, just start incorporating new foods slowly and phase out sugar. Like sodas, drink diet, maybe pick up teas or fruit juice, eventually have either unsweet tea or water with lemon, you're a step away from glasses of water and you've eliminated sugar. I eat salads for lunch. Use to eat cereal and burgers and shit all the time. Just takes motivation and time which is what makes it hard.
A trick i learned is to try and buy your foods from the edges of the grocery store, not the aisles. The edges have all the 'whole foods'
I swear I thought you were going to talk about sugar quotas.  Or at least I was hoping you were going to.

Better start saving up for that insulin pump now. 
Sounds like they got you figured out. 
If there no marshmallows in any of the cereals in the house, they’ll come around.
I want a "cereal" with all marshmallows.
You should watch the documentary "Fed Up". Companies love moving the conversation away from sugar and instead focusing on exercise. Eating unhealthy is not fixed with exercise. 
I mean even the *title* sounds like it's more about how stupid the legislation is.
I'm with you. Taxing cereal is just stupid and won't fix the issue. 
I saw plenty of Zucaritas while I lived in El Paso. So it's in the States as well.
> the name in latin america is Zucaritas

Only for the Spanish-speaking countries.

In the Portuguese-speaking Brazil (⅓ of the Latin America population) is called Sucrilhos. And the name is so famous that it is actually used as a metonymy for all morning cereal.
They sell Chocozucaritas in the US; they are so good if you can find them. 
Sugar - Azucar

Suffix *ita* means little

Azucaritas means *little sugars*

Zucaritas is slightly stylized but yes
I swear Zucaritas in Mexico have way more sugar than frosted flakes in the US. I've never took the time to check, but Zucaritas are way too sweet for me while I enjoy Frosted Flakes in the US.
¿Qué tal el especial sabor de Nestlé Zucosos?

In my local markets in the Midwest I see chocolate Frosted Flakes labeled as Zucaritas.
Ah, yes, the time of the corn Frost is upon us. 
Next wiki batshit-crazy [John Harvey Kellogg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg)
Sucrilhos has no translation. It's just the brand name, although it is making a play on the sonorit of "açúcar/açucarado" (sugar/sugared). 
I just want to know if... there Great!!! in all countries?
Can you tell me what the jingle for this cereal is?? Here it’s “Frosted flakes! They’re more than good! (In Tony the Tiger’s voice) They’re Great!”
I went to Canada last year and it was like some bizarre alternate reality. Everything was 90% the same as it is in the US, but there were minor differences everywhere that felt weird. The grocery store had weird versions of products that I'd never seen before and all the packaging was slightly different and had French on the back. The weirdest thing was that apparently you call Reese's "Reese" instead, which makes no sense to me.

Edit: [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/7LNj4hH.jpg) a photo I took of the Reese packaging at the WalMart in Pincher Creek, AB.

Edit 2: Also, poutine is amazing.
Let's be honest. Canada is essentially an extension of the US. Whenever someone says "outside the US," they mean overseas.
when i was a kid they were called *sugar frosted flakes*. 'sugar' was right in the name on the box and advertisements.

that wasn't the only one with 'sugar' right in the name, either.. there was also *super sugar crisp*
That would be the truth-it's candy.
Funny enough, yea. That's how businesses work.

I can't remember every detail, but I think texas/US said you can't sell flavored cigarettes. So Black's (menthol flavor) made their paper .0005 inches thicker and called it a mini-cigar. **EDIT** I got the cigarette type wrong, i honestly just forgot which one it was but there's way more answers below anyways. Sorry guys!

You do what you do to get around this crap if you own a business, that's just standard practice =/
Then we should just have an added sugar tax on all food items
It's soup. 
They put a thin layer of felt on the bottom of the box so they can classify it as slippers instead.
It’s dog food
Absolutely. It sounds funny but it’s really conniving, and they’re able to do it because there’s nothing really stopping them. Converse sells themselves as slippers to avoid tax, some company trademarked “Real Cheez” and shoved it on their snacks to confuse some people, advertisers think telling us our food is fresh and real is a selling point rather than something we should long expected from our food — and at the same time they lie about it.

In simplest terms: Food industry’s all fucked, yo...
I mean it's obviously not the perfect solution but as an adult I feel I personally should be able to allocate my sugar intake if it's reasonable. When it's obviously marketed towards kids it is significantly more impactful (and it should be taxed as such in accordance with this bill), but no adult with reasonable and standard nutritional knowledge should feel swindled by a sugary cereal if it's not marketed as healthy from the get-go. If the sugar content is something unreasonable (I know arbitrary/subjective I'm sorry) then I can see it, however sugar isn't dangerous in rational amounts and not even in the cliche libertarian sense but I think it's something if marketed towards adults we should genuinely fault the consumer on the individual level and not the market, if that market did not advertise the sugary cereal as healthy.

For what it's worth Kellogg's is obviously a piece of shit in this situation however sugar is much much much more detrimental to children who are more impressionable and with less impulse control than a fully grown adult who makes their own meal choices.
More like “Won’t somebody PLEASE think of the kickbacks I get from the industry I’m negotiating with under the table?!”
Some do. You get headlines for the new law to gain voters. You write it so that it’s easily circumvented and don’t piss off your corporate overlords. 

Win/win. 
Don't be naive, bills are written with loopholes on purpose. They think them through very well.
Government conspires with special interests to write laws that are palatable (sellable to the public, in other words) but written to benefit those who conspired. 

When you give the government unlimited regulatory power, this is what happens. Millions of regulations that no one really knows or cares about that benefit a certain few under the guise of the "public good."
No cartoons ✔

No sugar in cereal ✔

Halloween ruined ✔

WTF is going on?
Cartoons are on all day, every day, multiple channels.
Saturday mornings are now where networks dump their required educational/informative programs. Usually about animals or science.
I think the advent of the on-demand/streaming age has killed that concept.

The problem is that there's still a line somewhere.  What's cereal?  Does granola count?  What exactly makes Goldfish functionally different than cereal?  How is Cookie Crisp in any way distinguishable from mini-Chips Ahoy?  
I don't think I've ever seen somebody buy Apple Jacks that weren't in a variety pack.

Stupid legistlation at that. 

It's not kids buying this shit and getting kids fat, it's their irresponsible parents. If you don't want your kid getting fat, don't fill them up with sugar. Not hard. 
The real discussion should be that cereal, pretty much *all* cereal, is not great for you and should be eaten in moderation.  They all have about the same amount of calories and carbs for the most part.
The minute you start looking for things like corn syrup, palm or soy oils in your food, you pretty much cross off any sort of convenience food. 
Hey she can ask... I don't have to buy.
Also, at least for new parents, just never buy those cereals to begin with. 
There's a few places online that sell just the marshmallows.  
El Paso is pretty much Mexico
So kind of how Coke is synonymous for all carbonated drinks in the south.
God I love Reddit sometimes
At least in Puerto Rican Spanish, Corn Flakes has that honor.

"Get me some Corn Flakes."

"Which kind?"

"Fruit Loops if they have them."
at one moment in my country due to lack of sugar you would only find chocozucaritas for some reason, can say I started hating them after a while.
They're more than good...
A quick Google says Zucaritas are 40% pure sugar, compared to 35% for frosted flakes.

It is kinda crazy someone made frosted flakes and decided "this needs even more added sugar". 
Nothing really, Nestlé just really hates tigers and likes polar bears
Bigger sugar? or something along those lines haha.

Zucharitos! M-m-m-Mucho Bueno!
Hey Tony! I like the things you do...
Do they have *Berenstein* Bears books there, as well?
Am Canadian. Have literally never heard anyone say just "Reese." I've always heard "I'll have a Reese's" and I'm pretty sure the package says "Reese's Peanut Butter Cup" on it. 
I haven't picked up a chocolate bar in years. They were Reese's (cups and pieces) when I was a kid though. 

I bet the stores in the US sell the exact same product with a slightly different package like in Canada. I can walk into a grocery store and pick up the cheap juice and the middle ground juice and the expensive juice. There's a good chance I can find three that were made in the same factory and have the same ingredient list and sometimes they'll even have different brand names but with the exact same item description.
Wait, THREE peanut butter cups?! What the fuck! Us American chumps only get two!
My guess for the "Reese" thing is so that it still makes sense in French, since the apostrophe-s contraction would be replaced with "de" in front of the word. "De Reese's" probably looks too weird.

Reese's Pieces still have the S, though.
Growing up near Chicago I didn’t notice much of a difference when visiting Toronto, but I think the northern Midwest probably gets more Canadian imports than they do Mexican imports. Book stores in the Chicagoland area often had US and Canadian prices, French on the back of products, etc. I moved to California and everything is in Spanish more so than it is in Chicago. I imagine other parts of Canada are different like that too
As a Canadian i feel the same way when I'm in the states.
> The weirdest thing was that apparently you call Reese's "Reese" instead, which makes no sense to me.

KD / Mac n Cheese is the most common one I hear
It says "Reese" on the package, but we still call them Reese's.

Okay now I'm having a damn Mandela Effect (and I don't even believe in those) because I've lived in Canada my whole life (BC) and everyone says Reese's peanut butter cups/ Reese's pieces (although we do pronounce it like the name, not ree-cee's because wtf is that)
When I went to Windsor ON, things were weird. Gas being sold in liters. Speed limit signs in KPH. None of the stores on the border took Visa, only MasterCard??? The Timmy’s took American cash but gave back Canadian. The weirdest thing was the question marks. We kept seeing street signs that were simply a question mark in a box with an arrow pointing ahead. Mystery Spot? We didn’t find out. 
Yeah but don't forget milk in bags, "Kraft Dinner" and Tim Hortons. 
You're right, but US Smarties and Canadian Smarties are two completely different things.
As a Canadian, fuck you buddy. Illinois is just an extension of Canada.
And yet, Corn Pops are the same cereal, yet completely different. Looks like puffed corn in the US and formed balls that look more like Kix in Canada.   Even Honey Nut Cheerios have a glaze in the US and not in Canada.  There are so many odd little differences that don't make sense.
>Let's be honest. Canada is essentially an extension of the US.

An extension with Kinder Surprise!


If you think Canada is just an extension of the US, you have never been to Canada. We do have a lot of the same products because of the shared border but culturally both countries are kilometres (miles) apart.
Breakfast candy**
[deleted]
There's like three cereals that aren't candy and most of them tast like cardboard to oatmeal.
Years ago, cereal made a slow transition into breakfast candy. They finally crossed the line with Cookie Crisp. Cookie Crisp is not cereal. It is Cookies.
You want to know what cereal is actual candy? Mother fucking waffle crisps. That shit is so addictive
They purposefully keep the sugar content under 50% to prevent being categorized as candy.

Twix are officially a cookie and not a candy bar thus they avoid sales tax here in Florida. 
Marvel argued that their x-men mutant action figures were not human to avoid an import tax.
I read not to long ago that a famous sneaker brand (Converse I think) also does tricky stuff with their materials so they can import their footwear as slippers instead of shoes, which saves them millions in taxes.
Converse ships their sneakers with a thin layer of felt on the bottom so they can classify as "slippers" and avoid an import tax.
You're not wrong, but menthols are still allowed in the US, just every other flavor that's not mint, and to be called a mini-cigar, they have to have a tobacco wrapping, not paper.
It's almost as if we should have a thorough public deliberation process before we pass laws instead of ramming them through from secret back rooms.
I agree, though you know they'll try and add "dehydrated sugar beet powder" or something instead.
That’s a bit silly and too much, don’t you think?
Then they'll claim it's not real food.

They're missing out on those sweet rabbit food tax breaks, but that just demonstrates the integrity of the General Mills corporation.

That's the trick. My kids have never tasted cereal with marshmallows in it, so they don't crave it. A couple of times they asked for some sugary cereal because of the cartoon character on the cover, but I told them "No, that's not real cereal, that's candy."

El Paso is one of the few places in the US where you’re better off knowing Spanish rather than English. 72% of residents speak Spanish at home, way higher a percentage than any other city in the US.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_Spanish-speaking_population
Pretty much. I thought it was going to a lot worse than it was. Lived there for 3 1/2 years and never saw any violence.
Anything South of San Antonio is pretty much Northern North Mexico
Fun story. I was taking the bus from Phoenix to Georgia (a different story). We pulled in to El Paso and the driver pointed out some little shacks out the window, over a barbed wire fence saying, "That's Mexico." Then a voice from the back of the bus yelled, "That ain't Mexico." Bus driver: "Sir, that is Mexico." The voice continued to argue that it wasn't while the bus driver said it was. I couldn't believe I was hearing an argument between some jerk on the bus and the driver about whether or not the shanties were actually in Mexico. They looked like Mexico to me.

Border Patrol or INS got on the bus not much later and asked us each if we were US citizens. My olive skinned, brunette cousin (born and raised in Georgia) was asleep when the bus driver explained what was going down. When the men came on the bus, she woke up. I told her, "these men are going to ask us a question just say 'si'."
Texas was pretty much México.
I mean if you look at a birds eye photograph both El Paso and Juarez look like one city.

A Song of Frost and Milk
Thank *you* for the friendly compliment, stranger!
I once sat in on a voice over session featuring the guy who does tony the tiger circa 2005ish. hes a pretty funny guy. he tells the (joke) story of how he got the job. he met one of the producers and told him "YOUR WIFES TITS ARE GRRRRRREAT!" and then instantly got offered the job. i was crippled with laughter for a good while. 
As an adult there is nothing that makes want to buy a cereal more than a cartoon tiger.
Oh boy, here we go...
I thought we settled this with the cassette that had both spellings on it
[deleted]
[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/7LNj4hH.jpg) a photo I got of the packaging. This was at the WalMart in Pincher Creek, AB.
am canadian can confirm everyone says reese's
Bagged milk is available across Canada but it is far more common and popular farther East. I don't even remember the last time I saw bagged Milk, and I've never bought it. My grandmother bought it all the time and it just made the fridge smell like a baby threw up in it because the stupid container holding the bag would always accumulate dribblings. Not keen on reliving that. I think even in the East you can still get Milk normally in Cartons and Jugs.

"Kraft Dinner" was introduced in Canada and the United States during the Great Depression, thus it's name since it could pass for a "dinner". The United States later rebranded it as "Mac & Cheese" but Canada has kept the original Depression-era brand; the two products are identical.

Don't get me started on Tim Hortons. Nothing quite get's my goat as much as that shithole being a "Canadian symbol". They basically forced themselves as one with their stupid commercials. American's get a lot of flak but at least they were smart enough to drive Tim Hortons out. Tim Hortons can Roll up the rim to fuck off.


And the Canadian Smarties are far superior.
Illinois is a weird state to pick for that statement...I would've expected North Dakota, Michigan, or Maine.
So, IHOP?
'I had a bowl of smarties for breakfast'

'Oh I didn't know smarties made a cereal'

'They don't. I put smarties in a bowl with milk.'
What about chex, crispix and Wheaties?
21grams of sugar out of 100gram. Nah thats candy. 

Edit : A few people have pointed out the cheerios i've linked below are wrong, Original cheerios seem pretty decent. 

http://www.cheerios.com/Products/Cheerios
1. Mash cereal.
2. Mix with cream cheese.
3. Cover in chocolate.
4. "Homemade" candy bar.

Generally tasty.
Shredded wheat is my goto 
Cheerios may not be candy, but it's so processed it's basically void of any nutrition. 
All these replies, it just shows you how much of this is completely common in business.

Government: "We're taxing [item] here."

Business: "Introducing our new product! It's the same as the old product, but it's not an [item]!"
"Dolls" imported into the US are taxed at a different, higher rate from generic "Toys." "Dolls" in this case being "toys that represent a human being."

So of course Marvel argued successfully that Mutants aren't humans and thus Xmen figures were "toys" and not "dolls."
Which goes against one of the core messages of X-Men.
Why are human figures taxed?
Their technically not wrong.
I love that there is an official court record documenting that the X-Men aren't human.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Biz,_Inc._v._United_States

Toy Biz successfully argued they were non human toys, not dolls. Tariffs for toys was less than dolls by almost half. Apparently the category has since merged into one. 
They put a layer of felt over the sole before shipping them out if I remember right.

EDIT: Felt, not velvet. My bad. 
"The problem here is the government, not the companies who are cheating us out of millions, if not billions, of infrastructure dollars!"
They already do that.  There's over 50 different names for what is basically glucose+fructose.
>obesity epidemic

What was it like grandpa?

OOOOOH it was horrible Johnny, there was cheesecakes and porkchops everywhere!
When I was a kid we all ate all kinds of shit food. Nobody was fat because we ran free all day outside.
Halloween being ruined isn't part of the obesity epidemic, although I would almost put it as a symptom of what's *causing* the obesity epidemic. Now this is going to take a second, but hear me out:

I actually put helicopter parents as a defining cause of the obesity issue-- at least in the United States, I can't speak for other countries. I personally think that because parents are controlling how far their children go and ensuring that they're always within eye-shot that they aren't going outside and is increasing the amount that they're spending on games, TV, or just staying indoors... after all, Billy is so much safer when he's in the house.

Halloween has been ruined because of helicopter parents as well. Suddenly they can't just go roaming around the streets for candy, they have to be brought to a parking lot with cars getting candy from them (look up Trunk 'r Treating). Or some parents do door-to-door but DRIVE THEM TO EACH HOUSE.

Shuffling kids indoors to make them safer is, I believe, a huge aspect of the obesity issue. Sugary cereal definitely does have a place as a cause, but if those fucks would run around from lunch to sunset it wouldn't matter if they were eating Lucky Charms.
Yup. It was all my doing.
... Unless classifying it as pet food results in further tax breaks, in which case Trix are only for rabbits - why do you think there's a rabbit on the box? - and how dare you imply otherwise.
Oh it's much deeper than that.

That 'he' did and then Chester of cheetos fame tweeted something to the tune of Tonys spurned furries were welcome to follow him. Cheetos is grown up crisps/chips/puffs/whatever they are were you are.
Yup. Well something like that.


Then the Cheetos mascot came in and basically said “I love furries, come to me instead”. 

But I guess Cheetos is more of a stoner/teen snack anyway (at least in terms of stereotype). 
They're! Grrr!-uuhhuhhh-reat...
Well I mean we're probably going to have to assume it's Tony the Tiger's ejaculate.

If you're asking my opinion on whether Kellogs Mini Wheats are aimed at kids? 

Yes they are a more *child friendly* version of Shredded Wheat, however I don't think they target kids in the same way Frosties do. Specifically due to the lack of cartoon mascot and the Shredded Wheat as a brand isn't particularly appealing to kids.
Anything's disposable if you're rich enough
The naming is the problem? They could call it "Free Blowjobs For Eating This" and I still wouldn't eat beef mush in a jar. 
The title artist doesn't mean you are being paid.
fun fact, El Paso is typically among the lowest 3 in murder rate of any US city over 500k.

edit: http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-El-Paso-Texas.html

They fluctuate between 0.8 to 3.4 per 100k since 2004. Very low especially considering it's not a wealthy city. 

 
There is another metro area with less total residents and more actual humans that speak Spanish. This results in an 84% for the same metric you mentioned.

With that being said El Paso does not have a higher percentage than any other city in the US. El Paso does not even hold that title for Texas.
Aye carumba 
I'm pretty sure even most Anglos in El Paso speak Spanish, right? I know Beto O'Rourke is fluent. 
Out in the west Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl.

It's more like "rees-is" here. 
There are two types of people in this world: those I can stand talking to and those who pronounce it "Ree-sees Pee-sees."
Yeah you're totally right that is the way it is here. I guess I never noticed because everyone I know says "Reese's"
The only time I've ever seen bagged milk in the US was that one night I spent in jail.... it was served with my breakfast at 4am.

I very carefully used it as a pillow.
we have bagged milk here in the upper midwest, too, but my canadian buddies and their kids all say the kd is better 'back home' then the american crap and cheese we have here.
Never seen bagged milk in any store in Sask
Saw a Tim Hortons while traveling through West Virginia this past year.  It just seemed like another dunkin donuts style place.
Every time I travel to Canada for work, my kids beg me to bring back Smarties.  I have to admit, I do like them better than M&Ms.  

American milk chocolate is horrible.  It didn't used to be.
We have Smarties and we also have the US version of Smarties - They're called rockets!
so are our rockets 
Or Minnesota. We've got everything here, hockey, stereotypical Canadian accents, moose, etc.

They're running an ad right now on TV for cheesecake-stuffed French toast. 
The horton pancakes. There was more candy and sugar gunk than pancakes on the plate. 
IHOP is more breakfast cake than candies.
And ironically, kids eat free at IHOP. 
Nerds and fruit punch man.
Wheaties has 5.5 grams of sugar vs. Cheerios 1.2 grams.  I no longer buy Wheaties as a result.
Those are Multigrain, not real Cheerios.  Multigrain is a complete ripoff; instead of 100% oats like old-school Cheerios, they took advantage of peoples' tendency to mindlessly assume multigrain = healthier, changed the main ingredient to cheap shitty corn, and decreased the serving size so they could load it up with sugar while keeping the calories/serving the same.
Well now I'm just disappointed...
I have one called Breakfast Candy. It's the quick candy stuff you can buy at the store (the vanilla stuff, not the chocolate). You melt it down and combine it with Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

You're welcome. It's super addictive, super easy to make, and delicious enough people have asked me to make it for money.
The old school stuff too, none of that mini bullshit. I want my breakfast to be a 5lb bail of wheat lightly moistened with milk. So good. 
SUV's are light trucks, not cars, in order to avoid emissions standards.
I've always thought the message had an "They may not be human, but that doesn't mean they're not people" aspect to it. Depending on which mutant you asked, anyway. Different mutants had different viewpoints.
Not exactly, mutants accept they aren't the same as humans but that doesn't mean they should be dehumanized.
Xmen are *Homo Superior*, not *Homo Sapien*. Technically, we would be their prey, or at least they would be justified in wiping us out so we dont compete for resources.
Because they are considered as dolls, which aren't taxed the same (for some reason)
Because of the doll lobby. Which yes, I know, sounds silly.

Basically someone somewhere owned a doll factory, and didn't want competition from China pricing him out of the market. He contacted his local rep, and they added this exception. Toys are fine, but this one particular toy (a doll) is protected because some politician cared, because someone with marginal pull in his riding asked him.

If it seems weird that a global super power will hamper it's trade policy based on the objection of a small factory owner, you are right.  The way the US federal government determines policies is freaking bonkers, mostly because the senate.

Senators have more power than presidents for certain legislative carve outs. Because of the structure of the senate (rare elections, small size, seniority system, the sub-committee system), it's not uncommon for certain small state senators to wield unreasonable federal power.  

Take Utah, it's a state with 3 million people in it. Orin Hatch is the Sr. senator from Utah, and he's been in the senate 40 years. He's chairman of the finance comittee, which basically means appropriations bills go through him. For a country of 300 million people, Orin Hatch, who represents a state with 1% of that, is one of the top 4 people who have to sign off on any particular of any spending bill. So right now, any spending bill that screws over Utah won't pass the senate.  He has this power because he's been in the senate longer than anyone else, so of course, people in his small state would be crazy to vote him out.  Utah only has 4 seats in the house of representatives, it's electoral college seats are meaningless. The only way Utah has to effect the federal government is through long serving senators who amass kind of crazy levels of influence through the seniority system.

Of course, this is self reinforcing. Orin Hatch doesn't have to worry about re-election. He is basically in charge of his committee until he chooses to resign. Which makes him even more powerful. Presidents have time limits, they have huge constituencies, they have 1000 things on their plate.  Senators have forever, and only have to care about whatever it is they feel like.

If a Sr. senator wants to protect a special interest in his small state, there really isn't much stopping him from doing so.  Utah isn't even that small of a state, there are 20 states out there that are smaller. So you get all these weird, tiny states out there, who get to have a massive outsized say on weird elements of foreign policy. Idaho get's to determin foreign aid. Alaska gets to plan infrastructure planning, etc.  The senators then trade favours with each other to maximize their state's reach.

But yeah, it comes down to some doll factory in some tiny state had a senator, who probably liked the owner. So international trade got restructured to help him out.


The standing ruling is that toys which are human figures are seen as dolls rather than toys for tax purposes. Tariffs like these are pretty standard. Their propose to discourage moving jobs overseas (and to lessen the revenue impact when it does happen). 
This is one of those times where they aren't sneaking. They're setting a precedent.

"Here are those people action figures"

"They're *MUTANTS*"
Yes, but your use of "their" is technically wrong.
[deleted]
Makes them slippery as heck for the first week or so. 
Thought it was felt, but yeah
I bought a pair of shoes from Target recently that had that felt on them, and I was absolutely perplexed until a read about what Converse does. Strangely, even though the shoes I bought look like running shoes, they're classified as sandals, which I guess also has tax implications.
Billions per individual company of significant size, trillions if totaled up among all businesses I'm sure.

Greg Giraldo quote :) Also part of a Lazyboy song called "Underwear goes inside the pants"  https://youtu.be/ahlWufJqcSQ
>What was it like grandpa?


Well, Johnny. It all started back in the 50s, oh, excuse me, the 1950s. The 2050s had their own different set of problems. The Sugar Council had managed to drum up some questionable studies linking obesity and heart disease to fats. It didn’t matter what kind of fat it was, they eventually got folks thinking all fat was bad for you. Over the decades, television advertising grew by leaps and bounds and began marketing their sugar laden cereals and treats directly to children during the five long stretch of Saturday morning cartoons and after school programming before the evening news. Of course, children would plead to their parents for these disasters disguised as food. 

Portion sizes grew over those decades as well, mostly in the old USA and Canada. When the internet was in its glory days in the twenty-aughts and early twenty-teens, you’d see people post pictures of a paper soda cup they brought back from a trip to France or the like. In France, a large Coke was barely a small Coke in the US. People were drinking their calories along with eating them. Some large cities tried to tax sodas and other sugary beverages, but people said that such things would affect the poorer castes. 

The problem, in truth, was that convenience and fast foods, all heavily laden with added sugars, fats, and preservatives, were more affordable to the poorer castes than fresh produce, meats, and dairy. Some ghettos, other inner-urban areas, and rural areas didn’t have a grocery store, only gas stations with convenience marts or fast food restaurants. Some people couldn’t afford to travel to the nearest grocery.  It was FUBAR, Johnny. 

Things came to a head in the twenty-twenties and the HAES war broke out. Those were dark days, Johnny, dark days. Out of the ashes of that war came the way we live now: The Rationing. From birth, our bodies are analyzed to determine the appropriate amounts of nutrients it needs at various stages in life. The slurry we get four times daily from the community meal hub, places of work, or places of education is determined by the RFID chip in our wrists. No longer are there gluttons among us, nor are there people starving in the world. People still wonder if the cost outweighs the benefits, but no one knows how to cook any more. 
I miss Greg...

All that sugar and wheaties still tastes like shit
I dont even shop in the aisles anymore, just the edges of the grocery store. The aisles are full of sugar, thats it.
Health-conscious consumers also have to watch because a lot of the knock-off brands aren't made of oats and Cheerios made of corn don't have the health benefits of oats.

Magneto did nothing wrong. 
I realize that argument is straight from the comics, but it always seemed so shallow to me. The fact that they can clearly create viable offspring with homo sapiens proves themselves, by definition, to be the same species. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/species and https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_41
The American doll lobby wanted protection from foreign competition (which I know sounds silly, but this is America). You can listen to an excellent podcast on the subject [here](http://www.radiolab.org/story/177199-mutant-rights/).
Wouldn't you also want to discourage jobs creating animal figures from moving overseas too? It seems like an odd line to draw.
They're mutated humans though. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
This shouldn’t be overlooked.
No one keeps their chucks for less than 5 years, though, so it's moot.
Not sure if this is an unintentional pun.

By adding that layer at the bottom they can clarify them as slippers when I'mporting into the US. I don't think you get them like that in NZ or Europe.

In the UK they've always been Frosties... Kellogs regularly brand differently in UK as opposed to the US eg, Coco Pops/Cocoa Krispies
This man has a point.
I was murdered there and this surprises me
That surpsises me but when you look at murder rates, some of the safest cities are near the border. I'm guessing that those criminal elements don't want to be caught anywhere near the Mexico border. 

San Diego is one of the safest cities as well. It has the lowest murder rate of any city over 1m.  It has a similar murder rate to El Paso.

This is what they preach in Ketosis dieting. The aisles are where all the carbs are. Also, all the profit margins.

Right? Then they're TOTALLY mutants
magneto took the right point from the holocaust, its better the be the holocauster than the holocaustiee
Welcome to die!
That’s the short explanation of a species, but as with a lot of things there are exceptions. For example, a zebra can breed with a donkey (*zonkey*), a lion with a tiger (*liger*), a bison and a cow (*beefalo*), and many others. It doesn’t strain belief that a Homo Superior could produce viable offspring with a Homo Sapien. Hell, these people are shooting lasers out of their eyes and that’s the thing your concerned about, something that has already been well documented scientifically?
would the child have mutant powers or not? Mutantism crossed all racial barriers, but you could define it at that point to be a type of race, if they are indeed the same species. Homo Sapiens are thought to have bred with other Homo species, breeding viable offspring, though one of the characteristic of a species(meaning without it it CAN'T be a species) is not entirely indicative of two organisms being the SAME species. 
Are their children sterile? I feel that's important. Think donkey and horse makes mule. 
Most geneticists consider Neanderthals and H. sapiens to be two distinct species, but there was interbreeding between them with viable offspring. A more modern example of cross-species breeding would be designer cats like the Savannah (serval x domestic cat) or any number of wolf/jackal/coyote/dog hybrids.
They do, just at a much lower rate. I agree it's arbitrary, or there's market factors you and I  don't know about behind the difference.
That's the joke. He's referring to the X-Men universe where mutants aren't considered human.
You're a mutated human too. Humans get about 20 mutations per generation.
Youve worn a pair daily and had them last 5 years? I cant get more than 8 months out of a pair of the standard chucks
True dat. I have a pair I wear infrequently that I’ve has for 10 years. I go through the standard black high tops the fastest, by it’s usually a couple years for this since I alternate. I mean, I wear the black ones 50% of the time and thw other 7 pairs alternating for the other 50%. 
If you're going to burn me, might I recommend a slow roast with essential herbs and spices? I hear I go well with a Napa-sourced red wine or some well-aged scotch. 
As an American, the idea that you could be familiar with something from pop culture and not be able to easily buy it is so weird. 
You brits always have such cute names for everything.

"watch the telly"

"hope in the tube"
I've murdered there and that surprised me too. 
Seems you got better!
There are a couple of explanations for that in this story: https://www.texastribune.org/2016/02/23/border-communities-have-lower-crime-rates/.  First, there is a large amount of law enforcement presence of all kinds in the border towns.  Further, undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit violent crime than the population as a whole.  

And for all of the talk about walls, the border is pretty porous in the cities.  Many people travel back and forth to work, shop, and visit family on a daily basis.  They likely don't want to jeopardize their freedom to do that.
Git a rope.
Which first?
Yep! I do keto and very rarely buy stuff from the middle isles. It's all veggies, meats, eggs, and dairy. 
Mules too. Though all these exceptions have fertility problems. Beefalo can produce fully viable herds, but only after a few generations to reduce the percentage of Buffalo DNA. I’m pretty sure mutant/human offspring aren’t sterile.
Market factors are "hasbro paid of a politician."
The mutant bit leads an interesting question. Toad is sometimes depicted in a very inhuman manner. Some mutants are that way. Others, like Cyclops, look like a guy with sunglasses. Should the Cyclops toy impact the tax rates for the Toad toy.
Yeah, but a predisposition to cancer and diabetes isn't as cool as shooting laser beams from my eyes. 
No, I wear them on and off, but people who wear them seem to wear them until they've really worn out. I can't get more than a year out of any daily wear shoe.

I never trusted that frog.
That's what you get for eating pleb tier cereal! Call me when it hits Cinnamon Toast Crunch!
Really this is news? I work at a grocery store and we've had to notify people about this for awhile.
Ok yeah even at 8 years old I knew Smacks was poison
Who the fuck buys this shit 
I’m glad I’m an adult and don’t have to worry about that.
This is Kellogg's test market. They were pretty sure no one ate these anymore. This is instant feedback. 
After not eating cereal for decades, I recently strolled down the aisle. It has really changed. Except I still cannot figure why The Flintstones are still pushing cereal.
The only thing I got from this story is that 100 people ate Smacks, meaning sales are at an all-time high.
First McDonald's salad, now honey smacks? There's something fishy going on...
I’ll take some honey smacks! 
Is this cereal some kind of domestic violence in a box? 

I doing think we have this cereal in Canada 
Question i'm in CT if I see these should I ask the store owner to remove them?
Damn dude honey smacks are my favorite
Haha - Suck it Kellogg’s 
Wow this is really surprising, I had no idea that many people ate Honey Smacks!
See that’s why I don’t fuck wit frog cereal
Well you know what they say, smack smack sugar smack, give me a smack and I’ll smack you back. 
If you dont finish that crap in 5 minutes it becomes uneatavle mush
I mean the frog was a dead giveaway there was salmonella in it.
That’s what you get for eating one of the worst cereals out there. That stuff sucks. 
I always associated salmonella as being on something that would be wet or moist, not dry cereal.  So this is dried salmonella?  What happened, was it soaked in salmonella?  Or the grains used had salmonella and after going through heavy duty processing it still has active salmonella?
Honey Smacks sounds like flavored heroin.
This isnt something you try to hide for a month, kellogs
what sucks is this is making me *want* Honey Smacks.
Good news only 100 people eat honey smacks anyway. 
They had signs up about this in my local grocery store when I was there on Tuesday. 
BAN IT like they wanted to ban kratom.
After I eat this cereal my pee always smells like it. They should check that out too
This is just another reason I... can’t get enough of that sugar crisp. 
I'm more surprised that they found 100 people who actually eat that shit. Now that's newsworthy! 
Also not reported are the 10,000 who have been afflicted with diabetes from eating Honey Smacks. 
Is this cereal just like golden crisps with more salmonella?
Maybe a live chicken wandered in and fell into the cereal making machine.
Golden crisp is still good tho
I feel like these outbreaks are becoming more common. Or is it just more reporting of the same number of outbreaks.
As someone who works in a retail store, we got the recall notice for Honey Smacks almost a month ago, and we pulled and destroyed the boxes about 15 minutes after that. 

So, I would reconsider shopping somewhere that still has any boxes of them up. AFAIK, there haven't been any replacement "safe" boxes shipped yet. 
Smack! Smack! Honey Smacks! Gimme a smack and I'll ^give ^^you ^^^Salmonella!
Thank god I buy the generic brand from Aldi’s, Honey Wheat Puffs. Tastes the same at half the price. Actually, it’s more closer to Sugar Bear (can’t think of the real name). 
Jokes on you! I can’t afford name brand cereal!
(Hope everyone is fine)¡
Honey Smacks good, ya ya ya.....NO! NO! NO!
Damn, that's usually my go to cereal. I haven't eaten any this month though 
Good thing this cereal sucks and only weirdos like it

What about sugar bear sugar smacks? I have one unopened in my pantry...
I'm sorry did we not JUST have this issue with iceberg lettuce?

What the hell...

Edit:

Also wanted to share my salmonella story, just in case some of you are curious. 

I was decently young maybe 13 or 14. I was on a trip with my family, we ate at a little diner across from the hotel. It was a cute 60s retro styled cafe with rock music, and I ordered chicken strips for my dinner. I had eaten a couple and realized a few of them were cold, so I cut into one and it was extremely pink on the inside. Now, for some reason all I pictured at this age, of what an unsafe chicken looked like was a giant frozen uncooked chicken (like you were cut into). (I may have actually been younger) 

I considered showing the strips to my parents but being the teenage introvert I was I didn't want to draw attention to myself, so I just stopped eating them. We went to sleep and the next day was my family's religious convention, which lasts from about 8 am to 4 pm. In the middle of the convention, I started to have stomach pains so my mother took me to the nurses area they had set up for the convention.The woman takes my temp. and I am running a slight fever, she gives me something for it. I fall asleep, when I wake up my mom says she is taking me back to the hotel. 

That night I swear I thought I was dying, I never thought about mentioning the under cooked chicken, I just thought I had the worst flu in my life. After a while I couldn't keep water down, I was literally laying in the bathtub of the hotel bathroom and sleeping whenever my body would let me. The room was spinning the entire time, I don't recall the amount of times I threw up. I think it lasted about 8 hours, I may have actually blacked out and lost track of time.

I remember the following night I felt like I was on top of the world, I couldn't eat enough food my mother told me to slow down because she didn't want me to throw up again. The next day I am getting ready to the last day of the convention I go to grab my new dress for the occasion, this dress being very snug on me when I tried it on when we bought it. The dress was literally falling off my shoulders, my mom had to PIN the dress so it would stay on me. 

At 18 I had food poisoning again, and I am telling you...it doesn't even touch the effects of Salmonella food poisoning. 
They warned us about smack in school but we didn't listen
Are these the ones that make your piss wreak? I don't eat that shit neway
This is the type of thing that makes a brand disappear
whomst the fuck eats honey smacks???
We need to be careful in everything specially in our foods we ate and drinks that we are drank. 
Another Kellogg ploy to stop teens from masturbating.
On the upside there won't be anymore infections because that's the total number of people that actually eat honey smacks.
I smell a class action coming. 
Nooooo I fuckin love honey smacks
Thanks for not hiring me back in 2016 kellogs. 
Anyone that's eats that disgusting cereal deserves the sickness for allowing the cereal to continue
I’m honestly surprised that 100 people have eaten honey smacks cereal in the past few months
Glad I eat the malt o meal version I guess
If you freeze the cereal would it kill any potential salmonella on the cereal, making it safe to eat? Or would that be ineffective?
Eat shitty food get shitty prizes from your friends at Big Brand X!
I don't know why. In 1st grade I met a Mexican girl that just totally reminded me of this cereal. Her skin color was the same color as the cereal but that was as far as the similarities got. Ever since making that connection, honey smacks have made me gag. Thanks Sara, for keeping me safe! (Or should I thank my OCD?)
this is why less regulation in the industry is a must and not more.

Trump supporter
I ate a whole box of the shit with the barcode linked to the issue and I'm fine? How did I not get infected??? 
I don't get the appeal of cereal. There's cheaper and tastier food for breakfast imo. 
This probably only applies to affected Lot numbers.

Edit: changed SKU to Lot numbers because they’re not the same thing.
This is my favorite cereal ... I had a few boxes over the last 3-4 months but don’t have any anymore - didn’t get salmonella thankfully. 
[deleted]
I literally just freaking bought these yesterday. Dammit.
As far as I'm concerned, his name is Dig Them.
So I went to the Wiki for Honey Smacks. TIL that they’ve had multiple mascots since they were introduced in the 1950’s including a clown, a seal and Quick Draw McGraw. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Smacks?wprov=sfti1
For all I know there is some like Asian digging frog or something, but as far as I’m concerned frogs don’t dig. 
Hes just a pawn
[deleted]
well... it sounds like it's specific to this cereal, not other brands or companies, so it's probably not the raw ingredient, is my bet. sounds more like it's the factory where they make honey smacks had a problem keeping the place clean enough.
The frog fell in the honey vat, and that frog was nasty as hell. I think he had a drug problem.
Guarantee it's the bhtforfreshness.

Amazing what happens after the federal government removes 22 regulations for each one it adds
> Dang everything is contaminated. Can't have cereal or McDonald's salad.

If that's your extent of "everything", wow.
God forbid we stop eating sugary cereals and mcdicks haha. i love me some mcdonald's but yeah I would say the age of food we're living in is kind of the definition of Hubris. We're lucky we can get so fat. 
Good point.  I thought they were two different cereals, but I see they did change the name.  Apparently for a while they simply called them Smacks.
Pizza goes in an oven for a while, should be fine.
Don't jinx it.
Papa Johns must be onto something....
He knows what he’s doing
The generic brand name is something like golden puffs or something. Pretty good.
Nah man, that shit so unhealthy, and the drug reference kind of weirds me out which is why instead I start every day with a large bowl of Frosted Crack.
It’s good stuff when it’s not giving you salmonella 
[removed]
Probably the word "honey" being associated with sugary goodness in your brain. In this case though you should be thinking about the word "diarrhea".
Its kind of bitter covered with a tinge of honey flavor. Similar to a slightly burnt popcorn kernel dipped in a bit of honey.
I was surprised to see 100 people ate Honey Smacks.
It kind of tastes like coffee to me. Not bad, but not great.
Each "grain" of this cereal kinda looks like a hot dog bun and it's coated in this glossy sugar mix of honey. The box has a picture of a green frog-like character. I only know of it's existence because a long time ago I worked in a sandwich shop/convenience store that sold them. 
It was super delicious, my dad bought it a lot when we were growing up and we would just snack on it plain 
I loathe cereal, but I LOOOOVE smacks...my favourite food as a kid. Even dry. They're really awesome.
Seriously. I hated that shit as a kid. Can't imagine the taste has gotten any better, especially since Frosted Flakes were my favorite and they've seen gone down the tubes in taste :(
Mayor Adam West.
Or do what I do and stick to breakfast tacos.
that and corn pops are like the only cereals i like, but i don't eat ceral often. maybe once or twice a year now. 
I thought it disappeared with the 90s.
Don't give Starbuck's any ideas.
No, in 1957 it was Sugar Smacks.
And yet, several people in this thread hadn't heard of it. That must be how so many people got infected.
The Honey Smacks recall preceded the McDonalds problem by more than a month. The fact that you're only hearing about it now is one reason this outbreak affected so many. Somehow Kellogg's has kept it quiet.
Wheat or oats fertilized with shit and harvested too soon. 
I was just thinking when I was a kid and my mom would get the little variety pack of little cereal boxes, this shit was always the last one eaten or just thrown away. I remember it tasting like sugary wood or cardboard. 
It went directly into your spine and is now forming a tapeworm.
A box of even pretty nice cereal is like 5 bucks and you get 4-5 meals out of it. Hard to see how you could go much cheaper unless you’re eating plain white rice for breakfast. 
You don't get the appeal of something that you can eat straight out of the box and is also delicious?
Have you ever had a large bowl of fruity pebbles?  Might as well be crack rocks
The attraction is that it is quick
When I work late I usually grab a cup worth of dry cereal and a glass of milk before bed. It takes zero prep time and it's pretty easy on the guts.
I eat stir fry for breakfast 3 times a week. There is no cereal that compares. Plus I'm not hungry again in 2 hours.
I don't think anyone is eating sugary cereal for breakfast, it's usually like a sweet snack rather than a meal. 
This is true but generally we pull everything regardless of lot until given an all clear, and even if it did make it to the shelf somehow it won't ring up at the register. 

(Source: am grocery manager, have no Honey Smacks)
More than likely, but better safe than sorry.
Only criminals have illegal cereal.  How's that thug life?
I experimented with food poisoning this week and let me tell you, it didn't go well. I got mildly sick after a shrimp stir fry I made one night. Not sure if it was made me sick, I had leftovers the next night, and I've spent the past 48 hours in agony. Only now getting better.

I'd go for legal Frosted Flakes.
Gotta get them bootleg Smacks. 
You're not welcome here Dig Them!
Up and at them!
Please, Dig Them is his father. 
Dig we are Legion. 
Wait, Quick Draw McGraw was a Honey Smacks mascot? I need to reevaluate some things.
Many frogs dig into the ground and hibernate to survive the winter.
Funny how this happened right after the lab that does their safety testing was sold from Covance to Eurofins, eh?
Their literally amazing at keeping things quiet. They closed 39 distribution centers in 2017 and layed off over 11k workers. Most of the articles disappeared in less than 24 hours once they were posted, from both conservative and progressive news sources. 
I work in a convenience store chain that everyone here has probably shopped at one at least once. We had a recall issued about a month ago for all the honey smacks to be taken off the shelf with no other information. If someone managed to find one that we had missed, the registers had the item flagged and wouldn’t even add it to the transaction. It was keeping us from selling it even if we wanted to with no other information as to why.
AKA it's the poop.  The poop in the cereal is what's causing this.
Well their workers DO [Piss into their cereal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU3gg7QZ_ac)  
The FDA announced it on June 14th, not sure who it falls on to make sure the information is disseminated.  I received the email the day it was announced from the FDA.

https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm610815.htm

PSA: you can sign up for an email notification for FDA recall notices. 
So Kellogs was OK with more people getting salmonella  rather than taking it off the shelf?
We pulled ours off the shelf weeks ago.  Usually the instructions just tell us to mark through the  barcode and throw the box away.  This time it told us to dump the contents out of the box.  The county health inspector even came to stores to verify it was properly disposed of.  I've never heard of that happening in our county before.
I purchased some on Walmart.com and got a notification a month or so ago to trash my boxes. So I mean if you bought it online then you probably knew about it. 
Would you say that any cereal from kelloggs may not be safe due to this?
I would gild you if I could. Thank you for a clear explanation.
I’m surprised salmonella would survive in the bags. Don’t they not handle desiccation well (no endospores)? Or is there enough humidity in the bag? 
!Reddit Silver!
Even then, though, WTF are they doing in a *cereal* factory that it now has salmonella?
Don't get why they don't just blast the food with gamma radiation before it gets packaged.

Botulism is the concern when it comes to giving honey to infants. [Link](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/botulism.html).
Actually the main concern is clostridium botulinum, which is responsible for botulism.
Nope, you are thinking of a spore based sickness called botulism.

 https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23&ved=0ahUKEwjQndfTmZzcAhXjFJoKHbxgAPIQwqsBCDswAw&usg=AOvVaw0VTJzWxrN8ZFOD4xbU2nov
But they aren't adding anything. They're just demolishing regulations. Fuck public health and safety, those poor corporations need their profits! 
Republican logic:

We want govt that is SO small, it might as well not even be there. Unless we have children crossing our border. Then let's spend billions of dollars arresting, trying, imprisoning, and a PR team to squash public backlash for permanently damaging their mental health.
This is Bs the industry has never been safer, the fact that they are catching the issues as they pop up is what scares everyone but should let you know they are actually catching it. This isn’t big corporate bad guy. 
Well I only mentioned recent stuff but other produce has been contaminated too. Like the lettuce recall or the cucumbers. I just bought cereal for my kids and would be horrified to learn it can make them sick. Luckily it was fruit loops.
When you start saying that, you're just tempting fate to hand us this on a newspaper one day.

"Mad cow disease found in pepperoni used in fifteen brands of pizza sold in stores and chain restaurants.  You are all fucked, except those who ate at CiCi's.  They weren't using real pepperoni and may be the only time where that was a benefit."
You say that but I definitely got food poisoning from a frozen pizza a month or so ago.
Are the generic ones effected at all? They’re usually the same thing. 
I agree. Kelloggs's Smack remind me of my childhood. Devoured them out of the box. The only cereal I actually like.
It also makes your pee smell.
except actual honey is good for you and tastes about 10x better than processed, syrupy, artificial sugar they load by the gallon into children's cereal.

But our lizard brain doesn't really care as long as it's getting dat glucose hit
I don't think I'll be risking it then.
If you like other standard cereals you'll probably like it. It's one of the better ones IMO. I think that golden crisp is the better alternative though if you decide to give it a shot.
I think it tastes more like coffee than burnt popcorn. 
My favorite cereal. I know it’s nutritionally trash, but it’s so good. I found a diy recipe so I can make it slightly healthier. 
My thought after reading the title was "who the hell is eating these anyways?"
Frosted Flakes..correct me if wrong, are pure shit. The frost is just sugar. 
Ever try popcorn Styrofoam coated in sugar?  Sounds like a treat you might enjoy
My thoughts exactly
😢 at least I'll look good for beach season???? I'm dying.... 
2 slices of bread, honestly.
Oats and bread are much cheaper per calorie I think. Same with eggs too I'm fairly sure. 
I eat your mom's pussy for breakfast 3 times a week. There is no stir fry that compares. Plus I'm not hungry again in 2 hours
> I don't think anyone is eating sugary cereal for breakfast

What a bizarre claim.
You are wrong. Most kids eat cereal for breakfast in North America. 
Lol..you aren't form the U.S., are you? I grew up eating sugary cereal all the time...now I just can't do it except for like frosted mini wheats a few times a week. 
This is also true, but we’ve already been given the all clear and canceled the lockout at my store. I’m just trying to highlight how silly it is for the article to imply all Honey Smacks on shelves are “illegal” when new product has been made available. Something that should have come up with proper research.

Source: also grocery manager, can order Honey Smacks

Edit: just want to clarify I’m not trying to discredit the above comment, the product is probably being made available to stores on a rolling basis.
I mean, what percentage of sales are the Honey Smacks SKU for a grocery store anyway? Less than half a percent? Just take that shit off the shelves until the CDC says it’s okay, I’m sure the dozens of Honey Smacks buyers will find a suitable replacement until then

I'm so sick of you people blaming the poop.  Sometimes it's the severed body parts, did you ever think of that?!  No, you're so focused on your damn anti-fecal soapbox.
Kinda feel like malicious tampering with food safety should be a capital offense, might get it through to these morons the gravity of what they're doing.  People do die from food poisoning.
I have never been so relieved to not eat puffed rice.
> The FDA announced it on June 14th, not sure who it falls on to make sure the information is disseminated.

The press. But I've heard PR people and businessmen brag, in public while on their cell phones, about how great a job so-and-so public relations firm did at keeping something "quiet."

They leverage stuff reporters want (interviews, access to facilities for tours, review samples, being on the "people we call first about something" list, not being put on the "people we call last or never call about something") for favors like this.

Reporters are pretty principled when it comes to politics, court case coverage, etc...but they're **complete whores when it comes to business or "consumer" coverage.**
When profit is the #1 goal and corporations lobbying to change laws to limit liability and lawsuits, they have no concern about losing much in court.

Oddly enough, as it is a copacker it may be other things from the same plant that aren’t tied to Kellog’s that could be at risk.

Silly rabbit. Trix are for kids.
yeah i was also just going on a tangent and realizing how fragile our food  system actually is. 
I had them this morning so I hope not.
Usually not. Most generic stuff tastes the same nearly all the time, but is cheaper and cant have the same name or the same shape when it comes to lucky charms generic, for instance. No blue moons but plenty of blue squares or something.
I thought I was crazy!
I think burnt popcorn might be extreme. I actually enjoy honey snacks from time to time. I would liken the bitterness more to coffee in the sense that you get the sweet and a little bitter but it's in balance. I would actually say it's more on the insanely sweet end of the spectrum.
> It's one of the better ones IMO

Aside from all the diarrheas of course
You take that back frosted flakes are the bomb
I think it was pure sugar when I was a kid which is admittedly why I loved them so much probably - I tried them in my late 20's (about 5ish years ago), and it tasted so off. They've definitely changed the sweeteners in it. It was almost metallic tasting.
That would be cheaper but I’d be hungry after like 20 minutes. 

Not that cereal’s much better but it can be if you get the really grainy stuff. 
[deleted]
Man my mother is a gross bitch. Good luck with that.
Maybe you're right, but it's not very healthy. 
I am, and I too grew up eating cereal. I just don't personally know many people who eat sugary cereal for breakfast, nor do I know many parents that let their kids do so. It's usually like a treat unless something like mini wheets, or raisin bran. 
You think honey smacks makes up half a percent? Lol what
They were! I thought "well, I don't know for sure it made me sick and it was just mild sickness so let's see."

My friends have told me many, many times since then what an idiot I am, and I do have to agree. The second time eating the dish made me MUCH sicker.

Now, normally I would toss out even non-contaminated shrimp leftovers after a day or two, but I've been sick and haven't cleaned out the fridge. So there's a third and final portion of shrimp stir fry left. Getting food poisoning twice could be a coincidence, but if I ate that same dish a third time, in the name of scientific rigor...

Yeah, doesn't Kellogg's take the hit on the cost for every store? I wonder why some would keep it up... I guess extra $$$ but it's not like it's that expensive. 

My local store took it down immediately ... I would know since it's my favorite cereal. 
Product recall insurance is an insurance product that is sold to pakaging companies, so it might not do as much damage to their balance sheets as you'd think.  Might be tough to get coverage again though.
Ok, that's really interesting to know. I didnt realize that it worked like that. I literally just bought a few kellogg boxes yesterday (including honey smacks, haha) so at least I can salvage the rest.
Wow I thought otherwise. I only thought so because of a micro prof saying that when I was in school. He said you could wipe you counters with raw chicken, but as long as it dried it wouldn’t do harm, but now I suspect he was just assuming that for a colorful lecture.
That only raises *more* questions.

Why are factory-line workers manhandling their manager?

Who hired a chicken for management?!
[Other countries seem to manage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_irradiation)
Most generic stuff is the same factory, same ingredients, just different packaging.
So...2 slices whole wheat bread?
usually a loaf goes into about 10-12 slices, iirc.

Split it by 2s, and you have yourself 5-6 struggle meals.
Depends on which kinds, but ya people literally call it "breakfast cereal".  Just because you eat 4 bowls before bed doesn't mean people don't eat it in the morning 🙄
Tbf I did say “less than half”
You know that Darwin Awards don't come with monetary prizes, right?
[deleted]
Hopefully you saved some more so you can have one last try. Even if you have to scrape it out if the trash can. 
> but if I ate that same dish a third time, in the name of scientific rigor...

That's how you lose a kidney.  So maybe check with all your family and friends and ask them if they're willing to donate a kidney in the name of science! (And, because salmonella fucked yours up.)
[deleted]
Even if the manufacturer is bad, the product will be tested by an outside lab. If the product has salmonella it should be caught by the third party testing. The fact that it wasn’t may mean that the lab work was compromised, the testing wasn’t thorough enough. It could also simply mean the testing was actually clean. I am sure there is plenty of clean product within each batch.
Whoever told you that was probably just trying to make you feel better about eating that second tier shit.
With an egg and a sausage in between, sure. 
You would probably want something on your toast like butter or jam, though. 
Less than 50% tbh
Might as well say less than 95%, shieeeet
I should definitely Lysol my counters! I didn't even think of that. Granted, I'm still exhausted and mostly sticking to bed. Thank goodness grocery delivery is a thing, I got bland foods delivered to my door for the recovery period!

And strangely, I'm not even turned off by the thought of shrimp. I don't get it, as the two or three times in my life I've had food poisoning I couldn't eat that food or at that restaurant for years. Hell, I got food poisoning (I'm pretty sure) from a local Indian restaurant over five years ago and though I will readily eat Indian, I refuse to go back to that restaurant.
or have 2 slices of bread as a base, then put the sausage and egg on top.
That's if you toast it.

Although, butter and/or jam would cost close to $4, yet last a while.

Extra few cents.
[deleted]
That works. Might need a fork tho. 
Buttered bread probably fills you up way longer than cereal too.
I got the shrimp like half an hour before cooking it... though who knows how long it was sitting at the grocery store.

And some of it looked "different" than the rest. Like, some was bright and healthy looking and some look like it had wilted, if shrimp could wilt. I almost asked the guy to skip the shrimp because of that. Wish I would've! (Or, you know, not eaten it twice.)
Hasn't ever stopped the guys from r/putaneggonit
Wha?  Milk?
so, they're the first to diss liberals who, in their view, whine a lot.... and then they cry like little babies when an organization pulls advertising? wtf?
"It's un-American" Breitbart says, in their continued misunderstanding of what makes America... America. Freedom of choice.
As others have pointed out, Kellogg's is suddenly pulling their campaign NOW? What about the shit Breitbart has posted WHILE Kellogg's was advertising?
[deleted]
They have now created their own brands that include favorites like alt-right crispies, racist bran, hate nuts, and asshole jacks.
And that's another way to tell the difference between a legit news source and a fake news source. 
You know, boycotting Kellogg isn't such a bad thing. They're a big proponent of Palm Oil and all the controversies connected to that industry such as child labor, deforestation, and extinction/endangering wild animals such as the orangutan. If you guys want to defend Kellogg I'd advise against that. 
[deleted]
A team at Kelloggs made the business decision that advertising with them would cost them more money than a boycott by the demographic that cares about this.

The invisible hand at work.
[removed]
This is a company exercising their right in a free market. An ideaology that your conservate-leaning site espouses. Go fuck yourself, Breitbart.
it's a globalist conspiracy 
So Kellogg's values are child labor. And Breitbart doesn't fit those values. I think that's a compliment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5fwcby/firms_such_as_kelloggs_unilever_and_nestlé_use/
Since when did the right become bigger whiners then the liberals they mock? They're a company and can do what they want, remember? Stop crying and worry about real problems. 
I'd rather people were angry at Kellogg's for profiting off child slaves but ok I guess. 
This seems really idiotic. Who would want to advertise for such an unprofessional outfit? Good luck finding new advertisers, Breitbart.
Who cares?
I already get the impression that loyal Breitbart readers don't eat Kellogg's cereals anyway, preferring instead a glass of their own urine in the morning.
The Alt-Reich is butt hurt about a lack of fiber it seems.
A boycott for a boycott. I don't eat their cereal or read their news, so I don't care. 
I'd rather people were angry at Kellogg's for profiting off child slaves but ok I guess. 
I have to say that prior to Trump rallying for Brannon, I hadn't heard of Breitbart, but I don't pay much attention to the media.  This just makes them look even more pathetic.
   I am more amused at the number that Bannon et al is claiming to have as follower's.   If true, why do they hide that information from public view?

This will do wonders for future advertising revenue.
Aw, Breitbart needs a safe-space.

So two companies boycotting each other?  It's a conglomerate cat fight!
It is apparent most of these comments posted did not take the time to actually read Kellogg's statement. If they had it shows Kellogg's explaining they do not feel associated with 50 million Americans beliefs. Kellogg's stock will plummet over the statements jut watch
Um okay so one company boycotts them and they call for a boycott of that company?

What exactly is the problem here? I mean I guess it's news but there's not much to discuss. 
The ability for the average Breitbart watcher to afford brand name cereal will be lost as soon as the GOP strips their WIC, SNAP, Medicaid and Social Security. So in reality, the demographic doesn't make sense for Kellogg aside from disagreeing with xenophobic stances. 
Any comment from Stephen The Red Nosed Racist on this deliberate attempt to paint haters as haters?
I feel like this a great use of any extra energy a Breitbart reader needs to burn off.
Who is still advertising on Breitbart, I want to know so I can boycott them.
So I should buy as much Kellogg's as I possibly can is what you are telling me....
Aren't these the same people who support bakeries who won't bake for homosexual weddings on moral grounds? Perhaps they are learning that it doesn't feel so good when someone returns that favor. 
Their response really legitimizes the decision to pull out.
This is how you end fake news. Remove the profit motive.
just now kelloggs realized this?  what changed in the past week?
Don't care for Breitbart. But what exactly are kellogg''s values??? [False advertising?](https://www.google.com/amp/naturalsociety.com/kelloggs-kashi-brand-to-pay-4-million-over-all-natural-false-advertising-lawsuit/amp/?client=ms-android-verizon)

Although the biggest lie of all is that frosted wheats are tasty.
i didnt know about breitbart until now. i've seen a few articles by them before this. they have serious user participation. each article has thousands of comments. 99% of users don't have a face photo. it's like an anonymous hate machine but they're too scared to stand behind it. almost every article is written to scratch a conservative itch or reaffirm a belief.
Nobody should be aligned with Breitbart's shit values, fuck the companies who still support it.
Didn't Kellogg just get busted for using child labour?  So000, 
Right-wing news = bad...
Child labour = good?
Breitbart were the ones championing how gamergaters successfully pulled ads from gaming news sites, so it seems pretty hypocritical that they should complain when the same tactic is used against them. Turnabout is fair play. 
Maybe we can put these [Breitbart "headlines"](http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/14/media/breitbart-incendiary-headlines/) on the back of a box of frosted flakes...Thererrrrrrr Greeeeeaat!

 **'The solution to online 'harassment' is simple: Women should log off'**

A article in July argued that women are "screwing up the internet for men by invading every space we have online and ruining it with attention-seeking and a needy, demanding, touchy-feely form of modern feminism."

**'Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew'**

A post in May described a "third party effort to block Trump's path to the White House" that Breitbart claimed was orchestrated by the prominent conservative and Trump critic Bill Kristol. The headline is one of the site's most infamous, and was featured this fall in a Democratic political ad.

**'Trannies whine about hilarious Bruce Jenner billboard'**

A December 2015 article criticized a campaign to take down a billboard mocking Caitlyn Jenner after she went public with her transition last year. "Transsexuals have forced a company in New Zealand to take down a billboard poking fun at Bruce Jenner and his man-parts," the article said.

**'Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy'**

A December 2015 article made a case against birth control and concluded, "We need the kids if we're to breed enough to keep the Muslim invaders at bay." The article was one of many blasted by critics of Breitbart. 


**TL;DR.....You wouldn't want your kids reading a box of cereal with this crap on the back so you probably don't want them reading this crappy website either.**
Well guess I'll be buying cases of Kellogg's cereals for the food bank. 
Should serve as a warning to anyone thinking of advertising there -- if you stop, they'll call for a boycott on your product!
Kellogg's is looking mighty fucking tasty right now. Fuck Bannon and Robert Mercer.
Great idea for attracting new advertisers... boycott anyone who stops doing business with you.  I'm sure the Klan would love to advertise their costumes on your site.
Kellogg's for the next 4 years it is, then.
Kellogg's: *Sweet... free advertising...*
Pull advertising from Breitbart and they call for a boycott on your product. I am sure other companies are lining up to place their own ads now.....
Historically when the right wing boycott a product or a group, said product or group usually does much better.

Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran sounds pretty good right now. Or some healthy alternatives. Time to support those that refuses to do business with white nationalist and propaganda news sites.
My money is on Breitbart winning this fight, and Kellogg apologizing.



Pretty sure their bread and butter of American sales from from middle America where people consume their processed sugary shitty food. Middle america is also not doing great financially so monitor their purchases, and feel embattled by aggressive and judgemental democrats.


You don't have to read Breitbart to feel like this is an assault on Trump & his supporters values. That's how it's going to be spun, and Kellogg will continue to tank - unless of course the people who came flying in to set record high purchases for Hamilton tickets suddenly develop an affinity for cocopuffs and pop tarts.
> boycott on Kellogg’s

They're a little late.  There's been a Kellogg's boycott since their poor treatment of Michael Phelps (US Olympic swimmer / bong-ripper)


That's a great way to attract new companies to advertise on your site. 

Join up now! but if you ever leave, we will boycott you! ^Wait ^where ^are ^you ^going?
The ever-adolescent alt-right at it again.
Well I guess the Old American Capitalism machine sucks when it's sights are set on you.
I think I might just boycott them, actually. Simply for the fact that it's FUCKING CEREAL GETTING POLITICAL!!!!
Perhaps Kelloggs should put toy swastikas in the cereal box like they used to in the old days (except not swastikas). That would probably make Breitbart happy.
I feel sorry for the idiots that are going to buy kellogg's products now just because they want to feel smug about the boycott; those cereals are pretty crap.  "alt-right boycotts poison", drink up I guess?

I go for Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds, personally.
I will buy a Kellogg's product for the first time in my life because of this.
Let Kellogg's have their freedom to choose.
Don't boycott people just because they won't give you money, that's fucked up.  Hey wait, no, this makes sense.  Breitbart, give me money or I'm going to organize a boycott against you!
[removed]
maybe they should get a tank to declare war "on high prices" like in Family Guy

Guess I'll stop eating Breitbart in retaliation. 

I was expecting another year of "War on Christmas". A war on breakfast cereal was not what I expected.
Wow, did the guardian just admit that gamergate is more than just a hate movement? 

Holy shit. 
The obvious solution to this is to boycott all companies that advertise on Breitbart.
Aren't these guys for corporate self determination though?
Time to buy some Frosted Flakes.  
I don't think the business of *"If you pull advertising from our side we will organize a boycott against you"* will get them too many new customers.
I guess I'm going to start eating cereal in support of this. Rice crispies, I guess.
Wow... out of curiosity this made me go and visit Breitbart.

Now I wish mind bleach was a thing
Time to buy some Kellogg's Cereal?
I'll be honest I wouldn't want to boycott Kellogg's lol.  Wouldn't want to say goodbye to Pringles

http://www.kelloggcompany.com/en_US/brandportfolio.html/


I don't know about anybody else, but *I* started to write a very polite email to every one of the advertisers I see on Breitbart. Something along the lines that by advertising the views (Racism, xenophobia, white supremacist, neo-nazi, misogynistic) expressed on Breitbart also seem to be the views of XXXX. I believe if the support organizations get more of those emails companies would revert course and we hurt Breitbart where it hurts most (in their pocketbook)
Breibart decides to start making their [OWN cereal](http://imgur.com/gallery/Fh3cS)
*Make America Grrrrrreeeat! again*
New headline:

**Fake News Site Breitbart Vows to "Really Fake News at Kellogs a Lot"**
"They're just words! Haha losers with your safe space"

"We don't think you share our values so we're not going to advertise on your site any longer." 

"WTF YOU GUYS DONT LIKE US REEEEEEEE THIS IS WHY TRUMP GOT ELECTED" 
Why in holy fuck did Kellog's EVER advertise on Breitbart in the first place?
Kellogg's is a pretty large and enshrined conglomerate, that's a hell of a fight to needlessly pick with someone who did it in a formal professional manner.
I am going to stock up on Kellogg products.
So basically they have announced to the rest of their advertisers that they are running a racket?
I like how their page has a huge photo of kelloggs cereal on it right now and like 5 different headlines talking about kelloggs.  Might as well give them some free advertising before the boycott starts
Especially when they're all "fuck Le government, go capitalism" 

This is what capitalism looks like 
When liberals do it they are crying like little babies.  When alt-right does it they are fighting the power.  This is their worldview.
They got Cocoa Cucked
I think they got triggered lul 
But, but, mah free market!
See: Limbaugh, Rush
Maybe we should find out if they need a safety pin
I see your point, but I think from their perspective this is a return fire thing. The whole situation is hoppycock, if you ask me. This whole divided we stand crap is getting old. 

I look at it like this; you knew our position before you signed up, why the sudden change? Cheap PR tactic? Second, if it's in the contract they can back out, that's what you signed. You made the deal, sometimes it's the way it goes. Don't make yourself look bad in the process. 

I just wish 2016 would be over already.
Go to their front page and at least half the articles are about Kellogg. Glad they aren't butt hurt over being dissed.
Psychological projection 
they're hacks and racist pieces of shit anyhow - why even waste your breath over a cancerous organization - they seek to divide and inspire hate and self doubt - fuck those guys.
I don't know why anyone is surprised that Breitbart is boycotting a breakfast product, given it's well-documented hostility towards the juice
People will always become hypocrites when their paycheck is on the line. I've seen websites that willing nuke their comment section complain of censorship when advertisers pull. Now conservatives who complain about overly sensitive personal outrage are outraged.

Hit someone in the wallet to see how true their values are.
A boycott is actual action tho 
The blind man doesn't see a reflection.
Ironic, right? The ones who bitch about safe spaces the most, are the ones who need it the most.
There's a difference:  Their asking their readers to boycott the brand - they aren't asking the government to step in and do something about it.  That's actually the exact point of capitalism: Vote with your dollars.  They aren't saying Kellogs *can't* do it, or shouldn't be allowed to pull ads, they're making the point that it's a poor business decision to play politics.
But freedom from choice is what you want.
People *outside of Breitbart* have found out Breitbart exists.  Previously they were so far under the radar it didn't matter if you advertised there, only their loyal fanbase would know.  
Breitbart hadn't yet kept out of the footnotes of the history books before the election. Before the election Breitbart were just like "oh yeah and they were they guys who were behind this and that nasty thing", but now that Bannon is in the Whitehouse there will probably be an entire chapter in the history books about Breitbart before they close up shop.
All that talk about stopping illegal immigration is actually bearing fruit, and that's bad news for an agriculture based company that makes bank off of illegal immigrant workers.
[deleted]
Web advertising has a few more layers than that.
Most companies have no idea where their shit is advertised. 

As some people have alluded to, Kellogg's uses a third-party company to handle web advertising on sites like Breitbart and as such probably doesn't pay much attention to which sites are used within certain broad categories. For instance, they probably don't advertise on porn sites, but they do advertise on media sites. But which media sites specifically is probably outside their concern, until now. Also, it's poor business to pull advertising for anything less than major ideological disagreements. They probably wouldn't pull advertising from the WSJ just because of an editorial that their CEO disagrees with. Clearly, however, their issues with Breitbart have reached that threshold.
Maybe they'd already paid for it up til now.  They may have figured most people weren't going to take the "when" into consideration when they evaluate their pull out and decided to get what they paid for first before making a statement.  A calculated business decision.
As long as you don't mind sharing ad space with my brand, Honey Bunches of Final Solution.

Unfortunately their readers simply dont care. They have an "us VS. them" mentality, and they are going to do anything they can to harm "the other side".

They dont really care about right or wrong, just about winning. Its like a sport to them. 
I never actually read Breitbart articles, but their headlines suggest to me that they're Heavily Editorialized articles that have some basis in a real story.

That would be different the "Fake News" issue that everyone's talking bout today, because that "Fake News" is literal fiction based off of fiction.  
After the election I 100% trust Breitbart more than CNN or MSNBC
i like kellogs tho they make good serial
Wait, there's a legit news outlet in existence? Where you must tell me.
4 Use Child labor to make sure share holders are happy with their cut.
Doesn't include "assist in creating concentration camps for enemies of the alt-right" or "drawing swastikas on burnt down churches", so no wonder they don't support brietbart.
Thanks to this I now know about the child labor thing *and* their willingness to play politics in order to distract from it, soooo...
[deleted]
About 20 million Americans visit breitbart monthly.
Yo before we jump on this, have Kellogs been involved in any questionable acts? I'm not talking about generic lobbying for lower taxes, or to keep other businesses away. I mean Nestle-tier shit. I just want to be sure.
Children make tasty cereal. 
Enjoy getting fat. Virtually all their stuff has the sugar content of candy, and the rest of the material is refined grains or corn (which is even worse than grain).
Kellog used child slave labor though...

You're sure showing Braitbart
Yeah...hate trump and become a hypocrite by helping to fund child labor, deforestation, palm oil, and endangerment of wild animals such as the orangutan. At least ACT educated before you put your face to the keyboard.
Same, but also, do they expect people to buy General Mills? 
Buy it and drop it in the food donation box.
So cheap child labor doesn't bother you???
I typically don't eat Kellogg's but I bet they have something I like - Breitbart is scum.
Isn't a boycott exercising their right in a free market?
Um isn't breitbart exercising their right too?
The best part is if they complain about this they must not really like capitalism all that much 
I don't get Breitbart and their fans. They love free market capitalism, but hate globalism? Shouldnt companies be free to outsource if they want? 
Since always, I think.  
Honestly, always. Look at Obamas entire presidency. It was nothing but "Obummer is a Kenyan muslim who hates America and wants to impose marital law an steal your guns." 

Most on the right literally don't know why they hate Obama. Every reason I've heard has always been completely nonsensical. 
How is boycotting a product "crying"? 

There are plenty of companies I personally boycott because I don't like the way they do things.

Sony has traditionally produced products that had proprietary formats or protocols and deviated from open standards. So I don't buy anything Sony.

Adobe software has always been bloated and extremely invasive in terms of all the services and agents it installs, so I don't buy or promote anything Adobe.

If I do the same with Kellogg for political reasons it's crying?
[removed]
I don't think anyone should be eating kellogg's cereal. Unless of course you like deforestation, palm oil, child labor, and the endangerment of animals like the orangutan? you can go ahead and buy Kellogg's cereal! 
It's PURE! 
Do you live in this country?
As opposed to Breitbart collective which wants to bring slavery back, but I guess ok. Derp derp derp 
This is probably one of the best and most serious points on this thread.  No advertiser is going to want to advertise through Breitbart if they know they will be boycotted and publicly ridiculed if they ever change their minds.
I remember the wailing and screaming and tears whenever *gasp!* marriage equality happened. 

Heaven forbid tax paying Americans got equal rights. That was a travesty in their eyes. 


[deleted]
Actually, the boycott is designed to push the child labor scandal out of the public's mind.


The boycott is the invented news, designed to push the real news out of the news cycle.


TLDR: It's all fake news.
Most companies don't know the sites that they advertise to and almost no news sites actually handle their own advertisements online. It's all done with a middleman in the form of an ad service. So what changed is that Kellogg's got emails telling them to pull their ads, which they then told that ad service to blacklist the offending site.
How did you miss the child slave labor
They are just making free ad for themselves by jumping anti-Republican/Trump train.
> Although the biggest lie of all is that frosted wheats are tasty.


Pour enough sugar on it and anything is tasty to a six-year-old.

Almost some sort of 'Internet Hate Machine" if you will.

It's the right's version of HuffPo, Vox, Salon, etc.  They present news from a certain point of view.

And the people. 
Kinda like how Apple 'cares' about people's privacy but their companies are slave labor sweatshops that they have to install a literal net outside of to keep it's "employees" from killing themselves.
But they are using the same tactic in response... so whoevers bottom line gets hurt the most loses?

Corn flakes are gross.

"No! Subsidize our intolerance!"

This right wing "economic nationalism" is just a form of subsidization. Let's subsidize manufacturers to stay in the U.S. and produce their products less efficiently! Let's subsidize the failing coal industry so coal workers don't have to be uncomfortable with the fact that their job is obsolete. Let's halt all forward progress so we can create an economic vacuum and nobody ever has to learn new skills!
> "fuck Le government, go capitalism"

Prepare for the fucktards on Facebook to start crying about how Kellogg's is trying to limit free speech, blah blah blah.
This comment is exactly as true when flipped. Whining in general is the go to response for media attention and it accomplishes nothing.
Top story in the world today:  "One of our advertisers left waaaah."
This is the all-encompassing tactic of the right.
I have no idea what this joke means
I'm strange... I happen to like choice.
Within Kelloggs, there is a marketing department, and they probably don't care about what the media outlet is - just its size.

Then one day, the CEO goes there because it's in the news, and goes... "WTF?!?  Rice Krispies and Racism?"

More likely than not how it went down.
Lol so it's okay to associate my country with neo Nazis as long as they aren't popular?
I also want frosted flakes. Besides, if this was a marketing move they deserve it working.
Right, I would like to go right out and buy a whole lot of Kellogg's to repudiate this boycott. Unfortunately it's all unhealthy. So how can Breitbart say Kellogg's is un-American?
If someone in marketing doesn't know where the third parties are advertising, they should be fired. It is their job to manage the third parties and know before a program is on place.
Third reich krispies. 
Um, breakfast is the most important meal of the day in America.

What are you? Some godless commie muslim?
Didn't you hear? Kelloggs invented corn flakes to curb masturbation.
Breitbart demands all cereals be WHITE & FLAKY! Milos bringing the bananas!

Sounds like the wonderful 2 party system I've grown to love (hate). 
"their readers" "they have" "they are" "they can" "they don't" "to them" good point
So their demographic is LEOs?
>> They have an "us VS. them" mentality

I wonder who give them that idea (Hint: Hillary)
Been thinking about this. Really think this goes back to the civil war with them. The us vs them mentality. They member truly got over it.
that's the thing though - I have a number of people in my FB feed talking about breaking away from reading "fake news" sources, and one of them is swearing off NPR and BBC and sticking with Breitbart, Infowars, and Project Veritas.
"The left" meaning 98% of Reddit's userbase - love to discredit stories based on the URL alone. I've found it impossible to link some stories because they simply aren't covered by the kind of news outlets they would accept.

I linked to [this](http://bearingarms.com/bob-o/2014/06/20/radio-show-host-wants-trick-police-killing-open-carriers/) yesterday. The person I sent it to immediately said that my link was invalid specifically because it was a pro-gun site. That was the entirety of his objection.

Except... the story links out to the exact quote of the radio host. No wait, it actually is the audio recording of his show. Meaning the story is completely true. It's not even like they cherry-picked one sentence out of context, they even provided the whole quote.

Is it editorialized? Yes, bearingarms.com is a blog, not a newspaper.

Will you find this story covered in **any** left-leaning website? Absolutely NOT.

Which means that to these people locked in their echo chambers, the story literally didn't happen. It was all made up. FEELS > REALS. Ironically this happened in the same story yesterday about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5fjujh/kellogg_pulls_ads_from_breitbart_amid_hatespeech/damgy8p/

Serial:  one at a time; single file

Cereal:  a breakfast food
Almost as good as that Sarah chick.
I know you are just being sarcastic but the BBC, NPR, Washington Post, and New York Times are all fantastic news sources. Also I generally find the written news stories online for CNN or Fox to be adequate for breaking news, as long as you aren't looking for nuance and you realize that they are focusing on speed over accuracy. 
That's just, like, your opinion, man
BBC is pretty good. I saw leftists accusing them of being "super conservatives" during the Scottish independence business and I see right wingers accuse them of being "left wing commies", I wager theyre pretty balanced if they piss off both sides.

Just slave labor nothing unusual. 
Well, if you are an American man, the founder of Kellogg's, [John Harvey Kellogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention), is the reason your are circumcised, it was meant to prevent boys from masturbating!
Kelloggs was originally called the  Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, and its founder John Harvey Kellogg was a bit of a nut. We was against sex and was the founder of the anti-mastabatory movement. 

He literally thought that feeding children cereal would lead to them stopping self-abuse aka masterbating. 

Oh, and he also started the Race Betterment Foundation that was basically eugenics. 

 
What about Quaker Oatmeal? I feel sure you can always trust a Quaker.
For a laugh, watch "The Road to Wellville" with Anthony Hopkins as Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, inventor (co-inventor?) of the corn flake. 
From what I've heard proctor and gamble use pus to make pringles so I avoid them.
you like deforestation, palm oil, child labor, and the endangerment of animals like the orangutan? you can go ahead and buy Kellogg's cereal! 
you like deforestation, palm oil, child labor, and the endangerment of animals like the orangutan? you can go ahead and buy Kellogg's cereal! 
> but I bet they have something I like 

Child labor?
They're supposed to be a news organization. How are they ever going to write an unbiased piece about Kellog now? It doesn't work when your product is information.
Sure, but explaining how exactly Kellogg actions are "un-American" would be nice. 
Ssh, no, shut up. Breitbart is bad because they're on the *right*. 
Who pooped in their cereal!?
Fascists have a history of disliking capitalism. 
Because they were told to.
You seem to have legitimate, impersonal reasons for your "boycotts," and to be quite honest I can understand and even agree with them. But then, I put "boycotts" in scare quotes because, to stick with honesty, those aren't so much boycotts as consumer decisions based on projected utility. That, in effect, is my interpretation of it.

With that being said, Breitbart is definitely "crying". There's no utilitarian need to call for a boycott of Kellogg products, only a personal, and emotionally immature one. While Kellogg's pullout is pragmatic, Breitbart's reaction is purely retaliatory, and meaningless.... and depends entirely on telling others what to do.
oh fuck off, you've never even read breitbart 
Show me where they said "were bringing back slavery!"
If you're going to pretend you have the moral high ground you shouldn't tell blatant lies, it's not going to win anybody over
You've obviously never read breitbart if you think they're pro slavery you utter moron 
[removed]
Yeah it blows my mind that "the users are anonymous and don't show their faces!" has become a *criticism* of a web platform now.

On the internet I grew up on that was the whole fucking point.
Don't have to pick which is worse. Kelloggs buying palm oil from providers who utilize slave labour is horrible. Doesn't mean Breitbart isn't a neonazi cesspool of dumbfucks
Not sure, have never tried it.  Will probably give that a shot since you mentioned it, and find out.
Has anyone said Breitbart readers shouldn't be allowed to boycott? Absolute straw man argument here. 
Obviously sticking it to a right leaning site is more important than some stupid child slaves

I boycott companies all the time... It's how capitalism works.
That's what /u/Agastopia is saying.
I think a lot of businesses will be looking at "getting boycotted by bigots" as a solid business practice to improve employee morale, and get unprofitable, time wasting, whiny complaining customers to remove themselves, 
Just posted that. I literally saw this story on the front page and the child labor story right below it. People are defending Kellogg's here. Cognitive Dissonance much?
Taking the chance (a pretty good one) that Frightfart is never going to bring up the child labor issue. 
I agree subsidizing businesses to stay in the US isn't the right answer, but why should the US allow unrestricted trade with countries that can undercut our production costs due to a lack of environmental and worker protections?
Increased efficiency has been the cover story for replacing US jobs for several decades now. I don't mind paying more to get my products made, if not in the US, in a country that I know doesn't employ children for example. It was manufacturing jobs, soon it'll be tech (things like HB1) and they'll be screaming just as loudly.  
> alternet, democracyNow, rollingstone

How are those extremist?
You're lumping in Breitbart, Infowars and RT with *Stormfront?*

Wow. You realize how ridiculous you sound? 
Great place to advertise guns and other self defense stuff. A lot of these nuts feel an over need to protect themselves.
There was a thread about them using child labor. Idk if people missed that. 

Right now it sucks to be Kelloggs. Politically active people from both ends of the spectrum will boycott for different reasons. 

I love the blood and sweat of Asian children on my frosted flakes tho foreal.
Isn't the free speech still there, it would just have to be self funded or new advertising be found to pay for it?
Gives you an idea of how big their world is.
Reich Krispies?
Their ad buys are handled by multiple third parties. The marketing group tells an agency what the general direction and goals are. The agency finds a demo that works for them, designs a bunch of ads for them, then buys space where that demo views content. Things are never managed at the micro level, it would be impossible to approve/disapprove of every site. 
I've worked at Kellogg's and you would be surprised at some of the things they tried to [market] (https://www.google.ca/search?q=batman+kellogg+special&rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA707CA707&hl=en-US&prmd=inv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyzr_I7dLQAhUGOSYKHVnBCiEQ_AUIBygB&biw=320&bih=492#imgrc=1C2CJ8B9BleRIM%3A). I think this just comes down to the fact that selling breakfast cereal that may potentially suffocate mouth-breathers puts Kellogs at risk for a class-action lawsuit.  IMO
I picture him spitting out his corn flakes.
It's probably simpler than that.  They probably just make bundled ad buys through a third party marketer who advertises on many sites.
I think you're missing the point of having an advertising contractor. The contractor says "we'll put your product on x, y and z **type** of websites" and Kellogg's agrees. Kellogg's knows that it's being advertised on some types of sites and isn't on other types. If Kellogg's wanted to keep track of the thousands of individual sites, it wouldn't use the contractor. And when Kellogg's comes to the realization that one of the sites it's being advertised on is incompatible with its corporate values, it tells the contractor not to use that site. Which is what happened here.

But I guess none of that is as much fun as being outraged and calling for someone to be fired.
Gives a whole new meaning to "Snap Crackle Pop".
That's wrong, so very wrong...
And remember, cereals are part of a balanced breakfast (as long as you include the balanced breakfast along with it).

When even Kellogg's finds Brietbart's practices questionable, then you just *know* they must be into some pretty fucked up shit.
John Harvey Kellogg was the anti-masturbation extremist who invented breakfast cereal for his Michigan sanitarium, but his brother Will Keith Kellogg started the food company. J. H. Kellogg was one of many anti-masturbation extremists in US medical history, but he was not the most influential. The most influential of the early genital surgery activists were [Johnathan Hutchinson, Peter Remondino, Lewis Sayre and Edwin H. Pratt](https://reddit.com/r/Intactivists/wiki/index#wiki_19th_century). [Sayre](http://www.cirp.org/library/history/gollaher/) was the first president of the American Medical Association who recommended circumcision as a cure for epilepsy and paralysis for most of his career before quietly recanting. Remondino's *History of Circumcision* manufactured a false but very flattering and unfortunately influential history of circumcision. [Hutchinson](http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=25#content) was a prolific British doctor who recommended castration as the next step should circumcision fail to prevent masturbation. And in his prime, Pratt's [Orificial Surgical Society](http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392149) counted thousands of doctors all over the United States as members. Today they're more likely to be remembered for advocating routine circumcision for girls as well as boys. 

Anti-masturbation/anti-foreskin rhetoric was not only popular in the US. Routine/non-therapeutic circumcision also became popular in the UK from the 19th century until the 1960s sexual revolution killed the tradition ([Darby, 2005](https://books.google.com/books?id=sD6CALS2NtQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PR3)).
1) it probably isn't. Circumcision has been pretty widely used for decades, plus it probably happened a fair bit even before him.

2) Eh. The man is long dead. 
> circumcised, it was meant to prevent boys from masturbating!

Didn't work.
Well jokes on him I still beat my meat on the daily!
>  it was meant to prevent boys from masturbating!

He failed miserably.
Has nothing to do with Quakers.
>How are they ever going to write an unbiased piece about Kellog now?

If anyone says that Breitbart has tried to be an unbiased news organization before now they're either a liar or a fool.  I fail to see how a boycott changes that one way or another.  Like it or not a boycott is still them exercising their economic muscle.
Didn't that ship sail when kellogg pulled out of advertising?
>They're supposed to be a news organization. How are they ever going to write an unbiased piece about Kellog now? It doesn't work when your product is information.


........As opposed to when Kellogs was writing them checks?......
ok show me an unbiased new org
I have, and he has a great point. Read any breitbart comment and you will immediately realize the entire site panders to neonazis and white supremacists. 

Edit: I just checked you comment history, point proven. You whine about "the blacks" and "the muslims" in half your posts. Color me surprised ;)
Pretty sure it's in the fine print. Blah blah blah All hail the great orange pumpkin. 
It's worked for Trump so far.
They are though. Truth hurts I guess.
All the Jews that write for Breitbart are Nazis?
Not that they shouldnt' be allowed but there seems to be a general sentiment that what Kellogg did was okay and what breitbart did wasn't and it's the same thing. 
Boycotts are the free market solution though.  If they were calling for any kind of government intervention then it'd be hypocritical.
No. He is pro-free market. This is the beauty of free market. You don't ask government to stop an organization you're against, you do it yourself. Everything is pro-freemarket until you ask government regulators to step in. Being against a business in no way translates to being against the free market.
What does a boycott have to do with being anti-free market?
I disagree that there is hypocrisy. The free market inherently means making choices over competing products, and a free consumer can take anything they desire into account. Kelloggs is choosing not to purchase a good from breitbart (advertising). Breitbart is responding by recommending its readers choose not to purchase goods from Kelloggs. Consumers have complete free will in either respect, they can choose whether or not they value breitbart's position. In fact this is exactly how the free market should work. Breitbart is self interested, as all consumers and producers are (theoretically) self interested in the free market. 
Could also be that instead of quietly pulling the ads they decided to make a public statement about it and this is the public statement back.


yup me too. that's what I'm saying. it's why I don't buy nestle products or products that use palm oil

In a more serious response:

Thanks to /u/carrotcatnip

Kellogg uses palm oil from a company called Wilmar that was recently reported as using child labor in Indonesia by Amnesty International.

Kellogg gave a detailed response to Amnesty and their steps in the past to rectify labor issues and their future plans to do so.  

https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5230/2016/en/

They also have their own webpage detailing their past and future plans.

Kellogs with orphan tears. Mmmmmmm....
I wouldn't have known that. Interesting. 
All I see in this whole thread is how Kellogg's uses child labor. That's not quite accurate. They, along with Colgate-Palmolive, Nestle, and Procter and Gamble all source from the company Wilmar. Wilmar is the one taking advantage of child labor.

Probably, Wilmar has all those clients because they can afford to sell cheap because of those child labor advantages. So, if Kellogg's doesn't pressure Wilmar to completely reform its practices, or if Wilmar doesn't reform and then Kellogg's refuses to switch suppliers, then we can all hop on a Kellogg's hate train.

Yeah, it's pretty shitty, and it wouldn't surprise me if somebody somewhere turned a blind eye, but let's keep a little perspective. It's not like Kellogg's is directly running child slavery operations somewhere.

Ironically, this is what the free market gets you. Wilmar does something shady to get the lowest prices compared to competitors, and their lowest prices attract all these big-name corporate entities to use them as a suppler because of a focus on the bottom line.
Funny and original. I love it. 
Holy shit that burns like a thousand suns.

Everyone calls out the media on the other side for being fake, or making a big deal over nothing, yet ignore the fact that the media on 'their side' is doing the same thing to them, and baiting them into also getting pissed off over basically nothing.
Sure, but the two sides are not equivalent.
It goes both ways but I fear for my (online) safety when I criticize the Trump supporters. 

It's like my feelings for Cheney but now realizing he's the president. That's my fear level for Trump. 

But hey I might be totally wrong and his 24D chess game is going to bring in the new enlightenment. Or something.  I actually have no idea what his administration stands for. 
Oh please do enlighten.
Journalist here (not for any of the orgs mentioned). Take my opinion as you will, but he named some excellent news agencies. I would be satisfied if a stranger named any one of those as their primary news source (except CNN and Fox, but he's right that Fox's online articles are often adequate). You should seriously question where your dislike of them comes from -- whether it's from real, provable issues with their reporting, or from politicians and ideologues who want to discredit respected sources of journalism. 
I was just being facetious.
Kellog's is enslaving white American conservative children and working them to death in factories.

Hillary Clinton is behind it all.  First the whole Democratic National Committee rapes the kids at a pizza place, then they take them to the Kellog's plant to make cereal.
More like Kellogg found a way to get gullible Democrats to look past child labor abuses.

’struth. I checked their website. Not one duck on the Board of Directors.
Even Andrew Breitbart himself was a proponent of adversarial journalism.
Most reputable sites will 1) disclose links between them and the subject ("this is our parent company," "this company advertises with us") and 2) separate their editorial staff from their 'business' staff (their reporters, editors, etc. have little contact with the marketing and sales people, so they don't influence each other's decisions).
No, the onus is on the journalist to document and work to avoid bias. This is why any reputable news organization will disclose any conflicts of interest that exist between the target of a news story and the news source. 
You know that's a false equivalency. Show me a mainstream news organization as biased as Breitbart. 
"Perfectly unbiased" isn't possible. But that doesn't mean all news agencies are equally biased. Some, like the NYTimes, NPR, BBC, Economist or Washington Post, strive much harder to present things in an unbiased manner. Others, like Huffington Post, Fox and Breitbart, are *much* more slanted towards one side. You can't dismiss *all* news organizations just because none of them are *absolutely perfect*.
No such thing as entirely unbiased, but places like NPR, PBS, the BBC, the Economist, the New York Times, and the Washington Post generally try to disclose their potential conflicts of interest and to avoid bias whenever possible. 
So no. You haven't found it and it hasn't been said. But I guess you know better than everyone. Derp Derp derp.
Match point goes to /u/Fred_Evil 
Dude you are not helping the political divide.
Breitbart is pretty much saying "Boycotts are great as long as you're not boycotting us, because nobody should boycott us."
> Boycotts are the free market solution though.

Still, what motivates their anger and the boycott doesn't align with their apparent support of the free market and capitalism. If they were consistent, perhaps they would understand why it makes sense for a large company to chose not to advertise with them. 
But Buttfart is the goverment now.
There are 3 elements to a free market. The first is in deed government non intervention but the second and third, unlimited competition and perfect consumer information are on the list as well.

Advertising or in this case anti advertising goes against number 3. Consumers need to make dispassionate choices based solely on the merits of the product. Selling ads is anti free market. Bitching about someone not buying your adds is also anti free market.

No one wants a real free market. Corporations want copyrights and patents, consumers want consumer protection and everyone wants the government to intervene when someone is in breach of contract.

The second you let the government handle even one of these things, you get a regulated market that only get's more regulated over time as people realise that what they actually wanted was to get rid of rules, regulation and government intervention where it goes against them and to add more where it's in their favor.
Well, not everything is pro free market, there are many thkngs that cant be boycotted and more commonly things that take a lot of brain power to boycott. 
That description is one of the best arguments for government oversite ive seen in a while. Allowing companies to "do it themselves" by attacking anyone who disagrees with them is really, really dangerous. 
> Everything is pro-freemarket until you ask government regulators to step in.

Like asking the federal government to step into to fix the manufacturing sector?
Absolutely nothing. Just a bunch of salty liberals trying to bash right wingers with some stupid logic.
> What does a boycott have to do with being anti-free market?

It could be argued that if they really were pro-free market, they would not get all angry about a company pulling their advertising. 
> Consumers have complete free will in either respect

Yeah, you'd think that.  But realistically speaking, media can have a huge influence over people's minds.  That's exactly what both sides have been saying about the other team and media coverage of them all election season.  It even landed us into the whole "fake news - to censor or not to censor" debaclebate.

Kellogg's silently pulling ads from Breitbart - for whatever reason - would make almost no impact on readers of that site other than possibly not being swayed to eat Kellogg's cereals as often as their eyeballs are less exposed.  
Breitbart actively saying "this company pulled their ads - THEY ARE UNAMERICAN - BOYCOTT THEM!" has a much larger impact on their viewers.  Those who would never have noticed, now are made very much aware.  Those who aren't sure how to feel about this, are being told by a site they're likely to align with exactly how to feel about this.  'Free will' notwithstanding a lot of people are going to happily go along with it.

This isn't new.  The same sort of thing happened to The Dixie Chicks (singer makes stupid remark, some people upset, singer claims freedom of speech, people in places of influence claim freedom of speech != freedom from consequences of that speech, and gently nudge entire networks of conservative radio stations to spread the word about the need to boycott them, burn their albums, etc.)  If anybody honestly believes that 'free will' made the masses run along with that narrative, they need a reality check.
> The free market inherently means making choices over competing products

Unless of course there is a monopoly established, which is what lack of regulation often ultimately leads to, one big conglomerate putting his thumb on the consumer and abusing the power because the consumer has no alternative. You will soon see massive abuse of the internet monopolies when the free marketers kill net neutrality.

How is that false equivalency?
cnn, msnbc
you listed liberal rags
kelloggs is a consumer products company that makes consumable goods.  Breitbart is an independent, opinion news source.  
How are they not consistent?
I mean, not really.  They have the right to do whatever they want to do for whatever reason provided there's no government, monopoly, or authority influence.  That's the literal free market.  You don't have to agree/understand with someone's business decision just because they can do it. 
This attitude is epitomized by an elderly voter stating "I don't want the Government in my life, and stay the hell away from my Medicare"....
Well said.

> No one wants a real free market.

Many think they know what a free market is. Unchecked capitalism is what we should fear. Not innocent market driven kind.

The types of ideologies I disagree with are those that scream free market and confusing lobbied market powers doing whatever it wishes and unchecked. From environmental to avoiding taxation while raking in massive profits. At the same time utilizing the resources in the country yet giving nothing back while moving jobs overseas. 

Like you said. *No one wants a real free market.*
> Selling ads is anti free market.

Not when the market is...um, *marketing*.  Ads are publicity for products, but they're also products themselves.
Im not a trump supporter. Im not sure what the context of this is. If hes calling for deregulation then its still pro freemarket. Asking to put tariffs on incoming goods. Not free market. 
We're only salty because we get to keep eating sodium filled kellogs food,  the red guys don't :)
Well they probably wouldn't have started a boycott if Kellog's decision had been a market one, rather than a PR or political one. There wouldn't be a boycott if the reason for pulling ads was based on charging too much, not reaching the desired target demographic, insufficient clicks/pageviews ect. 
The opposite side of that, however, is companies policing what their business partners say, think, and do. Huff Po/Salon/etc are pretty hateful/wretched occasionally, but you don't see the same ad removal.
True. Some people are stupid and take what's told to them at face value.

What's interesting though was that we had 95% of MSM bashing Trump this election, as well as a 10:1 ratio of ad dollars spent on anti-trump ads, mass celebrity endorsements for Hillary, and yet Trump still won in a land-slide. 

You mean Crooked Hillary? 
Because Drumpf was Trump's family name up until the 1800's, not like he changed it a few years before coming famous.

Did you point out something verified and legitimate, like her conflicts of interest, her coziness to Wall Street, or her entrenchment in the typical, deal-making parts of politics?  Or did you call her "Killary" and say she's a criminal who should be in jail?  Or claim she attacked women that her husband raped?  Seriously asking, since there are real criticisms of her, and she was DEEPLY FLAWED, but I rarely heard legit references to her failings and missteps outside of the mainstream media.  It was mostly mud-slinging, hate-filled conspiracy theories.

I believe one was the other's brother.
John Harvey Kellogg ran a sanitarium in Michigan where he and his brother Will Keith Kellogg developed the forerunner to Corn Flakes.  John Harvey, who promoted vegetarianism, added Corn Flakes to the menu at the sanitarium.  Will Keith, who was a businessman, saw an opportunity to sell Corn Flakes to the general public so started the Kellogg Company to manufacture the cereal.  In order to make the cereal more palatable to the general population, the recipe was changed by Will Keith adding more sweeteners to it which caused a rift between the two brothers. 
My agency just did that a few weeks ago when our parent company came up.
Sorry, you'll have to try again, I asked for news organizations that are as biased as Brietbart. Unless they've also called for boycotts on companies for not advertising with them. 
All of the agencies I listed are considered extremely reliable, center-left or center-right sources. I'd urge you to consider whether you got that opinion from an honest evaluation of the facts, or whether you got it from either 1) a conservative politician who wanted to discredit respected media sources, or 2) a conservative news outlet that wanted to discredit respected sources.
what's your point? people have always voted with their wallets. that's the free market.

also, when your chief of staff nom is the CEO of a mainstream media outlet, you're no longer independent.
To be clear, I'm trying to clarify the argument about why Breitbart may be considered hypocritical here. If they were truly all about the free market, then they would accept that some advertises need to pull out out of necessity- it may hurt their brand to be associated with the organisation. 

I really don't know enough about Breitbart to say for certain whether they are contradicting themselves here.
So fucking this.
I couldn't facepalm hard enough when I saw people holding up signs like that prior to the ACA being put into law
It is a market one. Big companies have no other metric for making decisions. They don't want to associate their brand with what Breitbart publishes. 
Now that a precedent has been set, this may no longer be the case.

It probably won't happen immediately, however.

Oh. I'm sorry. If you happened to dislike not having a choice about circumcision, you probably have a lot of company in your generation. A [2012 online survey of Australian doctors](http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/strong-opposition-to-newborn-circumcision) found 74% believed newborn circumcision should not be offered to parents (i.e., considered routine) and 51% considered it tantamount to child abuse. That's especially amusing considering the single most active and vociferous circumcision activist on earth is [Brian Morris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7a7RLMc4Cg), who is Australian. As we always have with circumcision activists, Americans take him more seriously than his countrymen do. We like people who tell us what we want to hear.
>caused a riff between the two brothers

*guitar wailing hard in the background*
Yeah when your parent company came up because duh, but do you do it with every single conflict of interest?
Kellogg's believes that advertising on Breitbart will hurt their brand and therefore sales. Breitbart has a very large following, and has simply made it known that Kellogg's is not interested in retaining/earning the business of its readership due to their views. I don't see how this is hypocritical or somehow against the 'free market' in any way. 

I think its kind of petty and may actually scare away potential advertisers from Breitbart, but a poor business decision does not equal 'anti-freemarket'. Breitbart is simply encouraging their readership to use the free market to vote with their wallets. 
Right and Breitbart wants their readership to know that the Kellog's brand does not support their point of view and encouraged them to vote with their wallets to choose a cereal brand that does (or at least doesn't explicitly state that they don't). 
RS didn't do anything like that.

Hell, the reporter in question failed the very basics of reporting and wasn't fired for utterly failing her job in every possible way.
I mean, I'm sure we've occasionally slipped up, but suffice to say I haven't seen an instance of it. And regardless, I'm not in the marketing section so I rarely know what we're advertising anyways (which makes it difficult to have a conflict of interest over it).

But when a Christian baker doesn't even want to make a business agreement with a gay couple for a wedding, that baker should be ran out of business.  Do I have this correct?

Does no one else have a problem with this?  All these people pulling out of North Carolina are doing just that - pulling out.  They already had agreements and deals set up with these PRIVATE BUSINESSES.  And now they are breaking those agreements and deals because they disagree with a bill that would ultimately effect less than 0.3% of the population.

>when a Christian baker doesn't even want to make a business agreement 

because they hate people

And that's the difference conservatives are trying to weasel their way around. They're not the same at all. They're totally opposite. You're like that cliche villian who comes up to the hero and tells them how they are exactly alike you and I. Then that villian gets punched in the face and taken to jail.
People would definitely not agree with this behavior if the businesses were pushing for something...like relaxing environmental regulations.  And these businesses definitely still operate all over the world.
>  Christian baker doesn't even want to make a business agreement with a gay couple for a wedding, that baker should be ran out of business. Do I have this correct?

No, you don't have it right. Not all "agreements" are equal. 

The *public market place,* aka stores and businesses that serves the public, isn't the same as making a hotel reservation, and you simply cancel your reservation. 

What you're not seeing in this "agreement" dynamic, is the *consumer* is the one that's opting out of doing business. In the public market place, the consumer gets to pick the service they're willing to pay for, not the provider of the service picking whom they shall serve. 

Public taxes pay for the infrastructure to allow the baker to run his/her business (roads, water, electricity, fire department, police protection, etc). 28 states, or so, have no protections for people in the LGBT community. This will change over time. Not necessarily because of the good will of lawmakers, but because money has always been the engine of social change. 

I suggest you google "public accommodations" and "protected classes." 

>All these people pulling out of North Carolina are doing just that - pulling out. They already had agreements and deals set up with these PRIVATE BUSINESSES. And now they are breaking those agreements and deals because they disagree with a bill that would ultimately effect less than 0.3% of the population.

And you're not going to see a single lawsuit arise out of it, unless there was a contract that was breached. 

You don't understand the concept of, "the customer picks the business; the business doesn't get to choose their class of customers," "religious beliefs" or not. For the most part right now, and in those states that fear bathrooms so much, when their economy dies, they'll be singing a different tune. Unfortunately, some good people will be hurt economically by this, but such is the price of stupid lawmakers. 
Intolerance of intolerance is not the same thing as intolerance.

Move on to your next tired talking point.
It's weird that all these internet people who claim they totally don't have anything against LGBT rights are so upset by this boycott.
Probably because a boycott like this is way more effective in the us then some third world country 
It's almost like there are other states with less odious politics that business can be easily shifted to, but it's a bit more challenging to find another China. 

Besides, it's not like they're refusing to sell corn flakes. They're just opting to hold their convention elsewhere. If NC doesn't like that, well, too bad
Careful your ignorance is showing.
You mueslix see this kind of systemic discrimination in third world countries. 
I never fully got the attraction to Tony... I am just fine with Chip the Cookie Crisp Wolf. He could crisp my cookie any day!!!
Quite possibly.
Asheville used to be one of the most gay friendly cities in the nation. It still is, but it used to be too.
Unfortunately, all the places that are getting punished are the ones that are very open and forward thinking about this type of thing. Asheville, Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, and yea, definitely Chapel Hill. I'd imagine Boone is losing tourism dollars too. It's a really sad state of affairs. 
Amendment one was admitted by some of its sponsors to only be around for ten or so years. It was two years before it was ruled over by the courts. Hopefully we will see a similar thing. Or the morons get voted out.
Corn flakes were originally invented because John Kellogg thought that they would [prevent masturbation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention)

>Yes we should applaud 

Only because you subjectively agree with it. Your whole viewpoint is the law should be selectively enforced based on viewpoint. 
>with a State that created and enforces a bigoted, discriminatory, and pointless law.

How is the law discriminatory?  
>anti hate

You can't just say "anti hate" and have that be your argument.  I'm so tired of these "bigot", "racist", "misogynist" responses that take zero thought to put together.

These Christian bakers, for example, make goods for gay people all the time.  How is that hate? 
Many of these business - I'm looking at you PayPal - operate in Middle Eastern countries that literally kill people for being gay. 
>the consumer gets to pick the service they're willing to pay for, not the provider of the service picking whom they shall serve.

No, it's not one-sided.  It's a two-way street.  Just because a customer demands a service doesn't mean someone else should be forced to provide it.  

>Public taxes pay for the infrastructure to allow the baker to run his/her business

True.  And the baker contributes to all those taxes.  Nothing additional is needed.  

Again, if this were a baker refusing to make a cake with a hardcore sex scene, nobody would bat at an eye or claim any discrimination against straight couples.  It's all bullshit. 

Hell, if it was a Muslim baker refusing to make a gay cake, nobody would say anything, either.  It's literally ONLY because the baker is Christian.
Don't bother with the troll. He's one of these guys who hates China and blah blah blah but if the same T-shirt he was buying for $4 was made in america for $14 he'd still buy the $4 one.
I wasn't talking about third world countries. Theres plenty of rich countries with terrible laws but nobody really cares what happens there, so there's no boycott.
That was kind of my point. Money rules over morals. This N.C. boycott is just basicly marketing because they don't lose too much in it.
Really? Is it such a stretch?

It's still being debated whether the condition is a mental illness or not.  It's all relative.  Either one of you could be looked at as ignorant depending on the perspective.
Booberry is one sexy ghost.
[deleted]
Right.  He said it would prevent masturbation.  He really just wanted to sell animal feed to humans which he succeeded in.
He also never consummated with his wife and loved him some enemas. He was a weird guy. 
Because it takes two hands to eat cereal?
I don't believe I did, but if you support a law that singles out a small group of people for no real reason then if the shoe fits, lace them bitches up. 

As I stated in the post you are responding too, there is no point to this law. My "non-bigoted" ideas don't single out a group of people based on how they view themselves. This law does nothing but demean people who don't identify with their genitalia. Hence, bigoted. As for believing the same in reverse, while this is true the same people who believed black people shouldn't use the same restrooms as white are the same ideas that enacted this law. 

>This in a nutshell is why politics and society are so galvanized that no one can get anything done.

No, the reason why nothing gets done is because people waste time on meaningless laws that serve no purpose and then are shocked, SHOCKED, when it they are called out on it. So instead of applying the time and resources to important problems, they make laws to solve problems that don't exist.   


Human rights shouldn't be subject to opinion.
All opinions are subjective so I don't know what you are implying, other then the obvious. As for my viewpoint, my whole viewpoint is this law is a waste of time, money, and resources to solve a nonexistent problem.   
It discriminates against woman who identify as man and vice versa. Men who look like women, women who look like men. 
Hell, a few of them will even serve black people too! The fact that they discriminate at all is what's wrong. The fact that they will turn away a customer for anything other than just being a bad customer is what is wrong. What if they then decided not to sell to Jews, then Muslims. If you are going to do business within a society you should be smarter than to turn away business for anything that isn't an immediate problem. If a gay guy walks in and is acting like a total ass, feel free to turn him away. But to turn him away simply for being gay is what's shitty. 
You're an idiot. 
see the reason you're tired of these common zero thought responses labelled as 'anti-hate' is because most sane people put zero thought into going out of their way to discriminate against people who really are doing nothing at all to harm them.
So we shouldn't try to resolve this issue at home because other countries do bad things?
Well, you're wrong on all counts, but I have to concede that people in the LGBT community, doesn't have universal protections. Yet.

The baker doesn't pay for *all* the taxes, where, ALL tax paying citizens do. 

Also, the 14th amendment states in part:  "In addition, it forbids states from denying any person "life, liberty or property, without due process of law" or to "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” By directly mentioning the role of the states, the 14th Amendment greatly expanded the protection of civil rights to all Americans and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment."

The Oregon bakers got their due process, and they're paying the penalty. 

Why are you dragging Muslims into this? It's only Christian asshats that do this stupid shit. 

Calling something bullshit, doesn't create a fact. And, your hypothetical scenarios is shifting the goal posts. Did the gay couple who was denied service ask for any hard core sex? They were denied service for simply being gay. Big diff. Chalk up on the law, logic, the Constitution. 

You're sure invested in all this gay stuff, huh? 
I always have high hopes going to American apparel but I just can't stand their clothing and end up going elsewhere.
To be honest, we can't be bothered to complain about every social and economic grievance that exists in the world. There's always something worse of course.  We have to prioritize our political dialogue and this issue hits closer to home for most of us so that's why it's generating such a response. 
Agreed it's mostly a PR stunt, but it's still slowly pinching NC and keeping the issue in the news.
My dear. The world, people, corporations work on the formula **'Gains-(Losses+Effort)'** if it's more effort and you lose more then you gain the vast majority of people won't do something.

Also you need to factor in real world things, like money, to your  "lets not support hateful countries" bit.  
Where are people, who are already moaning about fuel prices, going to buy fuel, at current prices gotten from the Middle east Or fuel at 2,3+x more from some more 'Moral' country?

That's life.
morals? If large corporations don't produce in China, they go out of business and their competition takes over their market share.  Also, intentionally running your business into the ground like that is unfair to your shareholders and actually illegal.
I don't think there is any debate, its pretty clear to me that a lot of bigots are mentally ill.
Remember homosexuality was considered a
Mental illness to at one point
Well, if you think about it, masturbation is kinda gay. 
> He also never consummated with his wife 

That poor, poor, poor woman :( 
And when did we agree that it is a human right to use the bathroom not of your sex?
>It discriminates against woman who identify as man and vice versa.

That's my point.  If you don't believe this idea of "gender" is fluid, this law does the exact opposite.  It says that you are who you are and there is nothing you can do to change that.  It treats you as you *actually* are versus who you *think* you are.  That's not discrimination.

And remember, only around 0.3% of the population even identifies as transgender.  All this hubub and shattering of previously agreed upon business agreements is for less 0.3% population.  I say less than because a small portion of transgendered can pass and nobody would bat an eye regardless if they used the wrong restroom.
>The fact that they discriminate at all is what's wrong. 

They don't discriminate against gays, though.  They are refusing to do business for one, specific event.  For you to actually have a correct argument that the baker discriminates against gays, the baker would have to discriminate against ALL gays everytime one wanted to get any baked good.


Compelling argument
Wait.  What?  We have two sides to this:

1.  The Christian baker who simply says "no" to a gay couple looking for a baker to make a wedding cake.  And keep in mind that the baker isn't outright refusing service to all gay people.  They simple don't want to make a specific type of wedding cake.

2.  The gay couple who, after being refused by one baker, decides to open a lawsuit in order to sue the Christian baker for monetary compensation due to "emotional" damages.

Tell me again.  Who is going out of their way to harm the other party?


There is no issue at home.  These companies boycotting the state are negatively impacting hundreds of thousands of people for 0.3% of the population.  

I take that back.  There IS an issue.  The issue is that we're making accommodations for 0.3% of the population whose brains are wired incorrectly.  
You're completely ignoring rational thought.  Would there be any problem with a Christian baker refusing to make a cake celebrating a straight relationship by decorating with a hardcore sex scene?
That's the problem right there. Why care about huge issues, when there's a problem of who gets to use what bathroom right here.
>keeping the issue in the news.

The wrong part of the issue. Too many people think this bullshit with the bathroom is the real problem, but the law actually has a lot *worse* shit in it that is being smokescreened because all these dumbasses are so eager for that sweet schadenfreude. 

The real bad shit limits worker protections in the state and prevents cities from setting their own minimum wage, which is technically *good* for business. Kind of ironic, really, that the fixed statewide minimum wage problem is ignored in favor of the bathroom bullshit that will be repealed. Part of the law that is silly and unenforceable gets repealed and the rest of the real nasty shit stays put while the masses seek their superiority elsewhere, believing it to be established here. 

What a fucking joke the discourse about this law is.
True but I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy.
Nice condescending tone you start with. I know all all that, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy.
Money rules over morals. I just think it's hypocrisy to take a moral stance and not follow it through.
So, say, a professional psychologist who after years of study on the topic comes to the conclusion that it is indeed a mental disorder would be a mentally ill bigot?  

To be clear, I don't fall on one side or the other because the fact is that I do not know the answer and no one does.  But it's tiring seeing the flames thrown back and forth over a topic no one truly understands at this point in time.  (BTW, the definition of bigot is a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.  Seems to me like both sides fall under that umbrella.)
And it's not anymore after years of research and debate.
Especially if you have to masturbate in the bathroom full of other dudes.
It was probably when most of us went to learn about empathy and compassion for mankind, it seems a few of you guys missed that. Just in case you wanted to be caught up, the majority of civilized people believe that not only denying the opportunity for people that have a body/gender disassociation to be able to use public restrooms is bad, but also making a state law that makes it illegal for any city in the state from doing anything to protect LBGT people  is really shitty as well.
I won't disagree with you there. Transgender and transsexual people still confuse me. But in the perfectly developed, Western countries I grew up in both sexes would be seen using the same restroom.  

That's not a human rights issue. You're inventing an argument. 

So a better question is, why are you ashamed of your genetils?

I live in the USA. as a citizen of a self proclaimed democracy, I will continue to advocate equality.  

So yeah. We should all use the same bathrooms. Water fountains.  Bus seats. Voting rights. 
>If you don't believe this idea of "gender" is fluid

You don't have to "believe" facts. They're still facts.
> It treats you as you actually are versus who you think you are. That's not discrimination.

I don't think we want to get into a philosophical debate on what you *actually* are versus who you *think* you are. I think therefor I am. There is no purpose to telling someone what bathroom they need use. 

>And remember, only around 0.3% of the population even identifies as transgender. All this hubub and shattering of previously agreed upon business agreements is for less 0.3% population. I say less than because a small portion of transgendered can pass and nobody would bat an eye regardless if they used the wrong restroom.

If only 0.3% of the population identifies as transgender, what was the point of creating this law? What was the point of going through this song and dance if only a very very small percentage of the population would be effected by it? If it was to single out that small group of people because they are process what their bodies are differently and vilify them, then this law is on it's way to success. 
The baker. The gay couple are going out of their way to be treated like any other people. The baker is the one refusing to play nice.
That 'Christian Baker' you keep referring to. Do you have a link to an article where they refused to make a certain type of cake? Are these good innocent people who are being mistreated by the evil gays real or just something you made up?
HB2 is about a lot more than bathrooms, which I suspect you know. If you want to feign ignorance, that's fine. But even .3% of the population deserves to be accommodated if it harms no one.
And you're constantly shifting the goal posts, from not responding to anything that was put forth to you. You ask a lot of questions, but answer none. 

Why don't you stick to things that's actually happened, and leave hypotheticals out of it, in an attempt to create a foundation to justify bigotry?  
Please familiarize yourself with HB2 before you spout these things. The bathroom thing is only one piece of this garbage legislation.
You're spot on with that. Money over morality every time. That's why pot legalization is such a huge headfuck for some of today's society. On one hand you have ignorance, fear and hatred towards weed because of generations of propaganda. On the other hand you have hefty tax revenue... "OMG would you look at all that money they have from taxes off that devil weed."

Greed will win.
Except it's not hypocrisy, hypocrisy would be to remove a conference from a state for certain legislation but keep one in another state with similar legislation because it only benefited you to remove from the first.
>the majority of civilized people believe that not only denying the opportunity for people that have a body/gender disassociation to be able to use public restrooms is bad

["Most Americans \(59 percent\) aren't comfortable with the idea of transgender students picking which bathroom or locker room to use, and think they should use the facilities of the gender they were born as, while 26 percent think they should be allowed to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their preferred gender."](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-transgender-kids-and-school-bathrooms/)
What exactly are facts, in your opinion?  Women have wombs and are able to give birth to babies.  Men impregnate women with their sperm.  Those are some pretty clear lines.  

Would you consider race to be fluid, too?  Can I be Asian even though I was born white?  


>There is no purpose to telling someone what bathroom they need use.

True, but surely you'd agree that on private property, the owner has the right to determine who uses which bathrooms, right?

>If only 0.3% of the population identifies as transgender, what was the point of creating this law?

Why are you asking me this?  I didn't write the law.  I didn't vote on it.  I'm only debating the central aspect of the law.  I would *guess* that the point of passing it would be ensure that it's never even an issue down the line.


Are you shitting me.  The baker said "no".  The gay couple is suing and will get a six figure settlement due to "emotional" damages. When it comes to actual harm, it's pretty one-sided, don't you think?  

The gay couple can just move on and find a different baker.  The baker, on the other hand, is now out of business.
[Source](http://www.ijreview.com/2015/04/306447-2-tough-weekend-controversial-christian-bakery-receives-135000-fine-gofundme-account-canceled/)

These bakers aren't refusing service to ALL gay people.  They simply refused to make a cake for a gay wedding.  Again, the actual, tangible harm being done here is incredibly one-sided.  One couple gets to find a different baker AND legally get a six-figure "reward".  The other couple - the Christian bakers - are out of business.  
>HB2 is about a lot more than bathrooms, which I suspect you know. If you want to feign ignorance

What else is it about then?  I'm always told it's about bathrooms.  I'm always told by these boycotting companies that it's about bathrooms.  What else is it about?
Yes ! Thank you. 
Please don't make assumptions when you spout these things. I never said it was only about the bathroom thing.
I wasn't talking about this one incident but the whole phenomena of boycotting N.C.
Note somethingelse4's use of the phrase "civilized people." In other words, compassionate, empathetic, sensible people who have better things to do with their time than bully people who aren't hurting anyone.
2 years old, brah. Opinions change quicly.
I did not know that the majority of Americans had this opinion, its a little disheartening, however when we look back in history we also see that at some point in time the majority of Americans believed that:

African Americans should count for less than one whole human

Women were not intelligent enough to handle voting

Irish immigrants were not good for anything other than getting drunk and working as servants

States should be allowed to make laws that kept African Americans from using the same facilities as Whites, also banning any interracial marriage


So I hope that as previous bigoted ideas, this hatred of the transgender community will be just another black mark of American history in the near future.
Ugh.

Biological Sex and Gender are not the same thing, and the APA agrees. Gender is a social construct, while race is not.

Your talking points are tired. Put them to bed.
>True, but surely you'd agree that on private property, the owner has the right to determine who uses which bathrooms, right?

You have every right on private property to do whatever you want. It's your property, you can tell anyone who wants to use your bathroom they need to stand on their head and spin three times and then try to pee. But this law isn't about private property, it's about a State government telling it's people what bathroom you must use just because... why again?

>Why are you asking me this? I didn't write the law. I didn't vote on it. I'm only debating the central aspect of the law. I would guess that the point of passing it would be ensure that it's never even an issue down the line.

I'm asking because you are debating a law that has no purpose. The central aspect of this law solves zero problems and there is no evidence to support that this law will ever be needed. 
Your scenario is entirely hypothetical at this point and based off absolutely no real-world examples.

The only homosexual folks who have been awarded compensation received a payout because the bakers in question spread their personal information.

If you have any other examples of "six figure settlement[s] due to emotional damages," I'd sure love to see them.

>The gay couple can just move on and find a different baker.

They should not have to. They are not second-class citizens.
So what you said about them refusing to make a specific type of cake was untrue. They refused to make a cake specifically for gay people having a wedding. They might have even refused others because but they didn't think to check their gay licenses for regular birthday cakes and cakes shaped like huge penises.

Thanks for making my point about them being bigots.
You didn't even read the law you're so fervently opposed to?

That's straight up dictionary-definition ignorance.
Right to employment, meaning you can use this law to fire a person for being gay. Gay people can be refused service at banks, clinics, or hospitals. Since political parties are private institutions, they can prevent gay people from running for office. Are these serous enough? Hard to argue gay people are normal people if they don't have any representatives in government fighting for basic human rights.  
> when there's a problem of who gets to use what bathroom right here.

I see...
North Carolina are the only state to have passed a law specify banning any Pro-LGBT laws from passing, In a Demoncrasy like America these things shouldn't exist compared to the more dictatorship like countries like the middle east and Russia etc.

I don't see your problem here whether its for PR or not, N.C have crossed a line and Companies and Musicians are standing against grossly discrimination laws. 
Then find a more recent poll. 
I'm saying that race is far, far, FAR more fluid than this idea of "gender".  Do you not agree?
>it's about a State government telling it's people what bathroom you must use just because..?

I think the law only covers schools and other public facilities and NOT private property.  Feel free to correct me, though.

>I'm asking because you are debating a law that has no purpose. The central aspect of this law solves zero problems and there is no evidence to support that this law will ever be needed

Laws are used for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes you wait until *after* a problem happens.  Sometimes you address the problem *before* it gets larger.  And sometimes you pass a law simply to clarify an issue that is seemingly being brought up.

Do you recognize that not all laws are required to solve an urgent, pressing matter?  
[Fuck off](http://www.ijreview.com/2015/04/306447-2-tough-weekend-controversial-christian-bakery-receives-135000-fine-gofundme-account-canceled/) with that nonsense.  These bakers were forced out of business and made to pay $135,000 because the gay couple couldn't be bothered to find another baker.  And the fine 100% DID NOT have anything to do with spreading personal information about the gay couple.  Get your facts straight.


>So what you said about them refusing to make a specific type of cake was untrue. 

How so?  The specific type of cake is a wedding cake.  What I said was 100% true.  And now they are out of business because they didn't want to make a specific type of cake.  And the gay couple are "entitled" to a six-figure reward because their feelings were hurt and they couldn't be bothered to go to a different bakery.  

Again, who is actually going out of their way to harm the other party again?  



Do I need to considering the primary issue is well-known?  Do I really need to know what passage of the law amends what passage of a different law?  

Is the primary issue bathroom use or not?
>Right to employment, meaning you can use this law to fire a person for being gay.

You've clearly read the law so could cite the passage in the law that states it would be legal to fire someone *exclusively* for being gay?
So that's your proof that I only know one thing about HB2? Good luck with your debating career dum dum.
I don't see problem standing against it either. It's just funny how the moral stance doesn't stop them from making money in worse places.
No. Of course I don't agree. In what way would race be more fluid?
>the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries brought charges against them for violating Oregon’s Equality Act of 2007. They were found guilty in January, 2015, with a financial penalty potential of up to $150,000, to be determined at a later date.

So did you just conveniently skip over the part where they *broke the fucking law?*
> These bakers were forced out of business and made to pay $135,000 because the gay couple couldn't be bothered to find another baker.

Tough shit. What if there's only ONE baker in town, or ONE gas station, etc? Every citizen has a reasonable expectation to be serviced at a store, if they're willing to pay the price for the service. 

Oregon has laws that gives protection against discrimination. What part of that do you not understand? The parties that were harmed were the gay couple that wasn't served. Because that doesn't comport with your bigoted beliefs, tough. Your defense amounts to, "I don't agree with it." That's not how the law works. Now, if this couple were in another state, like MS, or NC, they wouldn't have had those protections. So enjoy watching people getting fucked over while you can. This bigoted asswipes will have to fall in line with modern society, or starve themselve by going out of business. Fuck 'em. 
Did you even read your article? No, it wasn't a specific type of cake. That would be them saying I want a red cake and the cake maker saying we only serve blue cakes. 

They refused to make a cake for a specific type of people. We make red cakes, we make blue cakes, but we don't make cakes for you.

Religious beliefs be damned too, those people honestly don't deserve to call themselves christian. I spent 15 years growing up as a devout go to church Sunday every week christian and was taught to accept people for who they are. Maybe those fucking fascist cakemakers need to go back and look at the book they claim they follow. 

Maybe if they didn't try to hide behind religion and just admitted they were being silly bigots and apologized yeah then I'd agree they probably don't deserve all the backlash, but it seems they didn't learn from their mistake and decided to dig their family deeper and deeper into the hole. Funny how they complain about their life being hell after they dug themselves down in it so deep.
No, it's not the primary issue. Businesses don't care about restrooms, they care about employees, and primarily being sued by employees when the business tries to deny them the basic worker's rights that this law allows companies to do.
3.1 is the section concerning protected classes of citizens, or the people who you can't fire solely on race, age, sex, religion, etc. LGBT or "gays" aren't listed on the protected classes and further provisions of the law forbid local, county, or city governments from passing laws to give them equal rights that the state laws don't. 

I could cite the passages, but I'm not a lawyer and neither are you. I wouldn't want to put either of us to sleep.
So why are YOU the one focusing on the bathroom piece with your exact words? 

>dum dum

You're right. Debate over. You have bested me with your wit.
Because they can't make money in better places. 

In the same way that there will always be psychopaths and murders, there will always be cold business wo/men who want to make loads of money, so buy stuff cheap from worse places ,china etc, and loads of people will choose them to save money not caring about it being made in the worse place, so other companies either have to match or try to be niche which is not always possible.

The world isn't full of Gandis and dalai lamas, it's full of selfish animals called humans who want the lowest price possible and business' deliver it

The vast, vast majority helps when they can as long as it doesn't inconvenience them too much. That's what Kellogg did, that's what I do, that's what you do. No Hypocrisy, No funny moral stance. That's life.
Weird to see a hostile Kellogg story right after briebart declared war on them
Every company that has used a 3rd world nation for cheap labor has used child labor. It really is unavoidable. What people do not understand is that labor portions of agriculture, factory, or warehousing work abroad are NOT owned and managed by our big American companies. They are owned by local companies that specialize in finding the cheap labor in the area and managing them who then pimp them out to whoever will pay them for work. I own a construction company, and I have without a doubt hired an illegal immigrant. I dont want to, I do everything I am required to prevent such a thing, but it still happens. The drywaller I hired to do the drywalling will have someone with forged papers who is working on my job and getting paid under the table. If I all of a sudden become a target of the media or ran for office, a BS article could be written about me saying, "constructor of things uses illegal immigrants even though he is against it, what a douche!" But it is unavoidable. Kelloggs and Nestle would like to not use child labor, and there are things in practice there that prevent child labor usage, not because they give a fuck about the morals, they dont want to be a target of the media. They require the labor providing subcontractors to prove the age of their works, but in a 3rd world country, there isnt exactly pristine methods of proof available. It is all easily forgeable. 
But Kellogg's won't advertise on Breitbart so they're the good guys
How many Chinese laborers committed suicide while making my iPhone?
They'd better.  I'm paying top dollar here!
Nothing to see here go back to you Little Debbie fat cakes.
In the places where this stuff comes from, it seems almost inhumane to *not* hire children, if they/their family is able to earn anything. That's what people do there. They work. That's their livelihood.

We still have child labor right here in America. Picking tobacco of all things. 
Palm Oil - yummy another PUFA to which there's tons of mounting evidence it's contributing to all kinds of disease!

That's the real crime!

Note:   I'm not talking about natural virgin palm oil - but the stuff that's so refined you may as well eat Castrol Syntech; IE the crap these multinational penny pinching profit mongers that don't give two craps about your health use!
Is there anything disgusting nestle isn't involved in?
Is this the first shot in Breitbart's war against Kellogg's?
Is it free range child labor?  I prefer free range steroid lite soy only child labor in the products I use.
Great, now I have to choose between being a neo-nazi and supporting child labor.
Child labor in countries where schooling is rare and families struggle to get by isn't a bad thing. Obviously we want to improve their situation, but banning child labor just gets those kids fired, puts them on the street, and  hurts their families.

You need to improve the country's economy and education to get rid of child labor, not shame US companies into moving their production/supply elsewhere or have the kids fired from their jobs.
Companies should disavow Kellogg's as their sponsor
Not surprised at all that this surfaced only now, after trumpets declared war on Kelloggs. Fragile snowflakes get so easily triggered, I'm just sitting here eating my third bowl of raisin bran
What can find a substitute for this right? Because rain forests are being wiped out because of it. 
> Breitbart declares war on Kellogg's after cereal brand pulls advertising from site: The right-wing news organization is calling for a boycott on Kellogg’s products after company says Breitbart is not ‘aligned with our values’

Well now I don't know whom to believe!

What r/news looks like right now.
Kelloggs' employees also piss in the cereal. 
They hire 3rd parties to find cheap labor.  So the firms can blame them instead of taking the blame themselves 
And to all you fellas out there, Unilever acquired dollar shave club a couple months ago on the low. Time to turn that Mo'vember into a Decembeard.
This just in water is wet
Unless they're slaves or force to work I don't see any problems with this. If they're not making palm oil then they would be doing something else to feed themselves or their family.
The people that get pissed about this all make there kids do chores. They in essence are using child labor.

Edit: not saying chores are bad, in fact they are good for teaching a work ethic
When corporations are people they end up being bad people.
Yeah, weird that Kellogg suddenly pulls a PR stunt by blocking Brietbart when they know **Amnesty International**, an NGO on human rights, is about to expose  Kellogg for being scumbags. 

Maybe it's some vast right-wing conspiracy to undermine the good folks at Kellogg! /s
If these large multinational corporations actually wanted to pay their laborers fairly and source their labor ethically, they would figure out a way to do it. They just don't care.
Exactly.

People get outraged about this, but fail to look at their own hands.

If you own an electronic device, you personally **YES YOU** likely support evil dictatorial regimes that use profits from the mining of Coltan to fund their oppressive regimes and campaigns of ethnic cleansing.

"I didn't know" **isn't an excuse**. There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of reports on this.

"I can't check the supplier of my products" **isn't an excuse**. The ability to check if a manufacturer has taken steps to only use conflict-free components is a finger-tap or mouse-click away.

The use of revenue from mining operations by terrible regimes is common, public, knowledge to all but those who live in willful ignorance.

Every single human being on planet earth with an electronic device capable of connecting to the Internet knows this, or at least they should unless they are so uninformed that their opinion should be dismissed as irrelevant due to ignorance of the world around them.

Unless you are a piece-of-shit hypocrite the only solution is to immediately dispose of all of your ill-gotten gains, and only purchase products from suppliers who can guarantee that the tantalum capacitors and other electronic components used in their devices are made from materials that are not sourced from areas where oppressive regimes control ore extraction.

[The list of manufacturers who certify that their products are "blood ore" free is very short.](http://www.enoughproject.org/files/publications/corporate_action_fact_sheet-1.pdf)

Are people who own an electronic device made by a company not on the list of manufacturers who have an auditing system in place more, equally, or less guilty than Kellogg's?

Your cellphone may have but the cheap-ass no-name charger or battery pack you bought probably has a capacitor in it that funded a child soldier. *"Oh but I only killed like 1/1000th of a person..."*
I understand your context but how many times have you accidentally hired an 8 year old to do drywalling or concrete mixing because he just so happened to have a good fake ID? I mean, being 4'2" and unable to grow facial hair is pretty normal for construction, right?
Remember to choose the corporate overlord that's nicest to your own people!
Kellogg pulled their advertising since they support Black Lives Matter, donating $900,000 to a group Breitbart considers a domestic terrorist group.  
There's an app for that

Just so you know, Foxconn isn't just Apple, they make products for Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, Nokia, Amazon, Acer, Google, Dell, Cisco, Intel, HP, etc.
"The places where this stuff comes from" are that way because of western imperialism and capitalism.
>In the places where this stuff comes from, it seems almost inhumane to not hire children,

Dude, I totally get you, here is a [relaxing video](https://youtu.be/mb19scAqzcw?t=25) that explains the real truth about child labour laws to everyone and tells how they can help!
I'm pretty sure that the people who run Nestle are the closest thing reality has to actual supervillains. 
No, Kellogg used Brietbart as a preemptive strike to distract from the fact they use child labor. If you read the article, you'd know Amnesty International broke the story and I can guarantee they don't like Brietbart. 
You can bet your ass! Expect more to come
Pretty sure they're factory farmed.  You ever try and catch free-range children?  It's like herding cats.

If companies disavow every group that has child labor in third world countries, companies will soon find it harder to find a sponsor than it is to find Nessy
*What?*

Breitbart made Kelloggs support child labor because their advertising was pulled?
I think it's worse that they're/we're driving demand and refuse to see that people are being exploited for our money. 
Good to know, thanks for the perspective 
About to? Child labor isn't recent news.
They are paying for the raw material. They literally go to a vendor of sorts and say "hey I need 100 tons of this raw material" and then another local company sells it to them. That local company buys it from abunch of smaller groups and family farms. Somewhere in the mix are kids working, now you can loosely state that the US company is using kids to pick their raw materials. You could use the same logic to say that /u/Punxsatownyphil hired children to make him a laptop. Punxsatownyphil hired Sony to provide him with a laptop. Sony then contracted a computer chip company to provide a unique chip to this computer. That chip manufacturer then contracted out the raw materials to a resource supplier. That supplier contracted out the labor to local groups who have some kids mining Palladium out of a mine in South Africa. Fuck you /u/PunxsatownyPhil you sweat shoppin mother fucker. 
So child labor is all our fault since we buy goods and since "every company does it" we should just be ok with it? I mean, articles pointing it out and shedding light on the companies involved is surely a good thing to come to some sort of fix for the problem, right? But instead you want to just shame everyone like we have an actual hand in the child labor going on. 
Damn, HP did something right for once 

Also who the fuck used thantalium resistors anymore?
They force us to buy these products, because yes we are forced since it is impossible to live in this country without having to utilise electronic devices and it is pretty much illegal to live off the land permanently anywhere then you turn around and BLAME US for this issue?

Go fucking fuck yourself, you piece of fucking shit.
Its not the same business, there they contract sums out. like I need "100 tons of cocoa beans, who can provide this amount for the cheapest" They send it out to bid, and some various local companies say they can gather that amount up from buying it from a whole bunch of small family farms for 300k USD. Nestle gives them the contract. This company then goes out and buys cocoa beans from family farms through their own sub contracts. Most of those farms use their kids for extra labor. Boom now you have a story that you stamp a title of "Nestle uses kids to harvest cocoa beans" simply to hurt them economically.  
Great comment. Very subtle. Who gives a fuck what fucking Breitbart thinks?

Name any group and I promise you some other group considers them terrorists. Unless it's something like ultranationalist militias, where it's much, much easier to find people that recognize them for the pieces of shit that they are.
Probably more climate related actually, because some things only really grow in certain places, and if they weren't getting paid for something that grows only there, they wouldn't be part of the world economy at all. 
They seem to be doing a great job too. 

There's about 100+ people in the comment section of the 'Kelloggs pulling advertising from Breitbart' post who are giddy and promising to buy Kelloggs everything because Kelloggs stopped advertising on a website with different political views than the people commenting. Also plenty of folks posting the contact info for Kelloggs and encouraging people on "their side" to write Kelloggs and tell them how great they are for pulling ads from a website they don't agree with and don't read anyway.

This division between the "left" and the "right" is honestly making everyone fucking insane. I've *never* in my life seen so many "liberals" happy with censorship and angry at transparency just because it's for or against their "side", and I've been very left leaning my entire life.

I wish everyone on *both* "sides" would take a step back and look at what's actually fucking happening to **all of us**.
No, you have a list of suppliers and you are suppose to audit them. otherwise how do you insure basic quality and safety. or is it ok for a company whose supplier cut the milk with melamine to disclaim all responsibility ?
[deleted]
I think it's important to recognize how the demand we create contributes to the system.
That really could have helped us with the whole War on Drugs thing. 
It's too available. It's hard to resist.
True, true. How can Nestlé possible ever know? It's not like they are international mega corporation who can afford to hire [people to keep an eye on their supply chain](http://www.nestle.com/csv/rural-development-responsible-sourcing/responsible-sourcing) to ensure ethical labor practices. That would be insane.
The commercial oil palm is actually native to Africa. They're being grown in Indonesia because it's currently easier to exploit Indonesians and their land (rainforest clear-cutting). Many of the workers are brought from the Philippines and the business owners are not Indonesians either. This is not helping Indonesia. I'm not sure why Indonesia needs to "be part of the world economy" anyway.
The problem is the number of cups in the stack. A certain ethical clothing company (can't remember which) recently announced they switched their cotton supplier because after many years they finally discovered the company that sold material to the company that sold the material to theor supplier bought from a local company that used child labor.

It should absolutely be done, we should make sure these things aren't happening, but I won't sit here like an ignoramus and pretend it's an easy job
Multinationals don't respond to boycotts.

They just open another shell company and sell their product under a different name until people either forget the boycott or catch on. The multinational Capitalists have already Innovated their way around the threat of the "informed consumer."
My clothing got a lot more expensive when I started triple checking the supply chain on what I wear, but at least when I put my pants on in the morning I have a leg to stand on when I call people out on supporting modern slavery.
The united states has an unlimited amount of money. It is a billion nestles. The US cannot even scratch the surface of the illegal immigrant labor force. They have cameras on every corner of this place, they have armed guards paroling the street. They have everything at their will, and they even force the employers into taking costly measures into their own hands. So how the fuck do you expect a fucking chocolate milk company to be able to prevent any illegally working individuals from having business dealings with them when they do business with hundreds on millions of people in multiple 3rd world countries spread out all over the world? YOU CANT
The business owners are often Indonesian, they're just not ethnically Indonesian. Chinese Indonesians have been living in Indonesia and near the top of the economic chart there for a long time. 

(They also tend to get killed because they're "the rich Jews" to a minority of Indonesians minds. Straight up 1934 Germany style.)
They have a population of over 200 million. Of course they should be a part of the world economy if they want to.
So you spend more on clothing so you can talk down to those who dont or cant afford to? I'm confused by this logic, it seems you are doing it to feel self righteous and shame others rather than to stop child labor/slavery
Yes, but child labor still isn't black and white. A lot of families rely on having children who can work to help bring in money to survive. 

So if you start boycotting and manufacturers begin canceling contracts with companies who have child labor, how will these families survive?

It's a lot tougher than it seems.
Gee, I dunno. You'd think if random reporters can easily find this stuff a mult-billion dollar corporation who has an entire department dedicated to uncovering it would be able to see if small children were laboring out in the open sun. But hey, maybe Nestlé decided to fill that department with blind people so they can tell us all about how they care by hiring the disabled.
Do you think exploitation of their children and workers by multinationals is a good way to do that?
Gee you'd think the United states of america could keep an illegal immigrant and wanted felon off of job site, yet i could walk down the street and find one in 15min. Fuck off.
I guess so, it seems to work and has worked for the USA. 
We aren't talking about immigrants or the USA. This is specifically regarding child labor in Indonesia and big companies like Nestlé. Did you even read the article?
Laws aren't going to stop Capitalists from maximizing their profit at every level of business. The incentive for profit is simply too great to ignore.
Without the incentive for profit, we would still be in the stone age. 
Reviewers are "paid for" advertising? Who would have ever guessed... 
I guess I am going to add independent breakfast professional to my resume. I've been eating breakfast without outside influence for decades.
Is everyone realizing the media lies in 2016? 
When I grow up I want to be an "Independent Breakfast Expert".  Freelance waffles never tasted so good.
[deleted]
The whole reason Kellogg's exists in the first place is because their founder and his brother were batshit crazy and believed breakfast cereal would decrease the rate of masturbation in the country. 
Next you'll tell me that doctors don't recommend Camels.
Who the fuck thought fruit loops and frosted flakes were healthy?
Independent breakfast expert. Where do I apply?
I'm just looking for ethics in cereal journalism.
I never listen to what the "experts" say about breakfast cereal anyways.

YOU PLAYED YOURSELVES, KELLOGG!
Tree people should boycott Kellogg's  over their treatment of [Michael Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps#Controversies)

Yeah, like we didn't see that one coming.
That's because nobody would eat that shit unless you paid them. 
First, they got people to [mutilate their dicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCSWbTv3hng), and now this. Great company.

Prison time for these crooks, this is unjust and they should be in prison. 
Why do people eat this crap? I hate cereal give me a bacon egg and cheese
What?   Marketing masquerading as journalism?  How could this happen?!
Unless you're talking about breakfast in general, cereal as a breakfast food started as a marketing campaign even if it was before most of us were born. 
You wouldn't be eating that shite in the first place if you were.
Perfect breakfast macro ratio according to the nation's leading independent breakfast experts.

 That's what they have brainwashed people into doing for a very long time. 
I mean it worked, I usually only jerk off before and after breakfast. I can't remember the last time I did it during breakfast.

 Yeah,great start to getting diobesity.
Don't forget "Part of a balanced breakfast" when eaten with bacon, eggs, fruit, and a glass of orange juice and milk.

IE, if you are already eating a balanced breakfast, adding this doesn't make it "unbalanced".

Wow, I've never seen someone get so hurt over cornflakes.
The strangest thing just happened. I upvoted your comment and was immediately struck by a bolt of lightning.
It's because they started putting sugar on corn flakes. Get's em all antsy in the pantsy.
Okay, so, demand for breakfast cereal is declining, and Kellogg's determined that they're over capacity on future production, so they're closing at least one plant, probably two. The union is saying:

> “Instead of them coming to us and wanting to work with us on increasing efficiency, they would rather take from us."

Err... if they increased the efficiency of their remaining plants, wouldn't that mean they'd be *even more* over capacity, and could perhaps shut down three to maintain profitability? I don't see how that would help the union.
As of right now, Kellog stock is trading at $65.80 a share - down about $3 from their all time company high in April 2014.

Still, if you brought Kellog stock say in March 2009 when it traded at $36.63 per share and cereal sales were still declining, you'd have a very positive return on your investment.

Seems to me that there may be other motive forces at work deeper than the one being presented
After they close the one or two plants it will be interesting to see how much production is outsourced and how many Mexican and Canadian non-union workers get the jobs.
That grrrrrrrrrrrrreaaa^aaa^aa... nevermind.
Maybe if they weren't selling a box of cereal for 5 bucks a pop cereal sales might increase.
Unionized companies always announce their closings during the Christmas season. 
Let me see if I've got this straight.  The demand for cereal is declining, leaving Kellogg's with excess production capacity.  So rather than trim down their capacity to meet demand, they tried to just pay everyone less?  Why?  To artificially prop up employment figures?  What's the goal here?  What use is having a job if it doesn't pay enough for you to survive?

To be clear, this is why I believe unions are still necessary.
The [Boycott Kelloggs](http://boycottkelloggs.blogspot.ca/) movement grinds slow but sure.

We almost remember Michael Phelps.

Is CEO/upper management taking pay cuts?  Probably not.  Leave it to the good ol' worker to sacrifice for the good of the company...
edit: Just noticed all of the anti-union garbage in here and I'm *shocked*.

Not really. A nation of undereducated idiots who have been clinging to the idea of trickle down economics, who worship the wealthy and worship corporations and they're anti-worker and anti-union? **I'M SHOCKED**.

No, really. You idiots are part of one of the countries with the WORST inequality in the world. You barely have any middle class to speak of anymore and you're all stupid enough to have bought into the bullshit that the republicans have been selling America for the past 30 years because you never, ever educated yourselves on what unions created in America and for America. (the middle class, for one thing. You may have heard about it. Then again, knowing the reddit demographic, you probably *haven't*.)

You're a bunch of people who are stupid enough to stand around picking your noses while workers in America spend 40+ hours at their job per week and STILL qualify for food stamps and STILL are in poverty and STILL cannot have any safety or much comfort. 

And you're *still* stupid enough to think that unions are *bad* somehow? You're the worst of the worst. I can excuse lack of education and poor education (which most of you suffer from) but I cannot excuse plain ignorance and idiocy. 

So enjoy the fact that most of you will never be able to retire and none of you will ever have any job security and none of you will make a fair wage. You're too dumb to stand up in solidarity. You're too dense to realize that the workers actually hold all of the power *so long as they are part of an informed, ethical community*. 

You're too dense to realize that the only reason the middle class existed in America in the first place is because workers were smart enough and brave enough to do what these workers are doing at Kelloggs…to not give in, to not hand over their rights and their hard work for nothing in return.

Enjoy living with mommy and daddy, enjoy never being able to pay off your student loans, enjoy being a lapdog and sycophant to your wealthy masters. NOBODY deserves it like a bunch of self-loathing, undereducated twats who get their information from Fox News and the very anti-union folks who want a population of people stupid enough to work for slave wages and no benefits. 

Well, they got 'em in spades in America…the country with the worst equality that is run by a handful of ultra wealthy who employ a bunch of undereducated idiots who are stupid enough to lap at the nuts of the wealthy for  a chance to work 40 hours per week and still remain in poverty.

That's right..you guys have all the answers. That's why your lives are so good right now and why the 85% of you who describe yourself as "middle class" are scrambling to make rent and don't even have enough money to order a pizza tonight if you wanted to. 

Workers better start fucking standing up and holding tight or *no* job will be safe. THIS IS WHY UNIONS EXIST, YOU IDIOTS. To give workers a voice and an opinion. Otherwise, everyone will be like fucking Papa John workers where they're basically slaves and robots that get told how and why and what to do.

And just because someone is paying you a mediocre wage doesn't mean that they own you.

Jesus, I weep for the future. I realize Redditors aren't a balanced view of what the future in America will be like (thank fucking god) but it's a good indication that a bunch of undereducated idiots who think they have all the answers will continue being content as the lapdogs of inequality and the twats who have no backbones, no balls and no brains to stand up and fight for what's left of the middle class.
I wonder how long it'll be till all these companies start realizing that not hiring people, not paying decent wages, etc. is going to hurt all companies when people can't buy their products.

Why is breakfast cereal in decline? I assure you, it's not because people hate the stuff, it's just so damn expensive now. The off brand stuff in the bags that a lot of people turn their nose up to tastes practically the same, you get more and pay less.
Sound like blackmail to me
Sometimes I don't feel bad for unions and this is one of those cases. Kellogg's relies on sales of cereals and foods that have little if any nutritional value, and charges too much for too little as a result. I don't buy their products anymore. Consumer demand for those products is falling across the country, it isn't just me. Capitalism 101, when your product booms you hire more workers, when your product busts you fire them, diversify, or go out of business. 

It's the same with the coal miner unions. I have little sympathy for the people who cling to that mineral as a way of life despite likely knowing how badly they have been fucked over in past negotiations or knowing how much what they do ruins the health of entire communities and the environment. 

When unions get greedy, this is what happens.  There is such a thing as demanding too much.  Using collective bargaining isn't a failsafe.  
  Time to dump their stock!   We already knew that we were going to fire folks and close plants - we just wanted to do it even more cheaply than this.

   Bastards!
Wow...a company caring about its bottom line rather than its workers.....how surprising.
It's not charity, it's capitalistic business focused on maximizing profit.  I never get why unions and many of these factory job "working class" fail to grasp this.  "Handouts" come in many forms.  If you are being paid for a job that's not essential, are not qualified for your job, if someone can do your job just as well cheaper, and/or you are being overpaid for said job, you're receiving a "handout".  I'm not saying I agree with the greed and dehumanization of American capitalism, but that's how it works.  Also, in my experience with unions the union cared far more about my union due than me.  It's about money for ALL involved.
[removed]
have a merry christmas you parasitic union scum!
Yeah the plant shutdowns seem unrelated to the refusal. If the workers are cheaper they would still be over capacity. 
In my experience with auto industry, labor unions are almost purposely ignorant of the financial situation of their associated manufacturing facilities. 

It's part of what killed the industry in Detroit. Demand was down, people weren't buying cars. The manufacturers went to the unions to figure out a way to survive, since they had to cut costs and reduce production levels, which would mean pay cuts and/or reductions in the work force. The unions refused, supposedly trying to protect their members (and their own relevance). Some plants collapsed or moved to more friendly environments in the South. Most all the workers were then left unemployed or forced to move.
> “If the Agreement is not accepted on December 4th, I firmly believe that, with the excess capacity that currently exists, Kellogg will close one (ready-to-eat) cereal plant very soon,” Durkee said in the Dec. 3 letter. “With the tonnage declines expected for the industry in 2015, it is highly likely a second plant will close shortly thereafter. **Any capacity needs not met by the remaining two RTEC plants would simply be moved to their non-union plants in Mexico and Canada or dispersed into co-manufacturing networks.**”

Modern management theory, sub-contracting and offshoring. Vulture capitalism 101. 

[Funny how Kellogg's Co. has enough cash to consider acquiring United Biscuits a British biscuit company for $3 billion.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/us-kellogg-unitedbiscuits-idUSKCN0HS00920141003).

The fact is that taking from the worker is the whole purpose of so much of management theory and variations of supply-side and Chicago school economic styles. I know, I'm supposed to acknowledge the holiness and perfection that is modern capitalism, and just submit to the needs of the bottom line. That's what a worker is supposed to do.
It's more likely that the contract requires the employer to consult with the union on such matters rather than delivering ultimatums.  

you are allowing logic and reason to cloud your judgement.
kellog owns how many bands of cereal, and the best way to grow demand is to grow the population with immigrants....
According to the God of Japanese Industrial revivial, Edward Demmings, 85% of the problem at American auto plants are the fault of management. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Japan_Can..._Why_Can%27t_We%3F)

> Bill Conway: Many of these programs on statistics have died in American companies because they didn't get the top management support. Now, why top management does not believe that this is the way the Japanese have improved their industry over the last 30 years I don't know.

> Dr Deming: I think that people here expect miracles. American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan—but they don't know what to copy!

> Lloyd Dobyns: But one part of Deming’s program is not likely to please them. He insists that management causes 85% of all the problems.

> Dr Deming: I ask people in management what proportion of this problem arises from your production worker. And the answer is always: All of it! That’s absolutely wrong. There’s nobody that comes out of a School of Business that knows what management is, or what its deficiencies are. There’s no one coming out of a School of Business that ever heard of the answers that I'm giving your questions—or probably even thought of the questions.



Union doesn't need logic or basic understanding of markets

They want and by god you better give or else

They keep this up they're gunna end up like hostess and they'll all be out of jobs

The whole point of a union is to have a symbiotic relationship,  not parasitic.
Here's the thing from the worker's viewpoint-they do what they do really well.  Cereal is pretty cheap and it taste good but people aren't buying it.  That is a marketing problem, an executive problem, but they aren't going to fire any executives.
>Okay, so, demand for breakfast cereal is declining 

it it? are there independent studies confirming this? I see no conceivable reason for it.

>Kellogg's determined that they're over capacity on future production. 

sounds like a whole lot of kellogg's problem. if they asked you to cut your salary and benefits tomorrow what would you say?
Stock price is not, strictly speaking, entirely indicative of a company's prospectus unless you buy into the perfect market theory, which nobody really does.

For example, stock prices have continued to rise despite seemingly flat profits in many industries on the back of loose monetary policy.
I was combing through the financials on yahoo finance and there were lots of spikes and drops that made me think I needed to go through the press releases around those times for more information. 

Check out the 5YR and note where the stock price increases and where it drops. 

Warrants additional investigation, for sure.
They already closed a 100+ year old plant in London, Ontario,  Canada this year. Memories of smelling the cereal being made as I drove by as a kid...
Probably will end up with the exact same manufacturing capacity they have now with half the american workers. but don't try and imply corporations may be lying to push out unions and outsource workers, you'll just get downvoted
Cool story: Tony's design was a contest winner. As in, Kelloggs made a fortune off an image being given to them for free.


Some companies would rather everyone have a temporary shared burden than laying some people off.
You know, you can still find a job while you're currently working one. Personally, I'd rather take half my pay while I hunt for a new job than take no money, which is what will happen now.

The unions want to play the hard line, and plant closures happen as a result. Look at Hostess and twinkies. Believe it or not, plant management is not 100% committed to fucking over employees. Sounds like they tried to keep people in jobs, at less pay, versus just lay them off.
> So rather than trim down their capacity to meet demand, they tried to just pay everyone less? Why?

When you reduce capacity (in terms of production) you run fewer production lines. Fewer lines means more people standing around twiddling their thumbs. 

>What use is having a job if it doesn't pay enough for you to survive?

That's the problem - they have more labor than is needed. $18/hr for a low-to-no skill manufacturing job is a boon. It also has a half-dozen other perks (as listed in the article) that are costly and detrimental when sales are declining. Retiree insurance? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP. I work for a great company with great pay and benefits and I had to develop a skillset to be competitive in this field. And I don't even have access to most of those benefits.

According to the article, the company wanted to change the benefits package and that's what the union rejected. So the alternative was a reduction in the benefits package or elimination of positions. 

Can you guess which option they chose? (Hint: it wasn't the one that would contribute to continued employment.)
There are a few reasons that a company may want to do what Kellogg is doing.

First off, keep people on staff who have worked in the position for years have valuable experience and if the pay cut was temporary meant that rather than laying people off and paying them not to work, they are still productive at a lower rate. In the event demand picks up your efficiency in production doesn't take a massive hit from either shifting experienced workers from their current shift to other shifts in order to train new employees, while their previous shift replaces them with green folks who also need training. 

Also we don't really know what the pay level of the workers was or what the cut would do. I suspect it would have still been a perfectly livable wage.  One thing to understand is the union in question is the exact same one that forced Hostess to go through it's rapid restructuring after it refused to take the same paycut several other unions more than happily took. 

I think you got it backwards here. 

Trimming down means letting people go. Sure everything stays great for those who get to keep their job, but for those who get cut it's not so good. 

So everyone could take a pay cut, and everyone can keep their job, and the benefits that go with it. I don't know about cereal unions, but I know construction unkind require you to work X amount of hours to qualify for a pension credit and health insurance benefits. Not to mention, unemployment is never the same as your real wage. 

I'm not sure on the specifics in this case, but if that is how it went down then that's really not a shitty thing for Kelloggs to do. (Provides demand is as down as everyone is saying it is and the cuts are legitimate)
Let's be clear, by "trim down their capacity," you mean fire people and close plants.  

For the people who keep their jobs and stay on at the same wage, they might be fine with that, but the people getting canned probably wouldn't be too thrilled.
In the face of overproduction a factory line worker become superfluous, while an executive still has the same workload.
How would them taking pay cuts help with the fact that they are producing way more than they are selling?
"That's right..you guys have all the answers. That's why your lives are so good right now and why the 85% of you who describe yourself as "middle class" are scrambling to make rent and don't even have enough money to order a pizza tonight if you wanted to. "

Do you even have a clue as to how many "intelligent" union employees still live pay cheque to pay cheque, drinking and smoking and spending their money on toys, because they have this notion that because they are in a union that they are forever "protected" LOL
People are stupid because they are just stupid. Union jobs do nothing for people's intelligence. I agree unions have made lives of many people better over the course of time. Things like safe work places and better wages and benefits. Many of those issues are legislated now for the benefit of employees and yes thanks to unions for a lot of that. Unfortunately, it has gone too far to the other side. Unions have too much power.

So Unions are part of killing 2 plants resulting in many job losses and your genius idea is unions need to be stronger...

This. 
Generic cereal is a hell of a lot cheaper, and tastes pretty much the same. Kellogg's is also way overpriced, especially for their 'healthier' cereals. Check your supermarket sale flyers...you never/rarely see healthy cereal on sale. It's always $2 for a box of Fruit Loops or Honey Smacks or some other junk cereal. People don't want that anymore. Kellogg's makes lots of good, healthier cereal but I'm not going to pay $5 for a tiny box of it. 
And the boxes are so goddamn fucking slim.  I remember when boxes were hefty things.  Now you feel like you are buying a magazine of cereal.  Yeah fuck that, I'm eating eggs.
You just 100% contradicted yourself in that post. Part of the reason the prices are so high is that wages are so high. The off brand stuff is most likely made by a cheap, non-union plant, hence labor costs are lower. You can't have high wages and cheap stuff, it's not the way finances work.
I really don't think cost is the leading factor in cereal's decline. It's the push for "healthier" options. Cereal is probably still one of the least expensive breakfast options.
Oh, yeah, a company that sells overpriced stuff and then wonders why its not working out... must be the fault of its staff. Alternatively, if you're shit isn't selling you compete with a lower price/better product. *That* is Capitalism 101. Whether or not you have sympathy with people trying to cling onto a living from a multinational corporation, or a coal mine, is absolutely irrelevant. 
Its the unions fault that kellog managment has a bad bussinees model you make zero sense
How is this a union being greedy.  For years Kellogg's has been aware of changes in consumer preferences but has refused to widen their product offering.  Further complicating Kellogg's issues is management's acceptance and promotion of various agricultural techniques and products that have further limited the appeal of Kellogg's products overseas.  

Kellogg is NOT a study in union caused harm but rather management inattention coupled with management's lack of foresight.  They used to be among the best managed companies....that was a long long time ago.


This isn't a union thing, it is workers not wanting to have their benefits cut, when the management is mis-managing the company.  

Your type of mentality makes me sick.
That's literally how businesses work.  To make money.  They're not charities.  
Automation isn't just coming, it's here.  What would you do, in your world?  Pay workers less and less and less and less until finally, even at China sweatchop wages, machines are cheaper?  And then what do you want all these jobless, low skilled production workers to do?  Die?  Shine shoes?

No, that's just ridicuous and cruel.  You'd rather establish a guaranteed social floor and make sure all humans are treated with dignity and respect regardless of their education level.  Look at your desk right now - eventually they'll replace you with a computer program or five outsourced Indians at half your rate.  Then where will you be?
at first I thought you were using satire... but it seems you might actually be serious. 
Yes, there is corruption and some stupidity with unions, but I live in a right to work state which is great while the company/government takes care of you.... and hopeless when a loon is in power. 

Our state workers always used to have better insurance/retirement options than private workers, which offset the lower salary and actually attracted good talent (and are not allowed to unionize). You put some assholes in office that take away those perks and not increase salary and we're losing some great workers - just saying that while you can disagree with unions on some issues the fundamental thing is that they represent people and their concerns better than most of our bought-out politicians. 

Not to mention that we have weekends, overtime pay, 40 hour work weeks thanks to americans organizing against big business - no one can EVER argue that a corporation would let these things exist if they didn't have to... 

as a last note, if politicians really represented their constituents and not their donors then unions would be unnecessary. instead you can be fired in my state for joining a union -- think about that
Explain something to me.  In this article, Kellogg's admits that they have to close some plants because they have excess capacity due to declining demand.  What part does the union play in that?  If they have to lower production anyway, why does a decrease in employee benefits have to accompany that? 
So if I appeal to my employer for better pay/working conditions, then I'm selfish?

The labor movement has helped tremendously in improving the lives of workers and their families over the last century.

The problem with unions is that their leadership is tainted with greedy bastards that act in their own self-interests, not in the interests of the workers.
I missed the part in the article were Kellogg ceos were losing thier retirement benefits and getting a pay cut
 You realize how hard people fought in the early 20th century for a fair wage and reasonable working conditions? Your argument sounds so much like the writings from conservatives in those days it's stunning. Kellogg will be fine. It's very likely an idle threat but if they close the plant it will be due to greed and nothing more. If you want to go work tough factory jobs for no benefits and $8 an hour go right ahead. They chose to value themselves. When white collar workers hold out for more money it's commended but blue collar ones do it and it's selfish. So absurd. 
Yes, union's were also so greedy in wanting a 40 hour work week, safe working conditions, and fair wages. Sheesh, goddamn unions ruining everything. /s
>If the workers are cheaper they would still be over capacity.

But the savings to the owners could add up to one more ivory backscratcher!
But tell me- Would the CEO and other top members of the auto industry take pay cuts along with their production workers?
Failure to invest in their product and their plant is what killed Detroit.  
In my experience with various unions, most unions are very well aware of the financial aspects of their associated companies and industry at large.  Further, the unions were also typically well informed of the management poor decisions that, more often than not, were the cause of their company's woes.  

Your focus on the car industry is particularly poorly placed.   Business study after business study place the blame for Detroit woes and the auto industry's woes far more on the shoulders of management than the unions.  
Kellogg made $1.8 billion in profits last year.  I can assure you, the union leadership knows PRECISELY how much they are making and uses that during the negotiations.
>experience with the auto industry.

I used to do a lot of organizing with different unions, and I gotta tell you, UAW is a completely different breed of labor union. They're outright *weird*. Can't park non UAW cars on their property, they don't accept mail from FedEx (non-union), and a bunch of other backwards bylaws.

UAW is weird as fuck and is not representative of labor unions as a whole. 


(Big ups to SEIU~)
Labor costs are less than 10% of a vehicles selling price.  If they had halved that to 5% it wouldn't have mattered a bit.
Umm, no. Go read a financial statement for the big three:   
Here's one:   
http://www.gm.com/content/dam/gmcom/COMPANY/Investors/Stockholder_Information/PDFs/2013_GM_Annual_Report.pdf     
   
Page 23, 2/3 of their expenses are materials, the remaining 1/3 covers *everything else*, including labor, engineering, warranty, recalls, *everything*. They give rebates that are higher than their labor costs per unit are.      
    
The real reason they were in trouble is because they let their car business go in favor of high profit margin SUVs and trucks and got screwed on the gas prices. The same thing happened to them in the 70's, gas went up and good quality high fuel economy small foreign cars got a look at by consumers they hadn't before and their sales tanked.     
   
Oh, and the UAW is well aware of the financials of the big three, they always have been, how do you think they used to pick strike targets decades ago when there was an actual strike threat from them?   
What killed the industry in Detroit was a decade of shitty cars vs quality cheaper cars coming from Japan.  Unions were just the scapegoat.  They blamed the poor quality on unions. 

Edit: corrected wrong Asian country...
"HUR DUR, I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH A UNION, HUR DUR, THEY KILLED DETROITS."

I *guarantee* you've never studied the labor movement in America. You realize neither why the unions were formed nor what they were able to accomplish (which, in part, was to create the middle class, ensure fair wages and keep workers safe…that's just the tip of the iceberg).

You fools deserve your slave wages and your walmart jobs where you can still qualify for food stamps after working  40+ hour per week. I genuinely mean that.

And the one thing I lament the most about the internet is one undereducated twat trying to convince everyone how "informed" and "well studied" he is even though he has the intellectual capacity of a 12-year-old and an education to match.

Your anecdotal experience doesn't mean shit and it certainly doesn't prove anything, particularly with Detroit or the auto industry. Last time I checked, those people are making 20X the amount Walmart workers are earning and the American auto industry is doing better than it's done in 25 years. 

"Hur dur, unions are bad, i read about it in my community college course that i had to drop out of so I could keep my job at Taco Bell, hur dur!"

Gotcha. 

Everyone listen up! This well-educated, well-studied young man is breaking it down for you so upvote him. He's clearly very intelligent and is offering up some sage anti-union advice for a country where inequality is at record levels. 
The management has area for blame as well. Being from Detroit, during the whole bankruptcy and bailout it was pretty obvious the UAW was living on a different planet. They wanted to give nothing up and as a result, plants closed and a huge number of jobs got shipped down south or mexico. Which cut costs and they didn't have to deal with the UAW bullshit anymore. Also didnt ever hear about the UAW leadership taking a pay cut, even though hundreds make over six figures a year.

Also all you have to see is how poorly the southern auto workers received UAW reps when they tried to get involved down there. Which by the way also led to the raising of union dues by 25% on their workers in part due to shrinking member base and this failed expansion campaign.

So you watched Fox News?

Have an angry older relative that lost a job once and blames unions?
I'm a leftist obamabot, but I think in a lot of cases unions have overstepped their bounds and harmed their companies - and therefore their employees - more than helped.

Hostess comes to mind, as well.
>Funny how Kellogg's Co. has enough cash to consider acquiring United Biscuits a British biscuit company for $3 billion..

Funny how some people have no idea how most mergers and acquisitions are financed and assume [companies are just sitting around with billions in cash](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=K+Key+Statistics).
Having the cash has nothing to do with needing or not needing the plants. If they were to sink money into unneeded workers, they wouldn't have the funds available to buy another company and their product line.

If they choose to buy the company, do you think they will make the biscuits in the UK were labor and transport costs are very high, or do you think they will manufacture them in North America?
What's with the offshoring hate?  Don't people in other countries deserve jobs too?
[hostess was the fault of unions?](http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/12928-hostess-failure-not-unions-fault)
If there were no shitty management, there would never be unions. 
People aren't buying it because it's disgustingly bad for you. 
Honestly, the people who I would expect to have the most information, knowledge, and prediction ability for cereals would already work at some place like Kellogg - and it's not likely they need an independent study confirming an internal prediction on the futures market to make a business decision based on it.

If the choice was between having my salary and benefits cut vs. losing my job entirely? Tough choice. Would depend on how much either way. If it was going to be too much of a salary cut, I'd find another job regardless.
I can say, anecdotally, there has been a 100% decrease in the cereal-eating demographic in my household since I turned 16.  And i used to eat *a lot* of cereal.  So most of the drop in demand has come from me.  Sorry, Kellogg's workers... :(
[Yes parents are avoiding surgery breakfast foods, also people skip breakfast more frequently, and other quick breakfast alternatives make it to market.](http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Boomers-or-bust-Is-the-10bn-US-breakfast-cereal-market-in-a-state-of-terminal-decline)
Cereals Begin to Lose Their Snap, Crackle and Pop

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/business/cereals-struggle-in-us-as-tastes-and-rituals-change.html
There is a lot more to choose from now in a typical grocery store. Every doctor in the developed world is advising their patients not to eat things like cereal. It's not a question of whether the demand for their cereals is declining, but how much and how fast. 
Cut your salary or you lose your job. Most of the population doesn't get that as an option.  

The company was willing to run two factories it can do without so a bunch of people could keep current benefits and a job.  The union doesn't really have much to complain about.
There was an NPR story about it a few months ago.  Cereal consumption is declining as yogurt becomes the trendy breakfast choice.
No, they don't want their unemployment insurance rates to spike. It also gives them the opportunity of shedding some insurance obligations. It's a game of attrition being waged by management. 
What makes this sound like a temporary situation?  Do you think people are just a few months away from suddenly eating a lot more cereal?
What makes this temporary?  If the market is declining, then the market is declining.  The demand isn't there.  It doesn't mysteriously return.

What they were trying to do was to lower wages, *and then* shut down the plants once the wages were lower.
Sorry, but I just don't see how you can blame a union for the closure of a plant that a company has admitted they don't need any more.  

>The reality is that significant challenges remain — the (ready-to-eat cereal) category continues to decline and that leaves us with far more production capacity than we need in our U.S. cereal network,

This is not an issue of pay. It's an issue of having too many employees.  When you have too many employees, you lay off the ones you don't need.  You don't drop the pay of the ones you do need to keep the ones you don't.  Would the laid off employees rather work for half pay than not work at all?  Yeah, probably.  But what about the non-laid off employees who would rather work for full pay than for half pay?

The fact that only 21 employees supported this contract tells me they either all believe they won't be the ones getting laid off, or they all believe that if lay offs need to happen, they should just happen without punishing the entire workforce.  

Also, I find this quote from the article very telling.

>“If the Agreement is not accepted on December 4th, I firmly believe that, with the excess capacity that currently exists, Kellogg will close one (ready-to-eat) cereal plant very soon,” Durkee said in the Dec. 3 letter. “With the tonnage declines expected for the industry in 2015, it is highly likely a second plant will close shortly thereafter. Any capacity needs not met by the remaining two RTEC plants would simply be moved to their non-union plants in Mexico and Canada or dispersed into co-manufacturing networks.”

This tells me that the company isn't worried about trying to keep people employed.  All they care about is trying to make the most product possible for the least amount of cost.  It's a union's sole job to protect workers against that.
Hostess' failure had nothing to do with Unions though.  So is your point that unions make good scapegoats for systemic management failures?
Intents matter more than results. Getting people fired is worth it to the unions so they can justify the dues because they 'tried'.

If the unions just went with what the company wanted what is the point of a union?
And the people who stay would be alright with a cut to their benefits made so that the company can keep employees whose jobs are redundant? There's no situation here where everyone wins. In my view however, there is one that makes economic sense. 
If less workers are needed then less managment is needed to
No. Shitty business practices are whats killing 2 plants. 
At least eggs actually have some protein.
Might be cheaper compared to other stuff, but for low income families that pinch every penny they can, buying a small box of Frosted Flakes for $3.50 vs a huge bag of the same thing just generic for $4-5 is a major factor.
The union here is basically saying they want all the same benefits without making any of the sacrifices. For the company to move forward and return to some semblance of its past profitability is going to require compromises from both labor and capitol. Labor will have to accept some form of downsizing, capitol will have to accept possibly running in the red for a while as they develop new products.

I'm largely sympathetic to labor in general, but sometimes the business itself is no longer relevant. Like dial-up internet, the horse-drawn carriage, or the telegram. 
It's not the unions fault that the business makes a shitty product, no. 

But they're trying to fight the tides here. 
Not sure how it can't be both.  Kellogg's corporate certainly did a shoddy job managing the company, but the union forced their hand in the wake of that poor performance.  If a company is losing money, it has to do what it can to correct it.  

Union members looking at it from the scope of only themselves fail to see the necessity of what corporate was attempting to do.  
Of course they don't want to have their benefits cut.  They don't want to ever give anything up, even in the wake of poor company performance.  That's the problem -- the selfish entitled attitudes.

Then again, most people are too myopic to look past themselves when it comes to anything.  
But they're lowly peasants! They should be lucky they arent slaves right? And why should management suffer for their poor decisions? They're the upper class. Suffering is for the lower class.
They offered lower compensation to keep people employed. Union said no. 
When sales are down they do lose, stock options, bonuses, etc... but thats the spoils of working hard, going to school, working long hours, etc...

I only want to work 40 hours a week, I want 100% medical paid, all kinds of paid vacation and family days, free meals etc etc etc....said no current CEO ever. They work hard and earned a place in life that gives them the wages and benefits that they earned. They worked and got promoted to achieve that status.
> Makes me sick.

Corporate shills like you make the rest of us sick.

exactly, and the fact that the voting took place at a country club just further proves this point.

naw they nearly doubled their pay (again) while demanding the unions take huge pay cuts (again)
I'm note sure if they did, but cutting their pay wouldn't have the same impact as eliminating unnecessary labor and reducing unaffordable benefits.
Agreed. Even in my Business class, while we attributed some of the problems to Unions, the bigger problem was the management themselves: The management were the one who made shitty cars.

They could have choose to follow Edward Demming's advice on quality control. But they choose not to. 

They could have designed safer cars. But they choose not to.

They could have made better cars. But they choose not to.

You can only blame the riverters and the machinist so far before the truth come out. 

Edit: I will end this with the quote from Edward Demming, the God of Japanese Industrial rebirth.

>**Lloyd Dobyns**: But one part of Deming’s program is not likely to please them. He insists that **management causes 85% of all the problems.**

>**Dr Deming**: I ask people in management what proportion of this problem arises from your production worker. And the answer is always: All of it! That’s absolutely wrong. There’s nobody that comes out of a School of Business that knows what management is, or what its deficiencies are. There’s no one coming out of a School of Business that ever heard of the answers that I'm giving your questions—or probably even thought of the questions.

So no matter what you say about Unions, the man who built the Japanese car Industry from ashes say the management is the problem. 
Having just gotten out of a labor dispute and a strike involving my union and the grocery business, I've really got to say the union was in the wrong. 

Declining sales and lower cost competition surrounding the various stores. The unions answer was raise wages, lower healthcare costs, basically make the companies expenses that they were trying to lower into am even bigger liability. It just seems bizarre to me that a private company can all but be taken over by a union. They serve a purpose, dictating how a company should be run is not one of them
> Further, the unions were also typically well informed of the management poor decisions that, more often than not, were the cause of their company's woes.

This is the bullshit that the anti-union jerkoff likes to avoid. See, the only reason Hostess went out of business was greedy union bosses who don't give a fuck about their job security, not like millionaire CEOs with golden parachutes!
It's almost like some unions would rather take everyone down with them when these situations arise.
As a non-expert, looking in from the outside, it seems like you both might be right.  Management creates a bad situation, and then Unions respond to that new situation poorly.  I have yet to read an account of any business failing that makes any party (workers or management) look thoughtful and wise.
Source? Please back up these claims if they are so numerous.

Edit: Instead of down voting me give me the sources I'm asking for.
I have to agree with you. I worked with mostly IBEW (electrical workers) but it was the UAW that instilled fear and loathing everywhere.
Fed Ex driver and delivered to the local UAW office.  Never had such a dirty look in my life from the guy who signed for it..... like it was my fault the sender chose our service.  I just gave the customary smile and "thanks for choosing Fed Ex" as I walked out the door.  Didn't look back but his may have had exploded.
If the cut the labor cost to 5%, then they would have to raise the price of the car 10%!
Japan. Not China
They had to cut something to match the prices of the foreign cars and the per car expense of just the union health insurance was something like $5k per car.  The american consumer took the better quality product at the lower cost and that was as a result of labor costs. 

This is exactly how Walmart exists today.
> I guarantee you've never studied the labor movement in America. You realize neither why the unions were formed nor what they were able to accomplish (which, in part, was to create the middle class, ensure fair wages and keep workers safe…that's just the tip of the iceberg).

You're right...60 years ago. Today's workplace challenges have to do more with globalism, technology replacing humans, and good old fashion lobbying.

Unions can only help so much with those. Look at the original post. Company offers union what it would pay. Won't accept? Oh well close up shop, move it offshore/out of state.

It's different world now. The average working man needs something more than traditional unions to protect him.


Forgive me if I don't accept "hur dur" as a coherent counter-argument.

>I guarantee you've never studied the labor movement in America.

>well-educated, well-studied young man 

That's telling. Let me guess, you're a student? No doubt your professor has taught you a *completely* unbiased view of labor? I doubt it. 

Please, keep studying, it's a valid endeavour. I, too, went to university and graduated long ago. Since then I've been gaining something more valuable: experience, or "anecdotal knowledge" as students like to refer to it.

I have "studied" the labor movement. I have "read books" and "engaged in discussions", which we graduates are wont to do after we leave school. I'm fully aware of what the unions initial intentions were, and they were good ones. But today we have federal regulations and OSHA to ensure safe workplaces and fair wages. The unions simply over extended their reach, in an attempt to gain more power and maintain relevance.


I'm an electrical engineer. For several years, I worked for an integration firm that performed automation services for various auto suppliers and manufacturers. I've been in several plants and spoken at length with managers and workers. 

The perception, fed by the unions, that management is out to screw the workers is very pervasive. The unions have fed the lie to the workers that without representation, the management would fire them in heartbeat and hire cheap, young labor, all to fill their own pockets. Never mind that some manufacturers run completely non-union shops and pay their workers very well.
[that wasn't the unions fault...](http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/12928-hostess-failure-not-unions-fault)
Exactly, corporations would never over step their bounds though right?
Offshoring = the hollowing out of american productive capacity. Also wage suppression as evidenced by the almost 40 years of wage stagnation, especially on this recent era of record corporate profits. 

If offshoring was a genuine and  moral I would support it. As it is, it allows management to have lower wages and not bother with the few worker protections that exist in the US.
Nice opinion piece

Hostess got into a labor dispute with the union. Union demanded more despite obvious drops in sales due to the health crazes going around (no corn syrup, no gluten, eat healthier, ect) they striked, they block hostess operations and production. Hostess closed down.

The union could have opened up their own line, they chose not to.
There are shitty unions just like there are shitty companies

Some lose track that the union is about the workers, not the unions power.

And if a company needs to make cuts, the union needs to stop bitching,  stop making demands,  and help soften the blow to the remaining workers while easing transition of the workers who will be getting laid off.

Attacking the company that's already having problems because the union isn't getting its way is a great way for everyone to lose their jobs.

Unions seem to forget that being in a union doesn't guarantee them a job forever. A union is just a collection of workers,  workers employed by a company. If the company is not as profitable as it was and needs to cut back to stay viable, that's just what happens in business.

If the union wants to take over and run things, they are free to. When hostess went under I dunno why the bakers union didn't just pool their money and buy the brand or open their own baked goods line. Clearly they had the training, management skills, and business sense to succeed according to all that good shit they were talking when hostess went under
What reason could you possibly have to believe that?
>Honestly, the people who I would expect to have the most information, knowledge, and prediction ability for cereals would already work at some place like Kellogg - and it's not likely they need an independent study confirming an internal prediction on the futures market to make a business decision based on it.

and the people who have the most incentive to manipulate that data to their will are also at kellogg. you're honestly just taking their word for it? and you take comcast's word for it when they tell you they need to implement data caps because of bandwidth concerns too right?

>If the choice was between having my salary and benefits cut vs. losing my job entirely? 

that is not the choice they were asked to make. they were asked to cut all workers salaries & benefits because of the threat that one or two plants could possibly closed in the future. and the people telling them of the threat have a direct incentive to pay them less regardless of how business is. You're surprised by the decision they made? It would've been ludicrous to do anything else.
gosh those evil management people reducing wages rather than firing a bunch of people. Grrr!!!!
Sure, I have no information to go off of there. I imagine that as soon as production picks up, the Union steps back in and gets salaries back in line. If it never picks up, well then accept the new status quot or move along.
Market demand isn't always linear. New products or fads change what people eat. Too much capacity now doesn't mean that will always be the case.

> What they were trying to do was to lower wages, and then shut down the plants once the wages were lower.

This isn't exactly related. They planned on closing plants, and they also tried to lower their wages. I'm sure this bidding process is allowing them to decide which plants they want to close (hint, the more expensive ones).
They would have agreed to not shut down any of the plants for the next 4 years if the union voted for the pay reduction. This was not set in stone.

I worked for a company that did voluntary hour / salary reduction for a year rather than laying people off and it helped the company get through a tough spot and built a lot of good will between the employees and management. You would be surprised how many people wouldn't mind working 4 days a week as long as the company still gave them benefits.I
In what world has intents ever been worth more than results? 
Yea, lower management, not CEO/upper management.
Sure it couldn't be mixture of both sides? People get way to invested in the us vs them mentality when it comes to unions/management. Both sides need to work together or everybody gets the shaft, but it is hard to get that to happen.
Yep and unions have all of the genius business experience and ingenuity necessary to turn the company around.  That must be why they are line workers and not running their own companies.
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they get made in the same factory.
That wasn't my point. You're comparing cereal to cereal. I'm comparing cereal to other breakfast options (eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, etc). They said that breakfast cereal sales are declining, not just Kellogg's sales.
What sacrifice are shareholders and the ceo'S making?
>Among the proposed changes were eliminations of cost-of-living adjustments and a leave-of-absence benefit, and requiring wage adjustments to be set in supplemental contract negotiations.

>It also would have established transitional employees, "a special designation of regular employee with different terms and conditions of employment" who is part of regular plant operations, according to the contract proposal. They would be paid $18 per hour.  
  
>Any employee hired after Jan. 1 — considered regular or transitional — would not be eligible for retiree health care.  
  
I don't see how any of this addresses "the tides".  No plan to restructure the business model, no diversification, and ...  
  
>The proposal would have allowed Kellogg to close a plant only "in case of an Act of God or in cases beyond the control of the Company." It would have retained the rights to determine output at each facility and announce a closure at any time, but the company would have been required to operate at least one production line at each cereal plant through October 2018.  
  
... they get to close the plants anyway!  
  
How is this not an utter failure on management's part to address the real problems with the business?  If management has no plans to do anything to fix the problem, how can the workers expect anything except more cuts in the future?  
> That's the problem -- the selfish entitled attitudes.  
  
Is upper management at the company taking pay and benefit cuts?  Or are they too contributing to the "selfish entitled attitudes"?  Why should managers be paid as much as they are if Kellogg's sales are declining?
The company's poor performance is due to management not these plant workers.  If the chief officers of the company took a massive pay cut, you would have a leg to stand on. 
No they didn't. They can lay-off excess employees but retain those who are needed while maintaining the rate of pay and benefits. What Kellogg's wants is to lay-off excess employees and cut pay and benefits for new and existing employees. This is nothing more than Kellegg's version of the race to the bottom for employee wages and benefits. 
So the ceo's earned it and the rest of us should be thankful for the scraps they allow us to have?  Your post makes no sense , ceo,s demand vacatuon raises golden parachutes and better health care your hyperbole is not based in reality 
Uhmm ok
They're still plenty useful in empowering employees to resist wage and benefit erosion. I suppose we should all just be happy to ride along with the race to the bottom and see who can work the most for the least pay. 
Oh, so companies will willingly pay fair wages as opposed to just paying the absolute minimum? If you really believe that I've got some beach front property for sale in Nevada, it's a great deal.
give it twenty years it'll be right back where we started.
K. There are valid points that unions today are not what they were before (now they are quite bureaucratic human shufflers.) However, to say there doesn't need to be a representative force who questions in insane.

That's like saying there should never be resistance or questioning to anything. That's like saying we have no social injustice and live in a perfect society.
Just saying that the people who made the bad decisions that hurt their company should suffer just as much, if not more than their production workers. Its symbolic. Im sure it'd be a lot easier to stomach a pay cut when your boss is going down with you.
"In my business class" - stopped reading there. Good for you, you're in (hopefully) college. Now don't be a dumbfuck.
Actually no, the unions did destroy Detroit with outrageous wages and benefits, and crappy quality control. Union goons would break the legs of any quality inspector that sent back too many cars.

The base pay (starting wage) of auto workers in 1980 was around $15 an hour with many veteran workers making well over $30 an hour.

To give you an idea, most families made less than $20k a year back then. Auto worker made some of the highest wages anywhere in the world, and when the economy collasped in 79-80, the unions continued to push for more money, and controlled the garbage quality control.

As a result Chrysler needed a Government bailout, and American Motors (which did not get a bailout) failed.  


 
raise wages and lower healthcare costs? its almost as if the union wants the employers to do something that will direct increase the amount of money the union takes in.... unions can make money off healthcare


Unions are basically a Mafia protection racket. Schools won't teach this history because of the politics involved. 
It's almost like blaming the ones most powerless to affect the company is ass-backwards.
let me guess every employee issue was blown up to full scale work action. Unions think that companies just have a bottomless pocket of money to give them everything they want or they threaten with job action and strikes. Unions for the most part are out of touch with reality. A typical union employee doesn't give two shits about the company they work for then get all pissed off because the business unit was squeezed to the point of a constant loss and decides to close up shop. Unions did have a place in the past and agree in some cases there is a reason for their current existence, but that whole 70's mentality of fighting the man instead of finding collaberative ways to keep a business functioning which is what really keeps an employees job. Unions can't do shit if a company simply decides to close its doors. Constantly demanding more and more out of companies making less and less is simply not sustainable.

Wow, I can't believe someone just validated that.
Wut. OSHA and federal regulations help ensure safety and good pay? Tell that to the places that I've helped organize this past year. Complain about unsafe work practices? Fired. Ask for a raise so you won't have to go on food stamps? Fired. 

Kicker is that these companies are making money hand over fist, outright violate OSHA regulations, and pay their worker force minimum wage, when that job paid $20+ hr back in the 1980's. 

These guys even contributed more than half of their paychecks to health insurance before we came around. Now they make a livable wage, decent insurance, and can make complaints without fear of getting fired.

One more thing, these aren't even the worst cases in the US that I have seen. 

Without the union can the employees directly prevent themselves from being replaced by cheap labor?  Can they prevent their pay or benefits from being reduced to increase margins?
>pay their workers very well.

I've worked in non-Union shops who competed with Unions and the pay and benefits are livable but it is a lie to say they are anywhere near equivalent to Union benefits.
Do they run non-union shops in areas full of unions?  If so often they are forced to raise wages and benefits, though they still fall short of the union shops, to actually get people to work there.  Why would I work at a non union shop that pays $15 an hour when down the street there is a union shop that pays $30 an hour.    Like it or not unions help non union shops in similar occupations.  
I didn't say corporations were free from blame.  There's plenty to go around.
Management was trying to make their numbers look better to inflate the value of the company for a sale. 
Because unions were a direct reaction of late 19th century labor practices, such as "Company Store" (Paying in "company currency" and thus trapping workers), very low pay, child labor, lack of healthcare/Insurance in dangerous environments, draconian law (barring off fire escapes that lead to hundreds of deaths), use of army/private security to quell protestors(Including shooting strikers). 

Or maybe the famous Vandervelt quote: "I can hire half of the workers to shoot the other half." 

Is the union the cure to all those ills? No, but without workers ever organizing, we would all be like that today. 
> and the people who have the most incentive to manipulate that data to their will are also at kellogg? 

why would they manipulate data to support cutting production if there is demand for the product?

do you think someone decided that instead of making all the money they can, they just want to fuck over their workers instead?
You... You have no idea how capitalism works do you?
What I'm surprised by is that the union's response was, 'Let's increase efficiency', which would make overproduction a bigger problem, not fix it.

Look, Kellogg's isn't going to shut down production they they they need to meet their sales. That'd just be leaving money on the table. They're also not going to want to let factories stand around doing nothing. It's not like they're just being Evil(tm) and shutting things down just to hurt workers - they're over production. What other choices are there besides cutting hours or cutting plants? Lobbying the government to make breakfast cereal a mandatory nutritional requirement at school?
Are you retarded? If there was stable or more demand they would increase production. Try and believe me when I say that not all companies are evil and out to make people homeless *gasp*
If they fired people they would have to offer severance/unemployment insurance. This way they can force desperate employees to look for other jobs while retaining production levels. 

What's really sad is people like yourself who ridicule people like these workers who know they are getting a raw deal hence the lopsidedness of these contract vote.

Maybe when the CEO and the board offer up wage and renumeration cuts for themselves I might not think management is so evil. But we know that will never happen.
>I imagine that as soon as production picks up, the Union steps back in and gets salaries back in line.

Lol de fucking Lol. What is surrendered will never be freely returned.
So what you're saying is that Kellogg wanted to start a Russian Roulette bidding war, where each plant offered more and more of their wages as sacrifice and then Kellogg shut down the plants that offered the least?  And the Union stopped this?

Seems completely appropriate to me.  That's what I want a Union for, so businesses can't play chicken with people's lives.  
But what happens after four years?  Do they still shut down the excess plants, fire those workers, and then keep wages low?  Or did they expect that demand would go back up and the plants would no longer be unnecessary?  It's certainly good to keep those people employed, assuming they'd still make enough to live on, but it's a net loss for the union if the ultimate situation is lower wages along with the layoffs the lower pay was intended to prevent.
> They would have agreed to not shut down any of the plants for the next 4 years if the union voted for the pay reduction.

Do they have a history of keeping such promises?  Maybe the employees didn't believe them.

That's how a union should work. Find solutions collaberatively with the employer. Let's remember that when businesses close the management, particularly the junior and middle management are equally effected. Unions have to stop this us vs them bullshit and work together. I managed work force that had the highest pay in the country in their field, more than double in many places. The problem is the customer expects the prices to be comparable to our counterparts in other parts of the country. Simply not possible given we are paying virtually the same for the same raw products. Employees had 100% medical paid for, 9 stat holidays paid a year, free uniforms, travel insurance as part of their package, Free meals on top of double the industry standard for wages. Each and every day I dealt with a workforce that questioned every decision and found a way to make it look like we were screwing them out of something or other. Constant threats of work action and the writing of countless frivolous grievances all in attempt to take paid time off of work to sit in a room and deal with them for nothing. I do beleive there is a need for unuions in certain situations but for the most part UNIONS SUCK! 

The world of the flawed human mind.
Why would you need as much upper management if you are getting smaller 
They do.
Other breakfast options require preparation and cereal is pour and eat. I suspect a lot of it is lack of time or lack of desire to spend time cooking. I also assume they're kids they're feeding this to, and it's easier to let the kids make their food in the morning then cook it.
I didn't say either side was playing fair. 


Strike across the board at all Kellogg plants? But they won't do that, modern labor management usually sells out the base and rolls over before it comes to that. 
Because they contribute more to the correction of their economical situation.  Like it or not, if you scare off your C-level officers the company will fare worse, not better.  
To be fair though executive pay cuts don't make nearly the difference layoffs/worker pay cuts make.
That's unfortunately not how corporations work.  They operate from a pragmatic viewpoint.  Scaring off the C-level officers won't bring them into the black.  
Yes they do demand all of those things, but they do things that prove they deserve those things and there is no job protection at all, but maybe that's the perks of being management. you get lots but there is no guarantee. Union employees on the other hand are content with doing the same mundane thing day after day for 25 years and expect to get more and more each and every contract negotiation for no more production or efficiency. Then management has to settle for the line "but I'm doing the best that I can" Well in the real world thats just can't always work. Employees like employers and unions must learn to shake and move to keep things moving forward together. The last place I managed the employees were paid more than management. I couldn't keep managers because of the inequality they saw. So guess what...they moved on and got another job that paid better or whatever. Choice!

There are choices in life, it's a matter of excercising that right and many low level union employees have no real aternative because they would a) never be able to work in a non-unionized enviroment where your employment is directly related to the work you do, not the contract you negotiated and b) would never get paid the money they are making in a unionized environment. They aren't doing anything that anyone else in the industry is doing yet they want so much more than anyone else. 
Vote with your feet my friend. If a company pays badly, has poor work conditions and terrible management, then what the fuck are you doing still working there?

Any job where I felt I wasn't valued or was just a piss poor place to work....guess what I got a new job and moved on. I hear so much bitching about Wal-Mart and how bad they are to work for, yet they stay in business. How does that happen? it's not like wal-mart is the only place to work in the world. 
That's like saying I walk up to two lines every day. One line gives me something pleasant and the second line gets me a smack in the head. How many times will you line up in the head smacking line? sort of the same analogy. Why keep working in a place that treats you so horribly? 

I guess you can't fix stupid sometimes.
So now we're being punitive?
LOL...union workers could care less if their boss also takes a pay cut. Unions are very much an all anout me mentality. 

Proof positive: We just negotiated a stepped wage scale for new employees. How did we get that through...easy...it didn't effect any current employees...because they only give a shit about themselves...not even their union brothers and sisters. 
sure but would you rather hold on to your pride and sense of justice or your job?
"Now don't be a dumbfuck"- why debate when you could just call names like a 5th grader?  You are about to (hopefully) graduate to sixth grade, right?
>crappy quality control.

That is not the union's job. That is the management's duty to develop proper construction techniques.

An [American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) developed the bible on quality control...and nobody in Detroit listened but the Japanese did.  
Lots of facts there, sauce please?
Calm down axe-grinder. Unions aren't stealing your immigrants any more.
Collective bargaining means that "the ones most powerless" can shut down the company if they like.  It's called a strike.
>Without the union can the employees directly prevent themselves from being replaced by cheap labor?

I'm not in a union. What's preventing my company from doing that to me? I have marketable skills, so I'm hard to replace. If someone has done the same job for years with no appreciable increase in skill or responsibility, why *shouldn't* a company replace them with someone younger/smarter/better/cheaper? That's just good business, unfortunately. A company may have a responsibility to pay a fair wage to one person, but they also have responsibility to pay a fair wage to someone else who shows initiative and skill. Move up or move out. That's life. Not everybody gets to have a union to protect them.

This is what I and others saw in the auto industry. Older union employees had figured out the game, and were near impossible to fire, and were guaranteed annual raises for no increase in value to the company. How is that fair?
History is far more complex than that. There is no way for us to view a world in which 19th century labor abuses did not occur. Therefor, it is impossible for us to say whether those practices were necessary to cause the rise of organized labor, or just sufficient.  Similarly, we cannot view a world in which workers never organized, so it is impossible to say that nothing would have changed if they didn't.

Such statements are no different than those "historical fiction" novels that explore what might have happened if the Axis Powers won WWII.  They are interesting to think about, but no one can actually *know* what would have happened.  They are, in the end, nothing more than speculation.
>do you think someone decided that instead of making all the money they can, they just want to fuck over their workers instead?

Yes. A lot of people actually believe this nonsense. 

Or close these plants now and open them again in regions with lower labor costs when demand magically increases. 
they're not. they're using this to outsource. it even says so in the link.

>Any capacity needs not met by the remaining two RTEC plants would simply be moved to their non-union plants in Mexico and Canada or dispersed into co-manufacturing networks

my guess is "any capacity needs not met" are more significant than that phrasing would lead you believe.

Every study I can find says that the decline of cereals has dramatically slowed as they've gotten healthier. So why are they doing this now instead of 5 years ago when it was far worse? Do you people really just lap this shit up and wonder why corporations run the country?


I hear Kellogg is demanding every worker's first born child and they are going to use them to create a Soylent Green type cereal. 
Sure, until you know, the plant is closed down and ruining peoples lives.
Anyone who claims they know the future of a company 4 years from now would be making a lot of money in the stock market. Faced between a small pay cut and 4 years of job security vs. a 50% chance of being laid off, I would take the pay cut. At least then you can look for other jobs and still have an income if needed.
Seeing as how it was written into the contract... Did you even read the article?
you would only reach up to the Plant Manager for the Plant being shutdown.  After that you are regional management or they may even report to a single Production Manager or a single VP and that VP reports to the Board/CEO/Principal. IF all the other plants report to the same production manager.  You can't cut his pay by 20% because of the market/ change because it is a very small drop in a very large bucket and he will leave you for a competitor willing to pay him his current salary.  Then you have to hire or promote someone else to that position who is willing to take on the stress and anxiety of keeping production up for the whole company for 20% less then the competitive rate.  The cust of rehiring a new manager and training him and getting him up to speed leaving a loss in production and extra work load on others to compensate will far out weight the 40k that you save on said production manager. 

However if your kellogg and you need to save money.. rather then cut 1 guy 40k everyone else can share the burden at lets say 1.00 an hour.   which is instead a savings of 30,200 an hour.. 241,600 a day, 1.2m a week or 62.8m a year. or you cut 10% employee force out source it to mexico where you pay 70 cents for every dollar you do in the US (saying the average salary is 32k a year). you save 28.9 million a year.   No cuts in upper management are going to even come close to saving that much money and you are still going to have someone to do the workload they do in upper management.   
It depends on how small they're getting and what the proportion of executives to line workers is.  I suppose they may lay off a regional vice president, or something, over the area where the factory closes.  Even a small town has a mayor, treasurer, police chief, etc.; the CEO, CFO, CIO, President, Director of Marketing, Director of HR, etc. are still essential to business.
If I have to choose between waking up 10 minutes earlier to prepare a bigger meal or getting extra sleep, I choose the sleep. I like cereal. I eat the healthier options, never was a big fan of the sugary stuff anyway.
kellog is making profit they are not in the red 
> Because they contribute more to the correction of their economical situation.  
  
Kellogg's is sliding in sales.  How can they contribute more to the correction of their economical situation, while not taking responsibility for contributing more to the problem to begin with?  
  
Be specific.  This should be fun.
It is about sending a message to your workers whom you can't operate the company without.   Without a public announcement of these cuts, you are very unlikely to get the workers (who make many times less) to take a pay cut that can and will cause financial issues when they suddenly aren't able to pay their morgage/rent,  car payments, child support, end etc.  
Ceos have better job protection than workers.  All work a worker does is related to thier employe contract no matter if its union or non union.  And what do you mean they want more than others?   Employees have every right to negotiate employment contracts. You just go on and on about ceos earned it guess what with out workers nothing gets produced 
Because not everyone can choose where they wish to work. Work is a requirement for survival. Don't like where you work? Then quit and possibly have no way to afford food, or provide shelter for your family.
Yes I guess so. Why should the workers be the ones to suffer? Or be the only ones to suffer?
My union does not do this. Blanket shitting on all unions is silly. And you havent answered me- Were the management willing to take cuts as well? How about the CEO? The people who made the decisions that lead to the company failing?
I dont know why you cant have both.
It's union workers that did the assembly, and union inspectors that passed the cars through. It has nothing to do with the techniques or engineering, just the fact that union auto workers were lazy as fuck and were shitty at their jobs. 

They didn't give a fuck about the product they were making, and knew they couldn't get fired.
oK, HERE YOU GO.... mostly this is from my own (I'm really old) memory. 

http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php look for 1980 

http://sbaer.uca.edu/research../allied/2003/organization/new/06.pdf
The fourth page has the wage increase regarding the base pay. Most union employees had guarenteed wage increasse every year they were there, and a pension, and lifetime healthcare after retirement.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/us-unemployment-rate-history/ look at 1979-80, and compare that to the last ecomonic collapse that just happened.

http://www.skidmore.edu/~pdwyer/amc/amc_main.htm Here's a decent article on the AMC history and failure.

Here's a good one on the Chrysler bailout.
http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/chrysler-bailout.asp

Hopefully this is enough to give you a good idea of what went on
Obviously, that explains how every union long ago ousted management and installed themselves as leaders of the company, seeing to it that the enterprise wouldn't go in a direction that necessitated gutting their workforce while remaining profitable.

Oh wait...
My favorite was the amount of people that simply didn't show up on Monday or Friday. The plant would have to keep an extra 20% employed just so a large percentage of the workforce could fuck off and have a long weekend. 
>This is what I and others saw in the auto industry. Older union employees had figured out the game, and were near impossible to fire, and were guaranteed annual raises for no increase in value to the company. How is that fair?

I think those employees would argue "Why is it fair that shareholders are allowed more and more of the fruits of our labor?"
You still have not addressed my original point, however.

How would increasing efficiency at the Kellogg plants help the situation for the union workers?
The way I interpreted that quote is that any extra needs that couldn't be met by the remaining factories wouldn't be large enough to warrant keeping an additional factory operational (AKA the profit from those extra needs doesn't exceed the cost of another factory).
If Kellogg is producing too much cereal the plant is shut down regardless.  Strikes me as all the Union did was avoid a bidding war where Kellogg uses the plant shut down to drive down workers wages.
Right, but the vast majority of workers will then have taken a permanent pay cut to allow a smaller number to temporarily keep their jobs.  So the company gets to pay their workers less while still ultimately eliminating the same number of jobs that they would have if no one had taken a pay cut.  It primarily harms the workers, other than the relatively small number who get to keep their jobs (for less pay) while looking for new work.
I see the options slightly differently.  

Option 1:

Losses
Removal of cost of living raises
Removal of leave of absence benefit
Removal of retiree health benefits for employees hired after 1/1/2015
Creation of a new "transitional" category of employee, presumably so new employees can be hired with less benefits.  

Gains
Guarantee that at least 1 production line at each plant will remain operational through 10/2018, except in the event of an Act of God or circumstances beyond Kellogg's control.

Option 2:

Losses
Possible layoff with severance pay

Gains
No reduction in pay or benefits

Frankly, the guarantee doesn't sound very secure to me and the loss of benefits go beyond a small pay cut, particularly for new employees.  

That wasn't what I asked, but nice try.

The people who actually making the products and running the machines are essential too
I'm really not trying to defend Kellogg here, mainly pointing out that the larger trend in the economy is that people are not buying the product that the union's members are chiefly employed in producing. They should be figuring out how to stay ahead of that trend instead of trying to live in the past. 


A very idealistic way to look at a business.
Wrong CEOS do not have better protection. They can be fired for a multitude of things. What I say is that any person has a choice of where they want to work. If enough people choose not to work for a particular employer because of poor pay or practices, then i suspect the business goes out of business. Have unions made us so stupid to think that because a work force is unionized they are safe from losing their jobs? Not when they push the boundaries of making a business viable. I will say that unions did great things with respects to providing safer workplaces and better wages and benefits, but many of these are now incorporated into legislation. Unions need to be more collaborative with employers when it comes to difficult times. 
Never quit a job without first securing the next one. That's just stupid. Unless of course it is a direct and imminent threat to your well being. 
That's all kinds of fucked up.  The decision isn't made because anyone's trying to make someone suffer, in fact most of these decisions are made as a way to prevent much more suffering in the medium or long term.  
Also, the people shitting on unions saying "They ask for so much and try and do everything to protect the workers" obviously miss the point of unions. Of course they ask for a lot. That's the fucking point of bargaining. You put all your cards on the table (management does the same) and trade offers back and forth.

My management came back with the offer of "Employees will no longer be able to see their remaining sick and vacation balances, they will have to ask HR". That was literally one of the points management wanted. It would have been more work to implement than it was worth if it went through, since we already had access to our leave balances.

Then unions fighting for their members, again, this happens because that IS THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF UNIONS DUMBASSES. Management is always trying to fuck over employees. Unions are there to protect them. Unions are there to fight for better conditions for everyone.
So everything that happens bad to a company is clearly the fault of management? 
thats because you're an idiot
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Japan_Can..._Why_Can%27t_We%3F

**Bill Conway**: *Many of these programs on statistics have died in American companies because they didn't get the top management support*. Now, why top management does not believe that this is the way the Japanese have improved their industry over the last 30 years I don't know.

**Dr Deming**: I think that people here expect miracles. American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan—but they don't know what to copy!

**Lloyd Dobyns**: But one part of Deming’s program is not likely to please them. **He insists that management causes 85% of all the problems.**

**Dr Deming**: *I ask people in management what proportion of this problem arises from your production worker. And the answer is always: All of it! That’s absolutely wrong. There’s nobody that comes out of a School of Business that knows what management is, or what its deficiencies are. There’s no one coming out of a School of Business that ever heard of the answers that I'm giving your questions—or probably even thought of the questions.*

Sorry, the God of Japanese Industrial revolution disagree with you.
So basically the unions sought the same benefits for their members that upper management gives themselves all the time? The horror...
Nice strawman. It would be a shame if something happened to it.

> Workers are powerless!

> No they aren't powerless because unions give them some control.

> Oh, so unions let them take over control of the company, huh?

> Blargh.

now a plant will be closed down and people will be out of a job and many people will have no income after unemployment benefits dry up. Who knows where the market will be at 4 years from now. People get fired now as opposed to maybe get fired 4 years from now. gee so much fucking better. 
Most of the stuff in option 1 is going to happen regardless. Very few large companies still offer retirement benefits. In fact, most large non-government companies have already done most of the things in option 1 except the COLI raises and the leave of absences thing.
You are trying to say a legal document isn't legally binding...
The union members do not get paid to develop kellogs businesses plans, kellogg is making money, if Kellogg would like unions members to do the ceo's job too, Kellogg will need to renegotiate its union contract. 
Get back to me when ceos are more collaborative when times are good or bad,  worker wages have not raised in thirty years but ceo wages have increased dramatically, so again nothing you say holds water
Okay but then why should it just be the production workers who suffer?
No,  but if poor decision making leads to negative consequences the people responsible should be punished first,  rather than the people at the bottom. The bottom rungs just follow orders,  while the ones making the decisions decide whether a company prospers or not. 

All I'm saying is if the people on the bottom take a pay cut so should the people on top. It's really,  to me a loyalty thing. Your leader should be willing to sacrifice,  so that their followers will be more willing. Otherwise it's just unfair. 
You're a pretty shitty person who seems content to live in a pretty shitty world. Its kind of sad :(
Gee, I guess your right, ALL the factory workers should get the same pay as the CEO!! 


Well, you're making a lot of assumptions that management doesn't also suffer.  A lot of plant manager jobs are also lost when these plants close down. But I can name a number of reasons.

1. Commodotization of labor -- most manufacturing jobs are fairly easily moved about
2. Hierarchical structure of business -- managers by their nature are the ones making these decisions.  Eliminating management and maintaining production staff is nonsensical during any situation with underutilized production capacity.
3. Breadth and scope of job -- Managers don't just manage production, they also generally have other responsibilities whereas production staff's sole responsibility is to turn out product, which they aren't needed for when they have excess capacity
Life isn't fair! But to say that a company's profitablity is strictly tied to management is bullshit. 

Here's an example....an employee signs a document that states as part of their employment that no illegal drugs should be broguht to the workplace. An employee brings a big old bag of stinky weed into his locker and expects that no one will smell it??? We call him out on it have security open his locker and boom a bag of weed in the workplace. We in turn fire the employee but of course the high and mighty self righteous union believes that the employee has a problem and we should be more considerate and allow the person to get treatment to return to work. BULLSHIT!!! I smoke pot recreationally and have never brought it to work, especially as in his case where his car was only 20 feet away from the employee entrance. You can't fix stupid, but the union tries to defend it! So now we have to pay a bunch of employees to attend as witnesses to an arbitration hearing, waste my HR manager's time preparing for a case. Then pay them to go to the hearing. Then I have to take a day off to go to the proceedings as well. Guess what? We won! 
So now we have paid 5 employees and two managers a full day's wages to defend something that we all knew was a forgone conclussion. Why because the union clearly has nothing better to do but waste our time on this and countless other grievances, but yet management is responsible for making poor decisions. How about the fact that in our first year of the operation we added an additional 30% to the workforce, but yet we are horrible becuase we expect people to be efficient. Why is it that a non-union person can do the same job across town for less money and more efficiently then the highly paid union worker? Because the cloak of invincibility covers people who are in a union. I have said it before I still believe that there is a place for some unions, but the times have changed and unions must do the same.
if a business needs to cut down on production because demand isnt there that doesnt make them evil. 
Why hello Mr. Straw man, nice to meet you!

So CEOs, upper management types and board members should be able to give themselves whatever they want, but lower-level employees should not be allowed to try to get benefits for themselves? Should they just toil in silence when profits hit new record and yet their wages and benefits are cut or stay stagnant while the CEO takes home a huge bonus?
Gmo is such a non specific term.  They gotta start at least calling it transgenic modification or everything will need to be called gmo 
Keep in mind they are doing it for a new state law and the mark is going to be "Produced with Genetic Engineering"

>The Kellogg Co. has joined Mars Inc. and General Mills Inc. in announcing plans to start complying with Vermont's first-in-the-nation GMO labeling requirements that take effect in July.

It feels like people are caving to the anti-GMO people even though we can't live without GMO foods and their is still no proof to health risks with GMO foods
Great, another step against science! One giant leap backwards for mankind?
Voluntary labeling is the way to go.
They should just own it. "GMOs, we make food better". But i think its too late to play that card?
There is no difference between being anti-GMO and being anti-vaxx.  Anti-life propaganda.
They should label daily % of sugar too.
I'm glad to know that the planet Mars has a say in this mater.  I really hinge on what its thoughts are on the subject.
What about labeling food makes it "anti"?  Aren't there tons of people who *want* gmo food because they like the way it's grown or they think it's better for you?  

I fail to see how the desire to suppress information could be considered pro-science or a vote of confidence.

Full disclosure:  i have grown seed for monsanto and also produce organic foods
Is PISS gmo?
Good step. The more companies that label GMO's the easier it will be to track those items and find if there are any negative consequences to them. 
>As we've said all along, if the Senate failed to act, consumers, farmers and companies would pay the price.  Unfortunately, it's happening as a law established by a state with 600,000 people is dictating the labeling for 300 million people.”

Rubbish. "GMO ingredients included" cannot be expensive to print on the labels.

I hope Kellogs, goes teh extra step and labels their cornflakes/rice crispies as piss falvored.

It'll probably just end up like "natural" or "antibiotic-free" stuff in that it's not actually verified and just ends up as some homogenous catch-all that doesn't really mean anything.

But monsanto is butthurt because monsanto is always butthurt.
What's the difference?
Came here to say this is going to turn out like Prop 65 warnings in California.  They'll be completely useless because they'll just get put on everything.
> It feels like people are caving to the anti-GMO people

It's quite simple, people who believe there's health benefits to eating organic or non GMO are willing to pay more for it. 

General Mills is more than happy to make more money per box on their non GMO Cheerios if suckers are willing to pay it. 

They've even removed added vitamins because those vitamins were made with genetically engineered microorganisms, and they wouldn't be able to attach the organic label so they could charge the premium price. 
A new labeling textblock that lists the genus and species of ingredients should be used instead. Most people would go back to not caring. Others would be inspired to start a garden. Big food businesses would start buying better ingredients or testing new varieties of their products because of the transparency. Small farms and cottage food businesses would boom. It's a win/win/win
[deleted]
It's hard when the multi billion dollar organic industry is working hard to demonize GMOs.
Their logic is that "it's so good for you, you shouldn't be *allowed* to know what's in it."
Maybe if companies that do gene splicing in food had done that from the beginning and spent the money on public health education rather than lobbyists and obfuscation, people would be better informed.  
Or maybe the same companies have been untrustworthy on many levels for years, despite the science, so that no one trusts a damn thing they say?
Yeah, except the vast amounts of glyphosate you are contractually *bound* to use if you grow for Monsanto, or any other dominator of the industry.

Oh, that, and threatening the entire supply of an incredible variety of naturally growing food in the world.

No biggie.
There is no difference between being anti gmo or anti vax or anti labeling.  Anti life propaganda.
They could be misleading with that, too. 

We can't use starch as is,  we use sugars, but starch is just long chains of sugars, and our digestive systems are starch cleaving machines. 

When you eat cheerios or corn flakes, you're eating mostly sugar as far as your body is concerned. 
Mars was behind the push to add Red Dye No. 2 to everything 
By your logic shouldn't we track the other DNA modification techniques (a.k.a. breeding)?
Industry resistance to labeling will only give off the impression that there's something to hide.
They see the writing on the wall now.   

[Monsanto suffers week of devastating defeats as lawmakers back away from biotech influence and intimidation](http://www.theeventchronicle.com/news/north-america/monsanto-suffers-devastating-defeats/#)  


Printing isn't the expense.

Verification, testing, enforcement are where the expense is at.
> Rubbish. "GMO ingredients included" cannot be expensive to print on the labels.

The key thing that proponents of labeling overlook is not the cost of the label; rather it's the cost of growing GMO-free food when irrational fears destroy the market for GM crops.

We have Western Europe to look at as an example in which GM labeling killed the GM industry to the extant that they're virtually non-existent. [GM crops yield about 22% more than conventionally grown crops](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629) and significantly reduce pesticide and fuel use, so would it not be reasonable to imagine these consequences would have a significant impact on food costs?
Why, exactly, are you in favor of labeling something deemed safe by thousands of studies without a single credible study otherwise? Especially considering GM technology [increases yield and reduces the use of pesticides](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629), fuel, oil, carbon dioxide emissions, tilling, and farm land. In the future, they'll be even more environmentally friendly as we work toward reducing irrigation and fertilizer demands, increasing shelf lives, tolerating stresses and extreme climates, etc.
That isnt the rice krispie line. I worked there in '14. That is the rice pisspee line
Found the guy who pissed on the line.....
Well because all grocery store genetics are modified.  Have you ever seen a wild strawberry?  They're about 1//4 the size of a blueberry.  We modified its genetics through hybridizing, splicing, hand pollinating specific mixes or generations of selective breeding.  The wild plant that corn is bred down from is basically a grass called teosinte.  Like literally none of the things you can buy in a market of any kind wouldn't be a natural existing fruit or vegetable.  They only exist through Agriculture and people's modifications of plants.  Same with things like cattle.  Cattle's wild counterpart went extinct, and humans made these animals from wild herding monsters that probably lived like Wild Buffalo or Wildebeest to these big, stupid, fat and docile animals that only now exist in their genetically modified form.

Transgenic modifying is the stuff they refer to as GMO.  It's where you modify it's genes directly to change its effects.  So you can make stuff like a Watermelon that doesn't have seeds in it and shit.  But even that isn't bad in itself.  It's just that some main priorities are pest control, which is great for locusts and stuff, but can screw up some ecosystems but apparently also does to bees.  But you can also do things like make your vegetables taste better or contain more nutrition than they normally would.  It's really disappointing that there is so much effort to throw the baby out with the bathwater with GMO's.  
This comment may contain lead.
ah good point, I guess soon there will be GMO free areas in stores : /
Thats why if youre smart youre like dean foods. Invest in both and sit back.
It's also hard to salvage your reputation when people think Agent Orange.  
But being honest, ethical, and upfront from the beginning is too difficult.
Hi, actual farmer here.  You couldn't be more wrong.  You are clearly misinformed on the topic, please quit posting like you know what you are doing. 
No food we eat is naturally grown.  Go eat natural wheat, or corn, or bananas.  They are inedible.  Just because you're afraid doesn't mean the world should starve.
  

> Yeah, except the vast amounts of glyphosate you are contractually bound to use if you grow for Monsanto

[Myth](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/02/10/im-a-farmer-and-i-signed-a-contract-with-monsanto/). Monsanto doesn't even own the rights to glyphosate. Many other companies produce it as well. Did you even read the Wikipedia article on glyphosate before you make these claims?

Are these farmers contractually bound to use glyphosate on crops that aren't even intended for its use? I'd love to see your source on this.

You act like GMOs are so terrible for farmers, yet they choose GM crops overwhelmingly whenever the option is available.

>Oh, that, and threatening the entire supply of an incredible variety of naturally growing food in the world.

How exactly? Producing foods that yield more while requiring less pesticide, fuel, oil, and tilling threatens the food supply?

>No biggie.

A [meta-analysis of 147 studies](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629) found that on average GMOs increase yields by 22%, reduce pesticide use by 37% and increase farmer profits by 68% and more in developing countries. I think it's a biggie.


You have to rebuy gmo plants every year so they can continue to do r&d on other plants in the meantime. Even public research labs do this, not just Monsanto. It can take years to develop something. For example there is a fungus currently obliterating California citrus that they've been trying to find a solution to and invest millions into.  Its hard to do if you gi bankrupt. If it wasn't worth it for these farmers to re buy every year then they just wouldn't. The problem is that farmers get greedy and try to make clones in their garage in the off months and end up with a gmo crop in their field that they didn't buy.  That's where all those lawsuits cone from.  And the fact that you think we eat an incredible variety of naturally growing food tells me your understanding of agriculture is next to zero.  We eat next to nothing that you can find in the wild and almost everything was man made.  Did you know the banana was invented around the same time as ww1... you had to boil them before that.
Except labeling costs companies a bunch of money, for no benefit except as a subsidy to the organic farming lobby.  You're all getting played worse than people who don't believe in climate change and point to the one scientist wearing a suit with a BP logo.
[deleted]
It's unfortunate too because the industry SHOULD be resisting superfluous labelling requirements. GMO labelling offers a marginal increase in consumer choice while providing no guidance on how to make that choice. People are going to see the label, consider the unscientific anti-GMO propaganda they've heard, and assume that "because they label it we should avoid it." Meanwhile, anyone with a developed sense of risk assessment who has done their research from credible sources knows that genetic modification is not something to be afraid of and won't be paying attention to these labels anyway.

It's such an underhanded way to manipulate consumers and play off of their fears, but if the industry tries to stop it then they're looked at with suspicion as if they have something to hide. 
If special interest groups demanded labeling of "crops harvested on Sunday" and the industry resisted, would it "give off the impression that there's something to hide"?
It's so good for you, you shouldn't even be *allowed* to know what's in it!

Astroturfer "logic".
Force labeling when there's 0 valid reason to gives off the impression there's something potentially wrong with GMO, and the scientific consensus says there isn't. 
Monsanto makes organic seed, silly. 

They can still profit just like General Mills can. 

You want to be an idiot, they'll both market to you. 
[deleted]
Because gmo has genetic in it and that is scary.
Yeah not even close. Selective breeding is NOT genetic modification.  Selecting only to replant seeds from the biggest strawberries is not the same as splicing genes in a lab setting.

Genetic modification is used much less than you think.  It's just the crops that are modified are so widely used that they're everywhere.  Corn is the most abundant GMO since it's literally used *everywhere*, in and out of the food chain.  Soybeans are all selectively bred with only the roundup ready transgenic modification done.
Shots fired
What does Agent Orange, a defoliant the US government dumped on Vietnam, have to do with GMOs?

>for no benefit except as a subsidy to the organic farming lobby.

There it is again.  Why are you shitting on GMO?

How can hoding information be seen as anything other than negative?  I can't remember if it was meat or veggies, but US producers wanted country of origin labeling.  Then they got pissed because some country built that into a positive where stores or restaurants would promote that countries products.

Do you see a lot of organic products that *aren't* labeled organic?  If you feel the need to hide information about your product, how sjould people percieve that?  And why bring up global warming or anti vax?  

Put the tinfoil hat away and try to think reasonably.
Cyanide and arsenic have documented adverse health effects. The process of genetic modification does not have any documented adverse health effects.

So your analogy is terrible.
All ingredients are already listed. Genetic engineering is a breeding technique and not an ingredient.
>add cyanide and arsenic and not have to label it as such.

Why would a food processing company want to poison and kill their own customers? 

The thing is, anti-GMO ideology has already made its way onto store shelves, with "non-GMO certified" labels being put on foods by companies that can afford to. That already casts suspicion upon all unlabeled foods, especially when the anti-GMO foods contain marketing copy about how healthy and wholesome they are, and when faceless corporations oppose labeling. But labeling all GMOs will illuminate this darkness in which natural foodists set their horror stories. [Even Monsanto supports national labeling of GMO foods](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/03/22/monsanto-supports-a-national-gmo-labeling-standard/) for this reason.
One reason I'm for labelling is that currently, corn products are not labelled. I'm allergic to corn and corn-derived ingredients, which are nearly always from GMO corn. Labelling GMO ingredients means labelling corn, which is currently hidden in our food supply under a myriad of names. 
My point was solely about strategy. They're acknowledging the market as it is, and not as they wish it would be. And in the long run, I predict that this will be good for these companies anyways, as it will eventually normalize GMOs in the eyes of consumers.
>Monsanto makes organic seed, silly.

>They can still profit just like General Mills can.

>You want to be an idiot, they'll both market to you.    


Not sure what any of that means in regard to labels being on the way. Are you some kind of organic fan?

  
The laws that have been suggested so far require lots of testing with strict enforcement and fines.
> We barely have testing and enforcement of lead in the water

I didn't know it was law to make sure lead was in drinking water. 
/u/plants_noob not understand....make GMO bad thing even though feed more people with less resources.
It's not just selective breeding.  There's also a lot of hybridizing of various species, sometimes with genetically unstable results.  There's also backcrossing where you pair a hybrid back with one of the original species, often to get gene knockouts (disabling of genes to understand their effects).  
Yes... yes it is.  You're modifying the genetics. That's what I'm saying is they should call it transgenic modification rather than genetic modification. 
Pretty much, when people say GMOs, people think Monsanto > Agent Orange. 
Basically Monsanto fucked their branding and every other GMO company's branding until about 20 years from now.  
This has nothing to do with the actual science. I am just describing the word association and branding. Monsanto really fucked themselves good in that regard. And haven't done a banner job making themselves look good since.
> Do you see a lot of organic products that aren't labeled organic?

Then why do you need a GMO label?
Because they aren't hiding information.  GMO doesn't mean anything!  There is no difference between a "GMO" and a fucking banana, or a cow, or wheat.  Do you have any idea what real fucking wheat looks like before people genetically modified it?!!?!  Should we put labels on Dalmations labeling that they are genetically modified?!  You don't even know what you are upset about!
>The thing is, anti-GMO ideology has already made its way onto store shelves.

The non-GMOs will probably end up like the "organic" labeled products, where upper-class health-conscious consumers will pay premium prices thinking they're better for you.
How will it tell you if there's corn in it?
> Not sure what any of that means

That's all you should be typing with regards to this subject. 

BTW, you're easily blinded by BS if you think that article you linked to me was written by anyone other than a quack. 

It's written by yet another charlatan who makes their living selling diet and health bullshit. 

But you know what the fuck they mean
OK I'll rephrase.  To people who are actually educated and work in the agriculture research and development field, genetic modification and selective breeding is not the same thing at all.
I point that out because everyone seems to think labeling is negative.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it:)

I'm not upset, i'm just making a valid point.  To say there is nothing to seperate GMO from conventional breeding is quite a poor argument.  Where did the designation GMO come from, eh?  Obviously, there is a way to transfer genetic material that any troglodyte can perform in their back yard, and now scientists have developed new, novel methods of doing so that can't be performed without lab equipment.  Yes, we all know that humans made a chihuahua from wolves, but of course we didn't invent the term GMO to describe that result.  It was accomplished long before we had to invent the term GMO to describe the results of new methods of transferring genetic material.  A lot of consumers think there is a difference.  Just like monsanto has different boundaries for growing seedcorn near sweetcorn or hard yellow corn.  Is there a difference in the resulting contamination?  Nope.  It's just consumer preference, but monsanto bows to it, exactly like organic growers.  You are making a mountain out of a molehill.

> There is no difference between a "GMO" and a fucking banana

See, right there you just mentioned a great reason for labeling.  How am i supposed to know whether to eat the banana or use it for lovemaking?
If GMO corn is labeled, and nearly all corn is GMO, corn would then be labeled, in a way. It would be easier to reject a product based on a GMO labelling than to scrutinize the ingredients for hidden corn derivatives. 
Yes labels are on the way. Good day for us!
The goal of selectively breeding is to genetically modify that outcome plant.
Well it is when you consider it a pointless cost. You'd get better information by getting them to list what pesticide(s) were used on it. You also see how customers flocked away from GMO in Europe when products had to be labeled, so there is good reason to not want to just label everything GMO.
But the proposed label is "Contains GMO". Not "Contains GMO corn".
That's no less ignorant than cheering on anti vaccine nonsense. 

[YIKES!](https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/4bju7v/well_umthefirst_of_all_umgravity_is_the_loading/) Color me not surprised to find out you're just  leaking  out of some of Reddit's most extreme subsites. 

Not wasting another second on you.  

If consumers don't want gmo, isn't that more reason for them to know?  Is this some nanny state where we are just going to tell people what's good for them?  

In the end, these are consumer products.  If consumers want the info, they shpuld be able to have it.  There are all kinds of stupid things dictated by consumers.  Why does medicine taste like medicine?  It doesn't need to, but consumers think it works better if it tastes kind of bad.  Fighting labeling is ridiculous.  If gmo's have a consumer perception problem, the producers can handle that the same way everyone else does: PR and advertising.  Limiting available info about products is just bad practice, and doesn't do much for perception.
Good! The personal attacks are so low brow. See ya!
>Limiting available info about products

What info though? There are already non-GMO and organic labels so labeling the rest is pointless. Consumers *already have* the information necessary to not eat GMO, so this is asinine. If the labels provided any useful information whatsoever it wouldn't be as much of an issue but people keep droning on about "information" when this label gives you nothing useful about the product. Just because the public wants something doesn't mean they deserve it or are entitled to it, and it sure as hell doesn't make it a good idea.
OK, I'll answer that one troll. 

You like to hang in r/conspiracy, which is now an echo chamber due to their heavy censorship. 

It's not like that here, so I'm sure you're not  used to having nonsense you've fallen for challenged. 

You'll do what most people like you do, and that's just hang where no one in their right minds would, and there's moderators to censor dissent and help you all think you're among the enlightened. 
>Just because the public wants something doesn't mean they deserve it or are entitled to it,

Yes of course, but it's hard to argue that to consumers without sounding condescending.  "You don't need that info, so you can't have it".  

It just seems like a dumb argument and not a really important thing to deny consumers.  They aren't famous for being rational.
So, yeah, labels are the topic and you'll be seeing them on all the GMO products. 
Maybe they should shut off the Grocery Store Shrink Ray??
Maybe if the cereal wasn't so expensive.
Tomorrow's headline: New research suggests breakfast more important than previously thought.
A box of cereal is about $4 these days. For that same price you can by 18 eggs and ~8 pieces of sausage. 3 eggs and a piece of sausage is a much healthier breakfast than any cereal out there besides Frosted Meaty-Os.
Milk and cereal costs way too much today. Add a full size family and it costs a fortune to feed your kids every morning. I'm not surprised at all people are starting to think outside the box for breakfast. 

Despite the rising stock market, the economy still sucks. 25% of the remaining workforce (actual unemployment via U-6 and those permanently out of the workforce=20%) make $10/hr. or less and 41% of the remaining workforce makes 21k/yr. or less. Basically, 60% of the workforce is on subsistence wages.
Why in the fuck would I pay $6 for a box of sugar and corn. Fuck off Kellogg('s)
Cereal is too fucking expensive.

the cost of LIVING is too fucking expensive.
I think a huge part of the problem is that Kellogg's manufactures and markets mostly junk food for breakfast. Almost every single cereal on the market, Kellogg's or otherwise, has little nutritional value. Froot Loops, Raisin Bran, Frosted Flakes, etc. are all total garbage. Processed carbs and sugar. 
Maybe everyone is as tired as I am in the morning and just zombies to work.... I'm not hungry until like 11am-ish.
Not surprising. People are poor, how does any business think they will stay open when no one is able to afford their products?
Gluten makes your dick fly off like a rocket. I saw it in a video.
That's an awesome sign that maybe Americans are waking up to realize that a bowl of sugar is not a healthy way to start the day or feed your kids. This company has assisted far more people in killing themselves than any cigarette company, and sugar kills more Americans every year than all illegal drugs combined. If heroin had a powerful political lobbying force to buy politicians like Kelloggs, they still couldn't crush lives and kill people at the staggering rate sugar filled foods do.

They just need to strike a deal with the prison industry. Mandated Frootloop breakfasts.
I'd buy a lot more cereal if it weren't 5 dollars a box.
Steel cut oats from the bulk section: cheaper and healthier.

Cook up a big batch, stash in the fridge, 90 seconds of nuking to a hot breakfast with whatever toppings you want that day: some fresh or dried fruit, some nuts for protein, so much better for you!
As a daily cereal eater, I don't buy Kellogg's cereal because it's hilariously overpriced all the time. I started buying Malt-O-Meal bags of cereal and never looked back. I can get a 36 ounce bag of cereal for about $5. and it lasts me a couple weeks The only time I even buy famous name brand cereal anymore is if Quaker Cinnamon Life 20 Ounce boxes are on sale for 2 for $5ish, which is pretty often.
Boo-fucking-hoo you corporate monster. 31% drops in your profits means to me 31% of your former customers who have decided to eat healthier for now on. Hooray for America!
Another reason for the drop could be all the cutting to the supplemental health programs.  Food stamps really subsidizes the cereal industry.  Hell the people I have known who used the program had more cereal then they knew what to do with.
I would LOVE to buy cereal for the mornings, but its honestly wayyyyy to expensive for the little bit you get. Pulse milk is going up and I prefer to use that for cooking.
More and more people are realizing how much sugar goes into Kellogg's breakfast foods and snacks. Low calorie doesn't equal low every thing else. It's just a cover up, and when body image is such a prominent topic in today's world, Kellogg's is being exposed. Why pay such a high price for a product that's low calorie when you can pay less for a product that's high in nutrients?
They just need to bring back wacky racing. Problem solved!
A banana, some peanut butter, raw oatmeal, and milk.

Throw that chit in a blender and drink it on the way to work.  Cheap and healthy.
Sugar, sugar, sugar....ever wonder where all the diabetes is coming from?  Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time....what could go wrong.  I eat what I like.  
Five bucks for a two ounce box of cereal has finally caught up with them.
K should reduce the sugar amount in their breakfast products! They'll save money and won't "poison" their so nice customers...
Maybe because all their shit is useless carbs.
You'd be healthier eating the box rather than the cereal
You are just paying for them to advertise to you. This is why their cereal is so expensive. It's all a marketing scam.

"Off brand" cereal is probably made in the same facilities as Kellogg brand cereals are. 
I guess people have reduced the amount they masturbate.
ITT: Young Americans who have no idea how *insanely cheap* food is for them.
The number of cereal killers in the US is skyrocketing.  
Maybe Kellogg's should make healthier products, or at least price them the same. Whenever I see Kellogg's crap on sale it is always Fruit Loops/Corn Pops/Frosted Flakes or Pop Tarts and cookies...rarely Special K or Crispix, or Corn Flakes, or their other lower-sugar brands.  I rarely buy Kellogg's cereal just because it is basically nothing but a bag of sugar. 
At least when I buy Quaker products, i get some granola and oats with my sugar.

One thing about breakfast cereals is that you can see their accounting departments in action.  They calculate each meal and how much for each meal and price their cereal box accordingly.  The problem is that the price is far too high, far to high.
Stopped eating/buying Kellogg's when they dropped Michael Phelps for tokein'. Considering what the founder of Kellogg's was into and did to people, they can fuck off.
This is super cereal!
[deleted]
Its not just that its expensive, many are so loaded with sugar that they're unhealthy.  I'd much rather make some oatmeal or some pancakes from scratch and sweeten em up with a bit of maple syrup and fruit.  Much healthier, cheaper, and only takes little more effort and time to prepare.

But yeah, it was initially the costs and budgetary stresses that led me to give up on cereal and most prepackaged foods a few years ago. I feel like there is a large group of people who have no idea how to cook beyond using a microwave or reheating something in the oven though :-(
Cheerios are around $5 a box...$5 for toasted oats.
Advertising is expensive.
Cereal is ridiculously expensive, incredibly deceptive in its box sizes, appearances, and volume, and constantly shrinking. Boxes are getting thinner, with even less of the volume taken up. Look at how crazy they are getting with the weights. 11.32oz, 14.4, all weird fractional numbers. Also store brand cereals are about 50% less in price and generally have standardized box sizes. If not for the price per oz, which is a tiny tiny number, it would be very hard to do any comparison.
Seriously $5 for a small box.  Eggs and toast are way more filling and cheaper
Let me hop over to the bank for a loan to buy a box or two.....
And maybe if it wasn't crap you shouldn't eat or pay money for.  Try this: Quaker quick oats with milk - Heat for a few mins and add some butter and a little honey.  Congrats. A healthy and delicious warm breakfast that will keep you full longer and not give you diabetes.  
And they went back to the days when corn flakes didn't taste like cardboard 
It really isn't though.  It works out to all of less than $0.50 per meal when bought in bulk from even places like Walmart.

The reality is people aren't cereal eaters anymore.  They'd rather have egg McMuffins and the like...
And maybe if the plastic bags inside them didn't rip so easily.

I used to have cereal two or three times a week for breakfast, until I opened a new box, and pulled too hard when opening the bag within (it ripped open 1/3 of the way down). It made it very awkward to pour cereal out of it, and to close the bag properly, so I just didn't feel like having cereal more then once every two weeks simply because I didn't want to deal with the ripped bag.

At first I thought "I must have pulled too hard, I'll be more careful next time". But then next time came, and despite being careful and not pulling too hard the exact same thing happened. I'm not even that strong. They make the bags so thin to save a few cents that they rip way too easily now.
Not scary enough: New research shows that a diet that does not include cereal at breakfast can lead to significant increases of all cancers.
Plus that doesn't include the milk to go along with that overpriced box of empty carbs.
The reason people eat cereal has more to do with time then it does money. It takes longer to fry up some eggs and sausage then it does to fill up a bowl full of cereal. Most people are already rushing around in the morning trying to get to work on time especially if they have kids they need to herd off to school or a long commute to work.
Good point. 

ps I had to google 'Frosted Meaty-Os" to make sure they weren't a thing. 
Yup, wages have only gone up for the extremely wealthy. Everybody else faces higher prices and with the same amount of money from a decade ago. Plus, aid like food stamps has been reduced and student loan debt is skyrocketing.
I agree.... You can't polish a turd, even if you freeze it first, paint it a different color, decorate it with glitter, and call it something else. 

That pretty much explains the US economy right now. 
Uh... That's a really cool story and you should definitely publish it on your blog but wtf does it have to do with this article?
Because it is the safest the most natural way to stop people from masturbating.
Because you don't want to wait for the weeks when that same box will cost $2-3 on sale. Pay attention to supermarket flyers and use coupons.
[The rent is too high!](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-09/harvard-study-finds-the-rent-is-too-damn-high) (for reals)
Sadly they market that shit as healthy and society is still brainwashed to believe it to be healthy. You'll see things like "Great source of Vitamin D" or "No saturated fat" or "High source of fiber" really big on the box. Fact of the matter is that shit doesn't matter at all. 

You know how cereals like Total get all those vitamins? They fucking grind up multivitamins into the cereal itself during processing. Would eating a spoonful of sugar following by a one a day vitamin be healthy? That's essentially what you do with cereal. 

If you walked around any place in the US and showed people a picture of bacon and eggs, and a picture of frosted flakes / a glass of OJ / two pieces of toast and asked which is the healthiest breakfast I guarantee you most people would point to the frosted flakes. 
Yea no kidding. And what always gets me is how they still make it taste so bad. It has less nutritional value than a cake, couldn't they at least make it taste good?
Hey me too! Everyone says I have a problem.

"It's cereal, so it's healthy!"

It's literally a bowl of cookies.
> That's an awesome sign that maybe Americans are waking up to realize that a bowl of sugar is not a healthy way to start the day or feed your kids.

Millennials are light years ahead of my generation with respect to nutritional understanding.  So at least you got that going for you.....
Even "healthier" options like bagels and orange juice aren't healthy options -- they're mostly sugar as well.  :(  
  

I find cereal to be a pretty good lower calorie start to the day.  Of course I don't go for the crazy sugar ones, but I think 200 cal for something that's going to hold off hunger until lunch is a pretty good deal. Plus it's basically the only time I drink milk anymore.
Oh please, get a grip.
No people have stop buying cereal because it has gotten so expensive you can make a better breakfast for around the same price.
What if you add corn meal to the sugar?
Stop buying it when it's not on sale.
Malt-o-meal is way cheaper and just as good.
you can also cook it in the crocpot overnight.
I doubt very much whatever this 31% drop is that it's "former customers who have decided to eat healthier"

In the thread we seem to have 3 examples : (A) people buying cheaper off-brand (so no more or less healthy) (B) People too lazy to get up and eat (definitely not healthy) and (C) people who eat some kind of cooked thing - eggs (not so bad these days, maligned in the past though) or processed meats like sausages and bacon (supposedly increase the risks of colon cancer)

So, not exactly health conscious.

Not the least because it's clear no one really know what 'eating healthier'  actually is. It's just buffoons running from and to whatever the latest food craze is. "low fat" used to be the thing. At the moment in the USA it's "sugar is toxic" "carbs are evil"
Yogurt and raw oatmeal with some cinnamon and honey/fruit preserves is delicious

yogurt + ground flaxseed is another good combination
Yeah, but then it's still just empty carbs for breakfast. Got to have some protein if you don't want to be hungry again in an hour.
Or at least put real sugar in it.  
*"Kelloggs don't make masturbation prevention foodstuffs for any other company"*
Kellogg's has a "natural" brand kashi, they bought and started filling with all the same crap. I believe their slogan is: "The FDA has chosen not to regulate the term 'natural'"
you eat a box of cereal in one night? 


Why not just wake up earlier?
Dude, it's all about the store-brand bag. I bet 25% of what you're paying for is literally the box.
+5 bucks for the cereal alone, another 5 for milk

Fuck that, I can buy eggs, bacon and fruit for that kinda cash
It's still only 5 bucks which gives you at least 3 meals. It's what I eat when I'm trying to reduce my food spending.
Too pricey, They should be about $3
Bingo. Aldis is 2-3 bucks for a box of cereal.
Less demand should cause the price to drop, but it still goes up
Scissors bro.
Especially Ebola. Do you want the terrorists to win? Think of the children, buy Kellogs cereal.

Kellogg is kind of a weirdo anyways. Corn Flakes were the least expensive feed that mental patients would actually eat, and graham crackers were supposed to keep people from jerking off. Kellogg's food strategy is more akin to that of feeding cattle. 

Source: Am retarded and can't stop masturbating. 
Yes but as Kellogs 31% drop in profit proves that consumers are deciding  the time saved is no longer worth the price
Yes but not by much. You can fry two eggs, make toast, and brew coffee in 5 minutes. Literally, 300 seconds from a cold pan. You just need to get your system down.
Absolutely correct.
I see it every day. At least a half dozen people now walking to work because they can't afford a car on part time minimum wage pay.
[you can polish a turd actually](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/polishing-a-turd-minimyth.htm)

On a cost per pound basis breakfast cereals are expensive. With less people working and or working for less money, they have less disposable income to spend on things like boxed cereal. A large drop in sales in that sector is telling.
Corn Flakes, FTW.
you forgot the cholesterol lowering cheerios 
or how about we just eat cake for breakfast? 


gonna have to disagree with you on this one, cookie crisps, frosted flakes, and fruit loops all taste like heaven to me
I just need a coffee. Then once I'm actually awake I am good for some real food. I also eat something every night around 8ish.
Bacon and Egg's.

People just don't want to cook in the morning and they go with the faster option.

Start your day with proteins and small amounts of healthy fats, like avocado. Our bodies have been trained to fuel themselves with sugar through nutritional indoctrination. Theses companies actually designed the old food pyramid (through political lobbying) with the intention of getting kids addicted to sugar and grain  so they could be life long (short lives with diabetes) customers. You can train your body to use fat as fuel instead of sugar and your body will actually start eating your love handles to fuel you. Sugar is the absolute worst thing to eat first thing in the morning. You do need carbs, but use them sparingly in the afternoon as recovery for energy you burnt, not fuel for later. And absolutely zero carbs 2-3 hours before bed. 
Bagels are just bread, most of them are under 400 calories and have 5-20G of sugar. That's not exactly bad for you. 
[deleted]
I don't. I buy them when they're a dollar or two. I suspect most people are doing the same.
The bags. The giant bags of cereal. The best.
Absolutely love yogurt.  I try to incorporate it as much as possible.  Need to give flaxseed a try.  The wife has been buying chia seeds for the past year.

I'm assuming you maintain a solid fitness/workout regimen?
Yes! The only way I finally cut out my 10:30 snack was my switching from cereal to non fat yogurt mixed with strawberry's and granola with a hard boiled egg on the side. 
Like that's gonna happen.
Sleep is important to your health.

Even the store brands are closing the gap on the pricing. Cereal is fucking outrageous 
Oh, that box. That fucking box. $4-$5 for a box of cereal, and it's still not made for kids to open yet without shredding the goddamn thing.

thats because capitalism is a myth and for poor people

A lot of those people are probably turning to even faster to prepare foods in the morning like yogurt or granola bars which is what I eat in the morning along with an apple although I'm sure that is better for you then sugary cereals.
to be fair, they probably couldn't afford to drive to work 10 years ago on part-time work with minimum wage pay either. Gas was expensive in 2004.
My favorite anti-masturbation breakfast cereal.  Mmmm...wholesome.
[Bill Cosby agrees.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuamlBQ2aW4)
Hard boil some eggs and cook some bacon twice a week and put it in the fridge.  Take it out in the morning for quick breakfast.
*Eggs.  
  
And you're right.  People don't want to cook - it takes time in the morning and people would rather sleep since they're probably already not getting enough of that.  I just grab a protein drink and call it good.
I can't start my day without picking up the eggs from my backyard chickens and frying them up. It just doesn't feel right.
all you people are making me feel bad about my breakfast which consists of:

cold version of dinner last night and coffee.
wait, what is wrong with orange juice now?
This sounds really bro-science-y.

You don't lose your love handles by eating more fat than carbs.  You lose your love handles by maintaining a net caloric deficit.

But I'm with you that fat gets a bad rap for no good reason.  And studies have shown a low-calorie high-fat diet to be nominally better for weight loss than a low-calorie, high-carb diet.
> Our bodies have been trained to fuel themselves with sugar through nutritional indoctrination

FFS, stop talking nonsense.
Why would sugar be worse for you in the morning than in the evening?
They may not have a lot of added sugar, but they're still mostly carbs.  They're not particularly nutritious. 
It is EXACTLY the same thing.  Check out the sugar content. It generally will be about the same ~30 grams of sugar.   It is all engineered to trigger a neurological pleasure response  in your brain.   Check out the labels on yougurts too.  Same thing. 
I know. That's why I started going to bed earlier. It's made my whole day better.
Really everything costs more. While corporations adjust for inflation with their prices (in same cases they test to see how much people will actually pay, no doubt), wages have been stagnant, making everything costly as shit. 

It's why I get pissed off every time I read a report in some magazine that says there's growth in the economy. It's a shithole, man. I see people in poverty everywhere I go and it's not like they're not trying. I know people who just spend 90% of their days shuffling finances and saying, "Man, I hope I can pay the bills this month."

In some parts of the country, they haven't seen economic growth since the early 2000s.
Food prices never go down. It's a well-known phenomena.
Fair enough. I don't know where you live or shop, but the rare times that I buy breakfast cereal, I get it from Aldi. All knockoff brands and they range from $2 - $3.50 for sugary junk to granola-like healthy stuff respectively. If you live near an Aldi, I recommend shopping there for all the basics. So much cheaper than other places.
Dude, if there's an Aldi near you, check it out. It will forever change your grocery shopping. I haven't bought cereal in a long time, but from some internet searching, [people we're paying around $1.50 for a box of knock-off cereal at Aldi as recently as 2013.](http://aldimom.com/aldi-review-aldi-cereal-millville/)

We actually fixed the hi-jinks bug a while back.  We just can't effectively code against tomfoolery...
Yeah, I totally only eat cereal for dinner. Of course, I like to end my day with sugary goodness instead of beginning it that way.
Good point, but inflation wasn't as bad.
I make breakfast bowls on Sunday from time to time.  I use bacon as the bowl and put egg and other misc stuff into it and keep them in the fridge.

I just don't' do this all the time.
Yea, I was upset when my instant hot water tap stopped working.  I use to just make a bowl of oatmeal in a couple seconds.

Now, I don't like waiting around a couple minutes for water to warm up and just drink some milk and eat something quicker.
Well the main problem is that about 99% of the orange juice you will find is processed with more sugar added.  If you squeeze oranges to make your orange juice... whole different story. 
[deleted]
It's just sugar. 
True that calories matter, but when you eat a diet high in fat, moderate in protein and low in carb you feel satiated much easier than you do when you eat high carb / low fat. 

I used to eat a bowl of oatmeal washed down by a glass of OJ around 7:00 in the morning and I'd be starving by 9:30am. Now I eat two sausage patties washed down by a glass of water at the same time and I'm not hungry at all until lunch. Both have roughly the same amount of calories. 

There are multiple legit ways to lose weight, but low-carb seems to be the easiest for me. I'm never hungry, I eat amazing food, I don't calorie count at all (I eat when I'm hungry and I eat until I'm full) yet the weight has literally melted off and continues to do so. It's like a fucking cheat code to dieting. 

Though I admit, I miss beer. 
I've gone from 221 to 177 eating a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. 
Carbs aren't unhealthy. I've lost 170+lbs over the last two years by counting calories. I still eat plenty of carbs. 

It's less than 400 calories of food. It's seriously not enough to be any sort of an issue. 
The media lies to make us feel a false sense of security. They say the economy is alright but when most people make less than $24k a year and can't afford a basic standard of living it's not ok. Oh but the millionaires are doing better so I guess it's alright. 
So your observations of the people you know are representative of the entire US economy?
> wages have been stagnant  
  
I would wager that this is true more for people without marketable skills than those with them. Whose fault that is depends on each person, but that doesn't change the fact that companies don't value people who don't help them profit. No company pays people out of charity - they pay people to help the company make money.
We're moving towards a state where almost everyone has to shop at Aldi's or similar low income stores to survive.  What happens after people shift to cheaper stores/brands and still can't make ends meet?  How many steps must we fall before we lose our first world status?  Why should we be okay with a state that's incredibly more productive, but less prosperous than what we've had in the past? 

The system is broken, and every day laws are created, repealed, or ignored to make it even more corrupt.  Faceless, unaccountable corporate greed is running our society into the ground.  How much must the wealth gap increase before we are forced into violent revolution?  I'd prefer the change be peaceful, but we are running out of time to fix it.  A starving man is not one easily reasoned with.
It's been my experience that the food I get at Aldi's is as good as and in some cases better, than the equivalent product at Kroger. Aldi's is the only place I can buy American Pasturized Process Cheese, which, while processed is still real cheese. Everyone else sells American Pasturized Process Cheese Food. A product that stretches the definition of food. I like Aldi's a lot.

[You might want to pick up a Montana brochure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS0nhz1RHEw&t=6m58s)
I make almost all of my hot cereals in the microwave. I put it in, turn it on about power level 7 or 8, go take a shower and get dressed, then come back in 5-15 minutes to a piping hot bowl of cream of what, wheatena, oatmeal or grits.  Sweet delicious synergy. 
One thing that I've found that is helpful is to keep fruit on hand...  It's super easy to grab an apple or a banana as I'm heading out the door.
I buy the 100% stuff.
OK that is a good point. Got to admit OJ is very easy. A bottle lasts over a week in the fridge, easy to clean after that, low cost, doesn't take up much room.

Real oranges are messy, space consuming and time intensive.

Maybe I should switch to tomato juice?
umm but it is fructose right? Also, it has vitamin C, D and potassium
Yep.  Over the years I have cut out completely from my diet sodas, fruit juices, breads, cereals, rice, milk, and most potatoes.   Still couldnt lose weight.   The one thing I did not cut out though was alcohol.  I love wine.   

As soon as I stopped drinking... started dropping weight.  Almost no exercicse.  Lost about an inch around my waist in 3 weeks just by stopping drinking.  My diet was otherwise good but without stopping drinking  it didnt matter.   For all the carbs I cut out of my diet I was replacing them all with wine.  I exercise very little too and still lost weight. 

 Its alll about diet. 
I feel ya.

I count calories, personally.  But like you, my preference is high fat / high protein.   I try to keep it clean though - the less processed the food, the better.  So for fat I eat eggs, all kinds of nuts, beans, whole dairy (as opposed to 2%, 1%, or skim), avocados, red meat, ect.

But I do tend to have high carb breakfasts... it's always fruit, though, never sugary cereal.  So many calories, and it's not even that good.

Also I can't just quit beer altogether.  I don't drink it much, but every fall blue moon comes out with a pumpkin harvest ale that I just can't say no to.
Guess who the billionaires who own the media allow to read the news to us?  Millionaires.  Millionaires with perfect teeth and hair.
No. The hard working people in **some parts of the country**, as I iterated before. If you want to dismiss the truth of the matter, do it. I don't care. It's naysayers like you that are dragging our economy through the mud, refusing to acknowledge the people suffering.
When I was a kid, my parents always said, "Carl, someone has to flip those burgers and file all that menial paperwork. It's just how life is."

In short, someone has to do all the arbitrary shit that I don't want to do. In some places in the U.S. those unmarketable skills are 80% or more of the jobs available. In parts of Kentucky, that's all I saw. Warehouse gigs, lawnmowing, painting/roofing houses, flipping burgers, and so on were all that was available. Hell, most businesses were doing so poorly in rural areas because of their property tax, business taxes, and general upkeep costs that they couldn't afford to hire people or they were going out of business completely. Most were replaced by a McDonalds or a Taco Bell.

Walmart was at full capacity at all times with no jobs available. So was Target. The mall had a job opening once every 4-5 months, and even seasonal positions went quickly.

Unless you only paid about $200 in rent and had no other obligations, you lived paycheck to paycheck and lived in really poor conditions. I saw it every day and those people just didn't get the opportunities that others did.

Not sure why you're being down voted. Reddit really likes their free lunch. 
Well, I didn't try to make this political, but here we go. I make over $60k a year. I shop at Aldi because I'm frugal, not because I am forced to. Flour there is the same as flour at Kroger, but it's half the price.  

I see people every week with shopping carts full of soda, frozen foods and junk food. I don't believe the problem is people not having enough money, but rather not being educated enough to understand how their actions adversely affect them. Or they might know that it's bad but they are lazy, or simply never knew how to cook so all they can do is microwave hot pockets. By saying "woah's me - the American people are so oppressed" you are insulting every single one of our ability to make good decisions for ourselves. Are there hurdles? yes. Are some of them corrupt, unfair, or even illegal? yes. But whining about it has never and will never change that. Do right for yourself and help educate people who are less fortunate than yourself and we all will be able to get away from overpaying for things which in turn keeps people in poverty. Advertising preys on the uneducated and education is the only way to fight that.
I wouldn't blame corporations too much. They have to do a lot of the things they do to remain competitive. I'd blame the banks, and the regulators behind them. 
Fuck that - full blast for a minute thirty then burn your mouth.
> orange juice aren't healthy options -- they're mostly sugar as well. :(

What??? You do realize fruits are mostly sugar too, that's kind of why they're sweet and taste good. Or were you talking about like an orange drink? Also an apple or a banana is next to nothing for some people. Thinking of myself here, i can eat apples till i'm sick and never get "full", and banana's are little more than 2 or 3 bites of unfullfilling sweet paste.
Is it from concentrate?  If it is it likely has added sugar.  Read the label. If sugar is labeled seperately there... it has been added.  If it is fresh squeezed unadulterated juice it will probably just say oranges or orange juice under ingredients. 
Of course people are suffering.  People have always been suffering.  I'm not sure where you got that I was "refusing to acknowledge" that.  

But why exactly are you pissed off when you see a magazine making the factual statement that there's growth in the economy?


The GOP needs to understand that the labor market has changed and it is no longer true that "anyone can make it as long as they try hard enough."  The days of Mom and Pop stores and service businesses has given way to corporate operations and information technologies that pass by the blue collar workers.  Something needs to change.  

The solution isn't one of the abstract/idealist/sophomoric/pseudo-intellectual social justice "isms" or "universal salaries without work" schemes because these do more harm than good.  But there does need to be action to ensure that everyone regains the opportunity to achieve middle class status.  Otherwise, the "ism" advocates will prevail.  
> those people just didn't get the opportunities that others did.

I know the "some people have it worse so your problem isn't as bad" way to debate doesn't solve anything, but I just want to point out that there are people who I lived with in Niger, West Africa who literally had 1 set of clothes and lived in mud huts with straw roofs. These are kids who sit on rocks for school chairs, and have to share 1 pen for 5 students. This is a country that continues to be ranked behind Afghanistan by the UN in terms of Human Development Index. Some of these people have found ways to get scholarships to the US and gone on to lead successful lives here, marrying and prospering in America. I'm just saying that not getting the opportunities that others did isn't a valid excuse. It means you have to work twice, even ten times as hard to succeed, but it also means you have to have the will to do it yourself. Not all people, but too many people want all the glory without any of the effort.
It's easier to click the "dislike" button rather than have a grown up discussion about it and try to find solutions to hungry kids and skill-less adults.
*woe is me
They complain because they're looking for another politician to elect that will solve all their problems. 
Not that it's realistic, but with the internet, specifically twitter or any other social media, the US public could simply boycott corporations who do shady business. However it seems that people either don't care, don't want to make sacrifices (so ironic when people don't want to "sacrifice" giving up some first world luxury that was likely made by someone in sweatshop-like conditions for menial pay), or are just too distracted with the VMAs to make a difference. That said, I hope everyone votes. I did yesterday.
The problem with the full-blast method is that your cereal doesn't cook as thoroughly as if you would have used the stove, except for the packets that are designed to be cooked in the microwave since they're already par-cooked.
it says orange juice only.
Well then you are probably good. 
I don't get why this is racist.  The brown Pop is the only one with a job.  Seems racially empowering to me.
Really... who is so sensitive that their day is ruined by a cereal box? 
[deleted]
It's obvious to me that the Corn Pops box depicts a mall in Japan. All the Corn Pops are yellow and there's a ninja store. Due to the aging population, the brown Corn Pop is a Filipino on a work visa.

Yes you read that right, depicting a brown corn pop on a cereal box is teaching kids racism now I guess
Can see the point but really the reaction is a bigger put-down of cleaning staff. It’s respectable, necessary, honest work.
So that black janitor is not allowed to be on the cereal package anymore, BECAUSE OF HIS COLOR?

That will teach the kids!
Oh this is rich. The corn pop looks happy, he's got a job, maybe it's his dream job? Fuck off Saladin
This is what people mean when they talk about snowflakes and PC-culture. 

Trump 2020
If you are going through a grocery store avoiding meandering old people who have inclusive near and far sight problems and an inability to recall which side of the aisle to roll down, children dashing by looking for lord knows what, people who are rectally connected to their phones 24/7, lazy obese assholes using the store provided Scooters as battering rams, young college aged people searching hopelessly for the mysterious makings of spaghetti and a tsunami of mid aisle cardboard commercial road blocks and focus on one particular different colored cartoon character on an otherwise forgettable cereal box amongst several dozen other cereal brands...

You are actively trying to see racism in anything and everything and would likely be happier in life finding a hobby.
So many people on this thread that just don't 'get it' which is indicitive of why we just can't move forward with racial understanding in today's society. And rather than TRYING to understand and see things from a minority viewpoint, they would rather just point the finger and call others snowflakes, liberals, PC, and the list goes on. 

How about this for perspective. What if all of the corn pops were males, and the only female one just happened to be portrayed in a stereotypical role associated with women. Let's say fetaching coffee for the others or doing ironing while the males were just enjoying themselves and having a good time?  Then again, I don't think anything I can say will change things.
Yeah, that artwork probably shouldn't have made it past some department.
I grew up staring at cereal boxes and it all seems so obvious now. Why am I not scared of tigers? Because they're grrrrreaatt! That's gonna cost me someday. What about "Can't get enough super sugar crisp?" If that bear isn't suspiciously groovy than I must have been turned into a monster by that damn Leprauchan.
It’s literally the only brown one. And it’s not like brown Corn Pops are a thing to begin with...

Edit: My first reaction was that this was a ridiculous overreaction. But the actual picture is bizarre. There are dozens of these characters in the art and literally the only janitor is brown...
Look at this oppression in America, shameful

/s
Fucking hell people need to get a life. Does he have so little going on that an adult man spends time staring at a cereal box?
At least there is a "brown" corn pop.  Not a single white one.  So now I guess I'm offended.  And why do the yellows insist on doing weird shit like drinking out of a mall fountain?  Thats just gross.
People with way too much time on their hands.
Yeah, I've noticed this in all commercials.  Can't have the black guy be subservient either.  Fucking ridiculous.  
Racist. It's not burnt, it's high-melanin corn.
I would hire the brown pop and the rest of those not so brown pops would never get a second interview.  The thing is racist against light colored pops because it makes them all look like irresponsible morons, I am so offended.

/s
I feel like this extreme PC culture is only leading to segregation. No color in white cereal. No black people and white in the photo.
I mean it's literally the only brown one.

Also brown corn pops don't exist other than the totally not intentional burned ones so it is a *bit* suspect.

Edit: I now have mixed feelings as I see that they did go out of their way to include a ninja store which makes me feel very included.
It's a figment of it being done in another art style. If you look the tourists are also a different color and style. The likely had multiple people designing pops and then put a few together.
I guess showing a POC working now is a bad thing and considered racist
Exactly why he got elected. 
What if you bought the cereal and the box was sitting on the table in front of you as you ate your breakfast, and you just happened to realize what was on there? That seems strangely more likely to me.
Yeah, the PC-pussy department should’ve spotted that right away. 
So what? Even if it was a pic of a bunch of white people and then a black janitor, so what? Is it really that bad to be a janitor? It’s a serial box. 
I guess they have as much time as those commenting here..

> I mean it's literally the only brown one.

It's also the only one wearing clothes.
It's also literally the only one wearing clothes of a different shade of color as the rest of the kernels. Who knows, maybe this affected the drawing making it come out a different shade.
Just increases the white supremacist view that everyone should have a paying job that they enjoy.
I'm around your age and have seen the same thing during the 90's and early 2000's.  What's truly sad are the kids who have no idea that things were much better - yet, they'll fight and scream about it like its the greatest offense to humanity.  Aren't there bigger issues to fight about?
There are clearly 2 corn pop mannequins with clothes on as well.
[deleted]
No.  Clearly the artist is a fucking racist! 
No, there are yellow corn around him. It wouldn't be so localized.
U fuckin wot m8
Mannequins are not 'people'.  (not that Puffs are people, but you get the point- it's the only animated, 'living' puff wearing clothes.)
One could make the argument that the 'lighter' puffs are all savages, running around naked, and the 'darker' puff is the only civilized one, as shown by their being clothed.

Keep splitting hairs and you'll become a barber!
That'd be quite a stretch there Armstrong.
So is "why is literally the only brown corn pop on the whole cereal box the janitor? this is teaching kids racism."
Just found this post, I have to say this whole thing is ridiculous. Had my relatives seen that picture,  they'd be hysterical. The sheer number of jokes at the expense of Mexicans would be higher than Willie Nelson at a pot farm.

"Why is the only one working brown?" "Because he's be deported if he showed up at welfare line!"

My uncle actually dropped this gem.
If flint has the best water in the world, it is still going to be one of the most poverty stricken towns in America.

Smart move; lawyers are expensive, after all.
* Extreme inequality
* Epidemics of drug abuse
* Police corruption and police violence
* Political dynasties that enrich themselves selling elections. The Clintons made $250 million dollars in politics.
* Political waves of violence. Blood on the streets outside Trump rallies

* Poor people drinking water with lead
* Falling infrastructure and falling bridges

America is becoming a third world country. What the fuck...

Stop giving Flint money, they can't even manage the money they have properly. The city needs to be shut down, liquidated and turned into an unincorporated town.
Yep...at least their children won't be getting brain damage from lead.  Sure would be nice if the US gov would step in and help when they're spending billions on aid in other countries.
What's the ELI5 version of why Flint is so poor? Is it because of a vehicle plant closing? I saw Roger and Me in high school, but can't recall the details.
I just want to say; first, second, and third world, were originally just terms to describe which countries had soviet/NATO alliances, or neutralities during the Cold War. It had nothing to do with levels of violence, income, the countries GDP, etc.


Though, we've kinda turned it into that.

Dumping out a new bag to find the toy before my sister got downstairs was the only day I didn't have to be roused with bright lights and threats. 
I LOVED cereal toys... its how I made my choice!

My favorites were Winnie-the-Pooh figures that could attach to your spoon or hang off the bowl, and then Cap'n Crunch, Quisp 'n Quake had really cool rings.
Great memories of these as a kid. Sure it's a piece of marketing but it was fun. 


Bring back the Captain Crunch treasure maps! 
Will this only be in Australia?
I would be more excited if they just made their bags resealable.  
Age of Empires was the best toy from a cereal box that a kid could ask for.
Thats a pretty cool nostalgia for me
Could mean hope for Kinder Eggs?
I still have a lot of the old Kelloggs 3d baseball cards from cereal of my youth. Love those things.

I remember having a Trix spoon that would change colors when you put it in milk. I thought it was the most bad ass thing ever. 
I really loved the characters that would hang from the side of the bowl while you ate.

I was a young child in the 1960s, the golden age of cereal box toys.
Quisp was the bomb! You know, you can still find it available from places like Amazon. Bought me a whole case of it. MMM the memories of childhood that poured out of those boxes.

Now all we need is for Screaming Yellow Zonkers to make a comeback.
Wow, I haven't thought about that Pooh spoon and bowl top in years. Thanks for the memory!
I loved sugary cereals as a kid.  If I was to have another child I would not let them eat any of it.

Or watch commercials at all.
I was definitely Quisp rather than Quake, but I was already into sci-fi types of things.

Screaming Yellow Zonkers were great. Forgot about those. I wonder why they failed?

I'm not a doctor, but it seems that the situation would require a significant level of inattention to confuse these two procedures.
The much bigger problem is that they apparently made 8 similar fuck ups in the same year. How does that happen?

Let's see *this* guy's review of being circumcised. All we ever get to hear is the report back from men who *wanted* to be circumcised as adults telling us sex is still as good.
Poor service.  I hope he didn't leave them a tip. 
Peggy, I don't know why. I needed a *circular incision*.
the chart said he needed a "circular incision"
I remember this episode of Married With Children. 
Apparently the service at the hospital was so good he left a tip.  
This also happened to Al Bundy decades ago.
The medical system is in tur-mohel
This sounds like a medical lawsuit wetdream. Barely any damage done but he can sue for an absurd amount.
I'd be suing for every cent that hospital has ever seen.
This happened to a friend of mine when he was a teenager. Went in for appendicitis. Someone with the same name and roughly similar age went in for circumcision. Mix-up ensued. (Not sure if the other guy got his appendix out though)

He never told me about a settlement, but pretty sure he got some money out of it.
Wouldn't the guy be awake and aware for a cystoscopy?
i want to turn this account into a Circumcision Facts Bot and see how fast i can lose 30k karma 
I guess it's circumcision week on reddit?
wait.... do they put you under for a bladder cam? I thought it was just like a nerve block or local, like how they do colonoscopies? 
I cannot imagine how circumcision ever became popular. 
lawyer up and destroy them for MGM. 
It could've been a lot worse.
Welcome to the club buddy.

This was a Married With Children Episode 
Yeah. I would hate to be the one to have to tell him about that massive fuck up
Thought I was on r/nottheonion for a minute
I hope the guy didn't 'Tip' him
That's a pretty fortunate mix up at least
If this happened to me I would kill myself. Being circumcised is horrible, every circumcised man I have had sex with has a dry, leathery and numb penis covered with scar tissue. Circumcision is an evil crime and rarely qualifies as a medical procedure. 
Just circumcise both, problem solved
Imagine the slow news day that this guys had to generate this and call it sensational news. There must be a bonekiller. A downright skinnhammer removal and a ... to many puns. Send help.
This is only half the story. What about the other guy?
Imagine if he was Asian , the cut would be so much deeper 😔
Gets to sue the hospital and got a superior penis for free. Lucky.
Socialized medicine at it's finest.

thank god another circumsicion thread. i was wondering how reddit felt about MANGLED DICKS. anybody got any hot opinons they’d like to share?
Who “ tipped off” the news?
It seems like it would take multiple points of failure. 
It makes no sense.  All members of the “team” know what the procedure is going to be, and the instruments are completely different. 
I’m sorry, wasn’t paying attention. 

Got my watch strap caught on the guy’s foreskin. Nurse do you mind... this is a Rolex.
Doctor doesn't see the patient all the way through from the time they walk into the hospital to the time they walk out. Intake, prep, anesthesia, etc, all done in an assembly line with hand offs. There's checks to prevent that kind of stuff but sometimes the system fails.
Lack of pre-anesthesia checks. We speak out the patient's name and the name of the procedure before we put him to sleep. I'm guessing this hospital doesn't enforce that.
"I picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue" - The Dr. probably.
Not if you mix up the patient. If the urologist had a cystoscopy and then a circumcision next, but mixed them up somehow, this is conceivable. However, hospitals should and do have procedures in place to prevent this from happening, so it is absolutely unacceptable.
The only surgery I've ever been physically present at was my wife's cesarian sections. The first time the surgeon opened with "I'm here for a C-section, is that what everyone else is here for?" The second one just went into the procedure. 

Stories like this really make me appreciate the first surgeon .
just the tip. 
Or really bad handwritting. 
I am a doctor... And yes... It would. A common sense failure being the least of the checks here that need to fall
That's the NHS for you! 
Does this mean some guy got a camera shoved up his penis that he wasn’t expecting. 
soooo,mirosurgery mixup,poor bastard,does melania know?
He was lucky they didn't cut it of. 
Doctors' handwriting should do the trick.
The real issue in this article. Some fuckery is going on at that hospital 
> Wrong patient surgery - two patients with similar name notes merged into one meaning the wrong person had an operation.

Fun fact. I hope this was fixed but back in the day we had problems with paper records and xrays of Kaiser patients. When someone joined and added a spouse or child at the same time, they were issued consecutive Kaiser patient ID numbers. Like 65597013 and 65597014. We’d request Jane Liszt’s xrays and chart for our doctors and they’d send husband George Liszt’s things. This could still be a problem with digital records, especially if they’re same sex spouses or same sex parent and child.
Watch Scrubs. All of it. Shit goes wrong in big hospitals and doctors are human too, meaning they make mistakes. 

You will probably be in shocked disbelief after seeing a lot of the ways the doctors on the show fuck up. Then you need to understand that medical professionals largely declare that this is the most accurate depiction of medicine in media ever made.

Even the intro is an ode to the fact that humans are flawed, broken, and insufficient to the tasks put before us.

It's pretty amazing that the average British uncircumcised dick is gross enough to be confused with one ridden with phimosis though.

You guys are making fun of a guy who lost his foreskin... What the fuck. You should be pricing out nice wood so he can frame that foreskin in his new mansion 😂
Further than that I would imagine a lawsuit pending, though I am sure the hospital’s legal counsel would say that it’s frivolous, that it’s foreskin the issue.
This poor man lost something very important to him and you are leaving a Dad joke???

Have an upvote!!
Free Healthcare doesn't allow tips but sometimes you get the wrong procedure done. 
He left a tip alright. It's the newest currency. Foreskin dollars. 
It was just the tip.
how this isnt the top comment/reference is beyond me. time really has changed and the world passed it by i guess. 
"We were supposed to do a circular incision..."
Ah I miss that show
Well, you see, the doctor wrote "circular incision" on the orders, but they mistook that for "circumcision". That was one of my favorite episodes. He's sitting around in a moomoo and can't get aroused. It's fucking hilarious. 
Good one. Doing a good bris joke can be a bloody mouthful!
This would make a great joke for the Late Night with Seth Myers segment "And now one of my writers explains a joke."
I don’t get it. 
Don't talk about the NHS that way, even if it's true! 
Right? I dont want to say it but , luckyyy
That'd be zero then, as it's a British hospital.
Britain. If they fuck you over, you're fucked. 
While I don’t disagree with his compensation for “pain and suffering” or whatever...

What’s your justification for “every cent that hospital has ever seen”? The procedure is cosmetic and not disfiguring.
Wouldn't that be entirely different kinds of doctors performing those procedures?
I don’t think any amount of money would satisfy the rage this would make me feel. I would have a hard time convincing myself not to follow the doctor home one day to kick his ass.
His dick mush have looked like a stomped out bike tire before the surgery then. No wonder.

Reddit is the only place I've seen people care about circumcision 
This is one of the original Russia bot troll attempts, weirdly. Circumcision is common in the US, and in Europe the divisions are along religious lines. 
Yes they do.
Maybe the surgeon doesn't like the patient to be awake being annoying or something. This seems to have happened at a poor service hospital judging from the article. 
I mean I'm not pro circumcision but I am pro adults being able to do weird shit to their bodies.
You sound like a self entitled asshole.
believe it or not there are many circumcisions that are done quite well and don't look like freddy krueger
I feel like I’m in la la land. You’re circumcised. It’s in your post history. You’re just stretching your skin to make it look like you’re not. Clearly you’re some kind of delusional activist. 
> every circumcised man I have had sex with has a dry, leathery and numb penis covered with scar tissue.

Lol, you're obviously a cheese dick that hates themselves. How fucking pathetic. 
Lol I dont think you know what a circumcision is..
Medical error is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States.
You do realize this kind of thing can happen at any hospital? Even those following the most strict protocols. 

The U.S. Department of Health concluded that approximately 1 in 112,000 surgeries are incorrect and that medical errors in non surgical settings are much more common.

Multiple points of failure are the only ones you ever hear about.  Had this been caught, even at the last instant, no mention would have ever been made.  Given enough chances people will eventually screw everything up.  
Here at Sacred Heart our Doctors **do not** make mistakes! -Bob Kelso
Ive never had an operation without talking with the person performing the procedure. I dont understand how this isnt a common thing
A circumcision without your consent is a rip-off.
Guessing from the circumstances and article information, I think it's a patient mix up. There's a reason why the hospital makes you recite your name, DOB, and see your patient number/scan your band before they do these types of procedures. It's an easy enough mistake to make when you've got a tight OR schedule, the patient isn't under the care of only one surgeon/physician (like a lot of outpatient procedures where chances are the surgeon/physician has not seen you before), and most importantly skipped the proper patient identification procedures. There are redundancies in to try to create a safety net to prevent exactly this but if you're not following procedures, they won't catch anything.

If it *isn't* a patient mix up, I'd be surprised.
If they weren't sure they should have asked for a tip
Interesting. It does seem like maybe you would want family members in particular to have very different patient IDs, since they're likely to have similar names and (in the case of hereditary conditions) medical histories.
Any hospital's protocols should be taking into account that humans are flawed though. This isn't just one person getting it wrong, it's an institutional failure to adopt and enforce procedures that avoid these mistakes. Wrong patient/wrong site mistakes are especially preventable.  
  
[According to one study, your average large hospital might experience one wrong surgical site incident every 5 to 10 years.](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/resources/resource/3621) This group of hospitals had 3 (arguably 4) in just one year. Not only that, two of them were "wrong patient" situations which should be especially rare.
one hospital sucks, free healthcare bad /s
Damn ethics board rejected my proposal to involuntarily circumcise a statistically significant sample of men, so I guess this is the next best thing.
Oh wow you really had me going there
I think wood is the last thing he'll want for awhile.

I hope he's compensated well. People aren't always.
This is UK, he will not be getting mansion damages. They will probably give him a book token or something.
*disclaimer: The following joke only works in the U.S.*  
  
"I knew my hospital visit would cost me an arm and a leg. It would seem you've overcharged me."
I wonder what damages you can even claim in a case like this. The hospital will probably say something like 'millions of men are circumsized, its no big deal, he's not entitled to damages'
> You guys are making fun of a guy who lost his foreskin

Oh, thank god it's just the foreskin!! Beofre I had scrolled to your post, I was misunderstanding what happened because I read "circumsized" and thought "castrated"


You’re thinking of this happening in the US...if he gets a thousand quid from this that’ll be the day 
It isnt firvilous. It is an amputation. The issue is that a foreskin will be deemed very low value. It would probably be valued like losing the tip of an ear. My guess he will get less than 10,000$ although he might be able to swing a foreskin reconstruction instead.
Agreed, it’s really going to rear it’s ugly head. 
First person to say What's Up goes down
Thank you. It’s hard when the subject matter is so soft.
Hahah! Much obliged
Mohel is the term for a Jewish rabbi that does the circumcision procedure. I'm not sure if they have to be a rabbi or can be a doctor or what but something like that
To add to what the other guy explained, "mohel" is usually pronounced like "moyal" (rhymes with "loyal"), so "tur-mohel" sounds like "turmoil".
Nah, just a very apt pun. We’ve got it way worse over here across the Pond
Then the entire campus should be liquidated and the resulting cash should be awarded to the man who the hospital mutilated.
How is it not disfiguring? They have removed part of his penis.
>The procedure is cosmetic and not disfiguring.

The foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))

>What’s your justification for “every cent that hospital has ever seen”? The procedure is cosmetic and not disfiguring.

A circumcision isn't just cosmetic. You're losing skin that protects the head of the penis. Uncircumcised penis heads actually developer callouses on them, this in turn does decrease sensitivity of the penis head.
It is disfiguring, it leaves the head dry and desensitized when they mutilated him
> The procedure is cosmetic and not disfiguring.

You are a terrible, terrible person if you think circumcision is a cosmetic procedure that doesn't result in disfiguration.

The hospital cut part of his penis off. The part that protects the head and that has many nerve endings. It is certainly disfiguring.

He should be awarded every cent that hospital has ever seen, and awarded the lifetime earnings of every nurse and physician involved in mutilating him.

Sex will never be the same for the man.

You have been brainwashed if circumcision doesn't make your blood boil.
The procedure irreversibly removes nerve endings that produce sensations of pleasure during sex. Dude will literally never experience sex the same way again.
Yes. But the same hospital would do both. 
Though it would make me feel better if it really made the hurt for money, or at least those involved
I've seen it happen on other large diverse sites like Gaia.
You also talk about your kinks irl all the time? This is an anonymous plattform where people can discuss about almost everything. People usually dont talk about penises except with their SOs.

They are like the anti-vaxxers of Facebook. Crazy, irrational, ignore evidence, say people die from it (about 100 males a year, world wide, deer are more lethal), and think that anyone who disagrees with them is completely wrong. 
Its an American tradition started by a man who was extremely interested in the genitals of children. Kellogg, yes the same name on cereal, really had a thing for kids masturbating. He tried all sorts of things to fix the problem, as he saw it. Using acid to do FGM and also circumcision were some of his solutions to the problem. In his mind this was a crisis that required desperate measures.

The other American tradition Kellogg started was breakfast cereal. Corn flakes were supposed to be so bland that they would remove the desire to masturbate from kids. The Kellogg company still makes breakfast cereal which is still mostly targeted at children.

Kellogg was a very strange, yet also very successful man.
That is usually what people mean when they say it should be illegal, illegal to do to kids/people who can't consent t
They don't get it done because its 'weird shit' they choose to do it because its medically necessary i.e. when the skin is too tight and everyday things are painful.  
There are also some pathologies where it is an indicated surgical intervention.
[deleted]
Holy shot check out their history. This psychos entire comment history is about foreskin 
attacking my character is always easier than refuting my points. 
No mutilation of a persons genitals can ever be done quite well. The foreskin has wonderful functions, and there is no line where the penis ends and the foreskin begins. Every mammal has a foreskin, because they are wonderful! Having a foreskin is to have a mechanical device on your penis that lubricates it, while the lube also has nerve endings. The foreskin contains 20,000 nerve endings and is connected to the primary orgasmic trigger - the frenulum. Each tissue of the foreskin and penis connects to the next, to trigger orgasm. When you hack off chunks of peoples sexual organs you diminish their ability to feel pleasure. 
I have a functioning foreskin, it mechanically lubricates my penis during sex and masturbation. Following restoration, multiple layers of keratin sloughed off of my glans causing what I would estimate to be a 70% increase in sexual sensitivity. I have been called uncircumcised by four separate doctors that I was visiting for unrelated things like physicals. I believe that every person on earth deserves to have the entirety of their sexual organs. I do not believe that amputating body parts without need makes people more beautiful or functional. 
Not enough functionality. I haven't had smegma in years. It's so easy to clean yourself, it's just basic hygiene. 
You have no basis to determine that. 
Let [circumcisionbot](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_10047217m.jpg) demonstrate for hkm?
It’s not even difficult to stop this. My wife has had several surgeries the past few years. Every time anyone involved in the surgery checks in with her beforehand, they ask what procedure is going to take place and compare it to the medical procedure scheduled. That’s at least a half dozen people checking if the procedure matches the patient. 
It's worse
Is that what they said? At any rate, this happened in the U.K. where most men are uncircumcised 
Still my favorite sitcom.
Sacred Fart?
Same. They talk to you before, they talk to you after. They confirm verbally and via scanning your wristband that you are who they think you are and you're having the right procedure.
[deleted]
I worked in an O.R. for many years. This is absolutely correct. The patient passes through multiple departments and a there’s a lot of opportunity to mix up patients by the registrar, the schedulers, the orderlies, and the nurses before the patient is even in the room. It’s a stressful environment and people make mistakes all the time. It’s actually pretty scary. 
When it comes to tips, this place asks the questions later.
Maybe it was too hard for them to ask for a tip.
Seems to me they didn't ask.
Just one of those things no one thought through ahead of time. Arlington buries the dead consecutively, the government prints paper money serial numbers consecutively, my company issues employee IDs consecutively, Kaiser and who knows who else issued patient IDs that was as well. Seemed logical or practical at the time. In hindsight, not so much.
Agreed.  their policies and procedures are either screwed, or they have some very lax individuals.  Or both.
Ok. What the hell is a book token?
Yea, on paper that sounds good, but in court :"they cut flesh off his genitals." Doesn't sound good


Edit: btw I am cut, so I have no skin in the game. 
Not in the UK
I was just angling for the pun, not trying to trivialize the gentleman’s loss! Obviously, I sympathize and wouldn’t want such a grievous cock-up for anyone! 
I hope he fights as hard as he can in court.
I meant it would be zero *cents*.
Username checks out
I’m not sure you understand what disfigurement entails.

And while you are correct, part of his penis was unnecessarily removed, the overall functionality is relatively i encumbered. A significant number of males throughout history have undergone this exact procedure for health or religious reasons, with no substantial detrimental side effects.

What then is the logic for “every cent...”?

Which is grounds for compensation, agreed. But this in no way supports the comment “every cent...”

It is unnatural, but also the head of a uncircumcised penis is more sensitive (more pleasure) for the male. This is because a circumcised penis will develop callouses on the head due to the lack of protection given by the foreskin.
You're about to get a lot of downvotes from the turtleneck sweater squad.

Pretty sure they store anger inside the loose skin.
>They are like the anti-vaxxers of Facebook.

Fallacy of association.

>Crazy, irrational, ignore evidence

Ad hominem fallacy.

So let's get the conversation started on medical information:


The foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))

Cereal was his brother, chopping up bits was Harvey. Both things were intended to impede masturbation, or "self pollution" as it was called. That whole family was messed up on a whole other level.

Oh, and he put drops of carbolic acid on the clits of girls, to burn away sensitivity, for the same reason. American style FGM. Funny how that didn't catch on the same way, though good that it didn't.
Kellogg was possibly one of the most interesting people in modern history. You’ve barely scratched the surface of how weird he was, actually! 

Corn Flakes were originally developed to serve in his luxury sanatorium, because he thought that serving a bland diet would cure his patrons of, you guessed it, masturbation, which he believed to be responsible for all manner of human ills. Other aspects of the regime at his facility included yoghurt enemas, electric shock, cold water hose-downs, and many other bizarre “treatments”.

John Harvey Kellogg was most probably a sociopath with some really twisted ideas of sexuality, but crediting him personally with the spread of circumcision in America is historically incomplete and medically inaccurate. Although he was a champion of circumcision, he was hardly alone in this. Religious and actual medical reasoning both played roles in cementing the practice in American culture. Even today, the AMA says the research is out on whether it’s a good idea or not. 
I imagine people get circumcised when converting to judaism/islam. Also circumcising because of phimosis is an absolute last resort, typically just stretching can fix it.
Having a mix up at the hospital is my biggest fear. When I was getting a hip replacement just as I was getting knocked out I thought I heard them say "right side" and it freaked me out , cuz it was my left I needed it done on. They draw on you and shit and triple check so I was fine, but still a huge fear
Decided to take your word for it and not bother clicking through :p
Making light of suicide is callous and insensitive.
You are way to adamant about this...  Go find a new focus.
You’re like a black guy that had their skin lightened and became a racist. 
[removed]
Thats why it doesn't happen all that often . . . and it is recognized that the systems in place should not allow it to happen. Also usually the mistake isn't as bad as a completely different procedure . . . like maybe they just mess up which side of the body a surgery occurs (correct patient, correct surgery, wrong location). 
That is what they said. They said that anyone who hasn't been marked as a slave via penile mutilation is a dirt bag.
Did you see the sign? heh heh, Tho there will be no vandalism at Sacred Heart!
But did he leave a tip?
Well at least he left a tip even with the terrible mixup. 
Yeah, I definitely wouldn't have thought of that beforehand.
That's what they call a post-it note, probably for writing an apology 
on. They got weird names for everything over there.
You mean... *it makes no cents?*
 
BTW: Did you know that Americans call their 1 cent coin a penny?
Just because something has been happening for a long time doesn't justify its validity.
You could defend FGM as well with that logic. Gtfo here
> no substantial detrimental side effects

You are brainwashed.
Dude stop taking everything that is said about circumcision so personally. Clearly some of these arguments are making you uncomfortable so you have some things to explore but you really don't need to be so defensive.
>Which is grounds for compensation, agreed. But this in no way supports the comment “every cent...” 

Every cent is too much, agreed. But it isn't just a cosmetic issue either. 
Every cent they've ever made, every asset they have should also be liquidated and awarded to the man they mutilated without his consent.
They worded it poorly, but the glans does get keratinized after circumcision.  Compare a picture of the glans of a circumcised and intact penis, and you'll see quite a difference when the foreskin is protecting the glans.
Your parents gave consent. They wanted a doctor to mutilate their baby. The way you were born was not good enough for your parents. They wanted you to be marked as a slave for life.

That's a discussion you need to have with your parents. You aren't entitled to sue the pediatrician.

Your penis mutilation is nothing like the man in this article.

I do not drive up the cost of healthcare. You are making a false equivalency.

If anyone has their penis mutilated without consent, they should absolutely be entitled to every cent that the doctor and healthcare facility has ever made our ever will make.

I believe that the doctor should be jailed for life along with having his estate turned over to the man who was mutilated.

You are a very, very brainwashed individual, and you have been blocked as of this message.
i’ve seen tinder profiles that say “must be circumcised” 
Well, bringing up other people's dicks on Reddit is pretty weird. I'm circumcised, never had a problem with callouses, sensitivity, anything like that. Also never had any dick related medical issues, so there's that too. 
You're responding to an article about a hospital that saw a dudes uncircumcised penis and decided it needed to be fixed because it was so fucked up. In Britain, lol.
Hey man, the girls out here like mine the way it is so I see no harm no foul.

Quite the contrary, many girls I know say they find uncut dicks gross. 
you mean like how everyone in this thread does to people who are circumcised?
Tell the hospital who had to urgently fix it. 
I did no such thing, I was just saying that I find my dick to be good looking, as do most woman
as a circumcised man i’m gonna have to dispute all that, but thanks

Whoa I have calluses on the tip? I can’t see them, can you check? Better get real close. 
>You're about to get a lot of downvotes from the turtleneck sweater squad.

>Pretty sure they store anger inside the loose skin.

Yea, let's just make physical alterations to people that can't decide for themselves that serve no medical purpose.
I knew it was coming. But their internet words can't hurt me. Girls fin my dick more attractive on average, in my experience
You literally made a Reddit account to debate this? Dude, you're proving my point. 

Edit: Jesus Christ. You've had this account for a year, literally only being anti-circumcision. Like if anyone has proved my point of you being crazy as fuck like an anti-vaxxer, it's you. You are the exact example I need.
John Harvey Kellogg did indeed invent corn flakes. His brother, Will, supposedly also helped out on the cereal.
I'm being completely and entirely literal. If I woke up from surgery, and found that I was circumcised, I would kill myself. I would hopefully kill the doctor that did it first. 
I live in a country where a sizable portion of the population is strapped down at birth and has about half of their penis cut off. This causes PTSD, increases your perception of pain permanently, causes between a 10-90% loss of sexual sensitivity, increases the rate of ED after 40 dramatically, and makes it more difficult to have sex or masturbate. There is no greater crime facing men and women than genital mutilation. I stand for the right of all people to have their genitals be whole. 
You're attacking my character and not refuting my points. My penis is dramatically more sensitive and it is self-lubricating. Please explain how this could possibly be a bad thing. Explain how wanting everyone to enjoy sex the way nature intended is somehow like racism?
Well if I don't wash under my hood for about 5 days I could help you out. Unfortunately, I shower daily. 
Women also produce smegma, so if you want to use smegma as an excuse to cut peoples genitals, you'll have to propose attacking them as well. Luckily, FGM is rare in the world. We must eradicate all genital mutilation, it is our moral imperative. 
The only thing the doctors got to keep.
What are flip flops called
Lmao. I never would have guessed that. What the fuck
Same as in Great Britain.
Though it does allow for a substantial amount of data to be collected on the subject... data which proves that, while generally regarded as unnecessary by hygienic cultures, it is not substantially harmful to a male and does not inhibit his ability to function as such.
Defending the circumstances was never my intent. I simply wondered at the justification for “every cent...blah blah blah”

[removed]
I am mutilated, people who are don't deserve shame, but those who support it and had it done tot their kids with no reason or dumb reasons like religion or believing it looks better do deserve mountains of shame
>as a circumcised man i’m gonna have to dispute all that, but thanks 

Don't take it personally, I'm sure your penis is still great. 

I would like for people to stop making physical alterations to new borns that are not medically needed. Circumcision can be done later in life if the individual wants it.

I have yet to meet an uncircumcised man that wants to be circumcised, but I have met many circumcised men that wish to be uncircumcised.
>So you have callouses all over your foreskin?

No, the penis head is a very sensitive gland, it develops the small callouses from rubbing against clothing. The foreskin (like other skin) is very much able to withstand brushing up and against clothing.

Edit: Glans not Gland! Leaving the typos for those that might get a laugh out of it.
>Whoa I have calluses on the tip? I can’t see them, can you check? Better get real close. 

Well, I am gay, so I'll do a full inspection. 

But yeah. They are very very small callouses all over it. If you compare the head of a circumcised and uncircumcised penis, you'll see that uncircumcised penis head will be a lot smoother.
Never said anything about how to treat your kids. Or kids as a whole.

Cut out the snark and roll that anger back up in your wizard sleeve.
And now you're implying you've had sex, with multiple women. May God have mercy, because reddit wont. you brave soul.
Ad hominem fallacy.

And what did you say about ignoring medical information?
I stand corrected, and intact, thank the gods I don't believe in.
>I would hopefully kill the doctor that did it first.  

Odds are the doctor performed the surgery he was instructed to perform; the mix up probably happened before you were ever wheeled into his OR by people not the doctor.  

If you truly believe what you said, I seriously suggest you consult a mental health expert. You're talking about suicidal and homicidal ideation at this point, and that is far from healthy. There is help available.
Get off the internet, dude... 
I think you need new doctors if they think the foreskin is half a penis.
>Being circumcised is horrible, every circumcised man I have had sex with has a dry, leathery and numb penis covered with scar tissue.

Because of that shit, asshole. 

Edit: FYI, I’ve seen tons of circumcised dicks that look better than yours.

Mutilation is mutilation. It doesnt matter if it has any impact later on. Tattooing someones face while they sleep doesnt harm them either its still bodily harm. 
I was mutilated and last time I checked my penis was not fine 
r/iamverysmart
> It is my experience that irrational people making irrational arguments respond less often to absurdist retorts.

So you're responding with absurdity hoping that they won't respond back? That's an attempt to shut down the conversation, when it would be much easier to simply not participate if you didn't want to talk about it. I think you're acting defensively and just don't recognize the ways in which you are taking this personally.
>I meant primarily to depreciate the severity of the actual procedure; as a circumcised male, I can appreciate the effect of the sensitivity loss, but I can’t also enjoy the stamina that comes along as well. 

There is also some correlation between early Erectile Dysfunction and circumcision.

>You are correct. It is more than a purely cosmetic procedure; it is not something a typical adult male will request.

It is actually a procedure very very few people medically require.
As another circumsized dude, it's entirely okay for you to feel fine about your circumcision and I can admire that you were attempting to make someone else feel better about theirs.

However, in situations where we are discussing someone's pain or trauma, it is inappropriate to attempt to minimize the severity of the situation. It makes light of a very challenging situation and is often times insulting to the party experiencing pain or trauma.
Saving future generations of women from you dick cheese. 
You must not be hanging out with beautiful California girls, friend
Literally never met a circumcised man that wish it hadn't happened. Think you're getting meeting people with randoms on the internet 
So it’s simultaneously more sensitive from a lack of foreskin and less sensitive from the calluses? Is there a quantifiable difference in the net result that’s been shown in scientific studies? 
>Never said anything about how to treat your kids. Or kids as a whole.
>
>Cut out the snark and roll that anger back up in your wizard sleeve.

Lol, you're the one calling natural penises turtlenecks
Hey man, I already have too many internet points. Won't hurt if people try to take a few away. They hate us cause they aint us :)
My argument was that people who are strongly anti-circumcision are like anti-vaxxers, and stated that their attitude is identical. You're not responding to that argument, you're responding to the pro/anti-circumcision argument. But you literally proved my point by existing. Proving that you are indeed as dumb as an anti-vaxxer. The truth is, there is no actual medical evidence stating one way or the other if circumcision is good or bad. It's used to treat medical issues, such as recurrent bladder/yeast infections, or done so as a religious/parental/personal preference. You're just going all nut job about it. You care way too much about other dude's dicks bro. 
My advice to you then, is to not try to saw off parts of my genitals. 
Again...attacking character is always easier than refuting a persons points. 
Based on nerve ending quantity, yes it is. 
I stand behind my opinions, they are based on intense thought and study.
probably shouldn't try to do it yourself then. I get nothing but compliments on my superior looking penis.
People who debate with throw away accounts are generally wrong. Thats a general observation I've found. If you can't stand behind your argument in full view, you have no argument. 
[removed]
Guess I can be your first!
>So it’s simultaneously more sensitive from a lack of foreskin and less sensitive from the calluses?

No, the penis head is a gland. It is very sensitive skin. There's a reason you can't just rub the head without lubrication.

The foreskin protects this sensitive gland.

Without the foreskin, the penis head (the gland) will become less sensitive due to the very small callouses.

With the foreskin, the penis head is protected, thus it will maintain higher sensitivity.

Don't forget Kellogg's wanted children to be circumcised so that they'll stop masturbating.

Edit: Glans not Gland! Leaving the typos for those that might get a laugh out of it.
> strongly anti-circumcision are like anti-vaxxers

Fallacy of association. You can't/don't address anti-circumcision so you liken it to something else, and then blow it down.

I see that fallacy 1-2 more times. If you want to make an argument, you have to make it on its own basis, not likening it to something else.


Then you ignore the medical information: The foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)) 

For infections: [“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) This is a terrible statistic. 

And UTIs are treated with antibiotics, not circumcision. If there is a urinary tract anomaly, that can be individually assessed and a circumcision individually prescribed for that patient. That's not an argument for routine circumcision.


>You're just going all nut job about it.

Here you're projecting your own emotions on to others. I've presented medical information.

>You care way too much about other dude's dicks bro. 

Ad hominem fallacy.

In actuality I want people to decide for themselves. I don't care what they decide for their own body.
Again, seek help.
You can think I'm insane and there's not much I can do about it. There are entire nations of doctors that agree with me. Male genital mutilation is rare outside the United States, Israel and a few other countries. Scandinavian countries have the lowest rates and have lower rates of STDs, ED, and their men report higher rates of sexual satisfaction. Circumcision is a fad that is diminishing in the United States, as people wake up to the remarkable harm that we are doing to our men. 
I didn't fucking do it myself, and who cares about superior looking, that is all a social construct. I care about superior feeling and working, which is what I would have had had my parents not had a doctor mutilate me
Went to college in the Midwest, did just fine there too.

I'm between 25 and 30
Like I said only randoms on the internet 
Okay, so I’m just trying to understand (and it’s glans, not gland, but I assume you got autocorrected) - a circumcised glans is more sensitive for X period of time until micro-callouses build, which in turn makes it less sensitive?

Is there any scientific study you can show that has measurable data that shows the net result of these two effects? I’m wondering if the net result is less sensitivity or more; having both doesn’t really make sense at the end result.

Keep on downplaying other's legitimate complaints and greivances, you're great at it!
I thought cornflakes were invented to put a stop to this sort of genital tomfoolery. 
Taking "Pissed in my Corn Flakes" literally...
I didn't know that R. Kelly worked at Kelloggs

How proud do you think they are of that caption, though? 'Urine trouble?' How long was someone waiting to use that?
Not my puffed rice cakes 😢
You might want to avoid Kellog's Krispies for a while
Urine is quite sterile. Nothing to worry about, kids. Eat your cornflakes.
Yup, I am never eating Kelloggs again, that's for sure. 
It's not considered genital tomfoolery until third shake. 
I learned about this from The Young Turks' channel on YouTube.  Their headline was "Rice Kris-Pees", a little more on the nose considering only puffed rice products were affected. :P
If you read the article it said this video was taken in 2014 and "A statement from the company said products 'potentially affected' by the urine would be past their expiration dates by now."
Urine itself is sterile (if you're a healthy adult) but the hose you piss out of is hardly so.   That's why when you go in for a urine sample, you have to wipe down with an alcohol wipe before peeing into the cup.

This is pretty disgusting really, and it will hurt other workers in the Kellogg factories when they are monitored and put under a magnifying glass for something they were not a part of.   I hope this disgruntled "Scumbag Steve" employee is still proud of himself when he's in jail.
Well, it's not difficult to game that system. Look, I'm doing it now. 
I dab. Do you dab?
> If you read the article it said this video was taken in 2012

It said 2014. That said, the affected cereal has likely already been eaten.
The corn flakes were likely fed to someone's kid. 
Maybe you're just that one guy who doesn't want to eat a bowl of piss-soaked cornflakes.

Have you even *tried* piss-soaked cornflakes?
My mistake! Taken in 2012 and expired in 2014. Either way nasty af
Thanks, I will remember next time I'm in the store looking at the choices of Kelloggs products I probably won't buy now.
[This guy](http://www.funnypica.com/top-30-funny-ugly-people-pictures/ugly-and-crazy-man/) can make it happen.
Again, the affected products have long since been consumed.
In other words, outsourced somewhere.

Carrier just outsourced 2300 jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico when it closed a profitable plant.  The goal was to be slightly more profitable.
what do they manufacturer at that plant? 
   Help with transition????   Today employed - soon to be unemployed, here is the paperwork you may need.    

    The company tried to bully the employees by dangling a bailout for 4 additional years in 2015.     Corporate Profits most important.
150 "roles" will be "impacted"? This the PC way of saying 150 people will lose their jobs?
That Mike Pence is sure looking out for his state. /s
>  The goal was to be slightly more profitable.

Slightly is a bit of an understatement. For what I remember the average employee at Carrier (union that is) was making something 23 per hour with full benefits. That's four times what it costs in Mexico. I am very much against jobs being moved overseas, but when the average employee on the shop floor makes nearly as much as the engineer that designed the entire system there's a problem. 
Yes. They've been selected for the manager attrition program so they can be right-sized to make Kellogg leaner and meaner. 

Or, as we used to say, laid off or transfered.
Where are engineer's making $23 an hour at?
There's been a quality of life gap between the first and third worlds for centuries.

What's new, in this country, is the government has recently caved to corporate interests and finally made it attractive for them to outsource labor, without the traditional tariffs and tax burdens.  This is NAFTA in action and the next piece is TPP which will take intellectual property jobs.

The only beneficiaries are the corporate execs, unless you believe in trickle down.
> makes nearly as much as the engineer

That's what I put. Average starting salary for an entry level engineer is roughly 50k or 25 an hour. 
The average Engineer, even in the lowest form(civil) is making more then a starting wage of $23 an hour.
Ugh. I didn't realize Kellogg owned Kashi. Marketing is an amazing thing. 
For the quick skimmers, it appears that most of the ingredients were added vitamins and compounds to bind or make the vitamins more digestible.

> mong the ingredients listed in the suit were pyridoxine hydrochloride, calcium pantothenate, hexane-processed soy ingredients, ascorbic acid, glycerin and sodium phosphate.

* pyridoxine hydrochloride = Vitamin B6
* calcium pantothenate = Calcium
* hexane-processed soy ingredients = Not exactly sure but there is a big deal about [Hexane processed products and organic foods](http://www.buycott.com/campaign/376/avoid-hexane-processed-soy-products).
* ascorbic acid = Vitamin C
* glycerin = helps bind the vitamins
* sodium phosphate = leavening agent / helps control food pH

** I am a layman not a nutritionist.  Someone with better qualifications please correct any mistakes.

Yeah, most "natural" brands are actually owned by the biggest corporations in the industry.  
Pantothenic acid is also Vitamin B5. Calcium Pantothenate is a calcium salt of it, and yes you can get calcium along with vit B5. 

Hexane is used widely as an organic solvent to extract other organic oil and fats from soybean and other plant matters. It is then evaporated, but I'm sure some very minute amount would remain among the extracted oil. (not much unlike cookign with wine. most of the alcohol will be evaporated by cooking but some will remain.)
Sure, but is it *artisan*.
We have two options.  Regulate or litigate. Pick one.  Litigation is often better in that those 'harmed' have incentive to file suit (or in a case like this, lawyers have incentive to take up a class action). Regulation may be better when litigation doesn't work well or firms are judgement proof from liability. 
There really isn't a better way because corporations lie. The consumers aren't the only ones lacking responsibility. It's the culture and it was started at the top.

I will be sure to avoid these companies that pander to scaremongers and pretend that generations of GMO  use and studies mean nothing against the conspiracy theories of special snow flakes.  First world social justice junk. 
That's quite the run-on sentence there:)  What have you got against GMOs?  Why do you think people should be scared to eat them?
You are right.  I am not sure whether to be proud or horrified at that run on sentence.  I have nothing against GMO's as per my comment bashing the scaremongers. Pro science doesn't scare people; the other side does. 
I agree, but i don't think fighting labeling is such a great idea.  No one is stopping the GM industry from engaging in pr and education any more than they are stopping the organic food industry.  If consumers want to know, that's their right.  I just don't see how labeling gm products is automatically considered negative.  That sounds more like the ant-GM viewpoint.

As for consumers, if the producers of GM products are fighting labeling tooth and nail, what impression would you get about GM products?  It just seems to play to the anti-GM crowd.
Mandatory GMO labeling implies that there is something to be concerned about and will be used against GMO's as soon as it is instated.  There will be real harm done to a science that although potentially dangerous, has also the potential to save the human race from starvation.  
I just don't see how you can build consumer confidence in a product if the producers think it needs to be hidden from consumers.  GMO products aren't going to get over that hump by promoting secrecy.

The worst part of this argument is trying to say openness will damage science. Secrecy and concealing information is what damages science.

As for the whole starvation thing, that's not really the focus of GMO.  It's more about developing products with traits that boost profits or promote herbicide use for ease of production.  

We have enough food, it's just not evenly distributed.  Starving people, lacking funds to import food, need water and topsoil.  Super expensive gmo seeds aren't going to make a difference.

I think that governments should be involved more in gmo development, independent of corporate producers, so there can be more focus on what struggling people actually need, like plants that grow in saline environments or plants with self-fertilizing qualities of legumes, vs purely commercial development.
Until we see "warning product contains high fructose corn syrup" or "contains non organic grains"  I don't see that this is a secrecy issue. I stand by my last statement.  There are far more GMO's that are not in the herbicide tolerant category than in it. They just don't get the news bites or coverage for obvious reasons.

Why would Kellogg or any other company pay "above market" wages?  I'm certainly not going to pay above-market prices for my breakfast cereal.

This was my first thought as well...
Because this will shift money from the poor to the extremely wealthy again. Cutting salary should be a last resort for a company.

I can assure you that the prices wouldn't get any lower.
That sounds very subjective.

I think where they went wrong was neglecting to mention that it improved those things when compared to eating no food at all.

He changed his mind about black people in 1978 to save the LDS church from taxation, in the early 19th century he stopped polygamy to save Mormon leaders from federal investigation and just now he's banning gays in light of a new supreme court ruling that has far reaching legal implications. 
I just got off the phone with God, he says this guy is full of shit.

>"Each of us during that sacred moment felt a spiritual confirmation," he said, reports CBS affiliate KUTV. "It was our privilege as apostles to sustain what had been revealed to President Monson."

Isn't it funny how revelations from god always seem to confirm their own beliefs and desires? 
So what's God's policy on lying like a bitch and persecuting people?
>Go and fuck thyself

  Book of Mormons (somewhere in the back)
The mormons also believe that jesus visited the Americas. 
I have a general distaste for blind faith, but Mormons do take it to a hole other level
Mormons are known homophobes, racists, misogynists and young Earth believers (they believe its 6,000 years old).

Lets all make sure Mormons understand what everyone else thinks about them.  They are not "clean cut, honest, decent people".  They are homophobic, racist and sexist. Lets hang those labels around their necks and let them walk with them. 
Which plate and peepstone were used for this revelation? 
My god says Mormons have to lick my balls for Jesus.  Ya gotta do it!
I would worry more that this dweeb thinks god talks to people.
If this ends up reducing their membership in the long run, I see it as a win.  Policies like this are already taking their toll on Catholicism.
Mormonism is almost as fucked up as Scientology 

You can't drink coffee, but you can drink a red bull? Cmon
>Mormon leader says policy against gay marriage was word from God.

One of many reasons that I reject the bible.

Hey, rich fuckers, Jesus told you to sell your shit and give money to the poor! Did he *stutter?*

Christian reading comprehension: 1/10.
And as an otherwise private entity, more power to them.
Who cares it's their belief and their rights. Their idiots but that's also their right. Why would any Gay person want to be a part of a religion that does not want you. Or anyone else for that matter. Go find a religion that wants ya and let these silly people to their own devices. JMO 
God loves American politics, it's why Eden was in Missouri, I guess. And magic ~~beans~~ stones.
There will be yet another revelation soon reversing this policy. Mark my words, save my post.
I also just recently had a conversation with God and I received the same message.
I believe you. I have faith. 
If God hates what you hate, chances are youve made him up.
"Gods always behave like the people who make them." - Zora Hurston
That one's minor to me - they believe there were steel weapons, huge armies, domesticated horses, and various Old World foods in the pre-Columbian Americas.  DNA tests have refuted (or at least whittled down) idea of the Native Americans as the Lost Tribes of Israel.

Still, the "dark skin mark of evil" and idea that by raising or converting Native Americans to Mormonism they would eventually turn "white and delightsome" is just disturbing.
And that being black is a curse.
Dude could walk on water, I imagine he visited everybody. 
More likely than rising from the dead.
There's usually a sheet involved.
So why are they growing so fast? 
They can't drink *hot drinks*. Which means that iced coffee is OK.

As usual, the religious misunderstand what they're supposed to do and not do.
And more power to everyone else for calling the private entity a bunch of twats.
NAMBLA is a private entity.
As soon as the no longer get tax breaks and subsidies,You'll be right.


It would be nice if they stop knocking on my door though.
Good for them, sticking to their beliefs instead of caving to popular demand. It's a religion, your social agenda is irrelevant, Reddit. The easiest thing for them to do would be to ignore the contradiction, or change the church to adapt to what's popular right now. 

 To brand everyone in a religion a sexist, racist, or whatever like someone did in this thread is just plain ignorant. Disagree with their beliefs, their preferences, whatever you want, but don't be a hypocrite. 

Also, as far as the "from God" part goes: the whole basis of a lots of religions is communication with deity. To criticize them for believing communication with deity is still possible while upholding some past communication with deity is hypocritical.

Lots of vitriol here from people that would never join a religious group anyway, your opinion is irrelevant, true believers would even say their own opinion is irrelevant. There are plenty of Mormons who have gay family members and love them and include them, whether they still go to church or not. 
Kids don't have a choice about either their parents' religion or their own sexual orientation.  A great deal of psychological, spiritual, and emotional damage can be done in those first 18 years to any kid who happens to be homosexual.
So the people who made Zeus like turning into golden mists snd impregnating women?

Eh, everyone needs a hobby I guess.
> DNA tests have refuted ~~(or at least whittled down)~~ 

No need to defang a thoroughly true statement. The LDS is a proven scam founded by a known charlatan, based entirely on plagiarized 19th century cons inspired by first century ignorant superstitious nonsense.  
Well, it sort of is. Racism is alive and well in the world.
Walk across the entire Atlantic Ocean? Nonsense. He travelled here on his flying dinosaur.
They aren't growing any faster than normal population growth despite having big families. Only 30% of the number they claim are actually active. They aren't growing really. 
And thus you have discovered the two-way street of free speech.

Yay you!
All religious organizations are exempted from taxes. Much like any other non-profit organization.

Subsidies, on the other hand, are largely a myth.
Next time they come to your door, give them this link:  www.cesletter.com

Challenge them to read it.  It will destroy their faith.
"Hey, isn't Ammon Bundy a Mormon?  And Warren Jeffs?  And Glenn Beck?"
Come up with your own spiel, and jump right into it when you open the door.  Practice it so you can recite it at great length and not let them get a word in.  They'll leave you alone.
A locked gate prevents this.
Some might even say that the Mormon Church is doing them a favor. By either finding themselves a more tolerant sect or becoming disillusioned with religion all together, they are escaping what many of the commenters in this thread consider a fate worse than death.
how did you get in here? have an upvote for using common sense, logic, and reason.

I am not LDS and do not promote their church but I respect their right to worship to believe what they wish and not not be mocked.
Raised Mormon,  will confirm.
I'm not hay,  but holy shit,  I got so much shame dumped on me for any expression of sexuality. Among other things,  my parents took me to a therapist when I was 13 (my first of many) because I was masturbating, and they wanted him to make me stop.

30 years later and I'm still very tightly wound up about sex.
True but you won't change the minds of a religious community. It's unfortunate. 
Don't forget casting lightnight bolts, ac5s, lrm 15s, and large lasers. 
Before the internet, our ancestors had more modest imaginations of grandeur.
I'm not at home,  so I can't find the reference,  but IIRC one of the leaders in the Mormon church (Dallin Oaks? ) dais something about facts that didn't promote faith not being useful. I.e., ignore facts that conflict with religion.

EDIT: Found [it](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2012/11/d_michael_quinn_and_mormon_excommunication_the_complicated_life_of_a_mormon.html). "There is a temptation for the writer or teacher of church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith-promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very useful."
Oh, I know that.  What I meant was the pro-Mormon *argument* being made has been whittled down.  To the lost tribes being just a tiny percentage of the overall Native population, thus explaining the complete lack of genetic or archaeological or linguistic evidence.
[Nope.](https://www.secularhumanism.org/fi/vol_32/4/cragun_32_4.pdf)

And they cite all their sources.
You're not the only one, a lot of people are tightly wound up about sex because of various punishments they received when young.  Just keep telling your story whenever you have a chance to do so.  The message will eventually get through.

Edit, this not to my knowledge related to Mormons, but thought you might be interested,

>In 1850, the New Orleans Medical & Surgical Journal declared masturbation public enemy number one, warning: "Neither plague, nor war, nor smallpox, nor a crowd of similar evils, have resulted more disastrously for humanity than the habit of masturbation: it is the destroying element of civilized society."

>"Scientific" declarations like these inspired Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (brother of the Corn Flakes Kellogg) in his campaign to eradicate masturbation from the United States.

>Though widely considered to be one of the leading sex educators of his day, Kellogg proudly claimed never to have had intercourse with his wife in over four decades of marriage.

>As a medical doctor, Kellogg claimed the moral authority to instruct parents on the proper sexual education of their children. If you're unfamiliar with the writings of Kellogg and others like him, their gloating disdain for basic human eroticism is chilling and unmistakable. In his best-selling Plain Facts for Old and Young (written on his sexless honey- moon in 1888), Kellogg offered parents guidance for dealing with their sons' natural erotic self-exploration in a section entitled "Treatment for Self-Abuse and its Effects:"

>A remedy which is almost always success- ful in small boys is circumcision. . . . The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anaesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment. . . . 
It's difficult to believe that average Mormons are as depersonalized as their current leaders.  Those believers may be ignorant, but they're still human, and some of them have homosexual kids they most likely love.
Fair enough.  Thanks for the clarification.  
Absolutely. But most are in that religion cause they believe in it and what the leaders say is the word of God. I hope those that need to find somewhere else to practice their faith but the majority will not budge. :(
It's interesting that they're doing it on the Kellogg building, or near it. Wasn't Kellogg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg a flaming racist? 
How can this be "racist", since being Jewish is not a "race"? (That's what anti-semitic usually means, is  anti-jewish).
Throw these nazis in jail for a long time
Jews are an ethnicity, religion, & culture & they mix & match inconsistently, so it's muddy waters ([*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4A6xx65WU))
The article states that the graffiti was racist *and* anti-semitic. So it could have been directed at more than one group.
Yes it is a race. Judaism is an ethnoreligious group.
I wouldn't really consider them to be an 
"ethnicity" so much, but I agree with the rest of it.
Maybe. But unless it was anti-human, I still wouldn't see it as being "racist", because that is the only "race" there is - Human. Everything else is just window dressing.
I do not view it that way. As I have said before, there is only one race - human. Everything else is either window dressing or divisive bullshit.
Yeah well most consider them a race.

You have the right to your opinion, but very few people will agree with you.
It's good that you see race that way, many don't.
You aren't getting it, man.

The vast majority of people do believe races exist, and insisting upon your viewpoint in discussion only acts as an obstacle for you.
LOL. Such is usually the case with my opinions, so I am kind of used to it. :)

I have found that common opinions, or "common knowledge" is usually neither all that common, nor actual knowledge .......
Yep, I know. But I have always held this opinion, even as a child. It just did not make sense to me to equate skin color with race, ya know? With a specific culture? Possibly, but that is even a stretch.

And being Jewish? That is merely a religion, so I cannot possibly see how it could be connected to or called a "race" any more than, say, Presbyterian.
Don't care about obstacles, and don't really care so much about what everybody else believes. My opinions are my own, and not likely to change based on what everybody else thinks.

You are the one who isn't "getting it".
Jews are both an ethnicity and a religion. 
If you enjoy arguing with people, go right ahead and be ignorant and bitch at people trying to give you advice.
Maybe. I will definitely go for more than just simply a religion, although I am not so certain about the "ethnicity" thing.
Not ignorant, and not bitching. Just have my own opinion, and am stating it.

Advice? For the most part, that is worth exactly what you pay for it - nothing.
It's been proven in a few studies.
For the record, you weren't contributing much, just bickering.
Various people have differing opinions on what "proven" actually means .... and "studies" can easily be biased or flawed in many ways to prove or support whatever it is you are looking for. 

I consider such things to be no more reliable or trustworthy than anything else as far as establishing "facts".
Just expressing my opinion is all. 

If by "contributing" you mean agreeing with whatever everybody else is saying, or only saying things they want to hear .... well, then, maybe yer right. I don't do a whole lot of that kind of stuff, as I don't really believe in it. I pretty well say what I think, and if people like it - cool. If they don't, well, that's okay too. Everybody has that choice, and I don't make a big deal out of it. Whether people like it or not has little (none) influence on whether or not I will change my mind, though.

:)
This is not news, this is sensationalism. Given the event, everything performed exactly as intended. Here's a hint, nuclear power plants SCRAM all the time **because they treat every minor malfunction as a critical system failure.** [Here's a link to all the reportable events to the NRC for this year.](http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2012/) You'll find a majority of those events involved a reactor SCRAM. 

Please learn about nuclear power generation, the general public is so misinformed and frightened about nuclear power that they jump in the opposite direction at its mere utterance.

Just to further drive home the point, why aren't we reading news articles that start like this:

>"The Kellogg Cereal plant unexpectedly shut down it's Corn Flakes manufacturing line today due to one of the conveyor motors seizing. No one was hurt but Kellogg will sustain downtime on its Corn Flakes line as the faulty motor is evaluated for failure and repaired." 

Shitty economy, embassy attacks and now Three Mile Island? Gonna party like it's 1979.
People should also take the time to read up on Chernobyl and everything which led to the meltdown.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster

A poorly designed reactor operated by people without a full understanding of nuclear energy disabled safety systems while running a test outside of normal operating procedures. The safety and operational procedures of the plant were also considered lacking for the time. Some still debate on if the blame falls on the design or the operators. It required a great number of things to go wrong in just the right way for the disaster to occur.
Thank you! I don't understand why nuclear power went from being hailed in the 60s and 70s to being condemned in the 21st century. I think perhaps it a mix of misinformed "environmentalists" (read: yuppies who falsely think they are helping a legitimate cause), media sensationalism, and big oil/gas/coal companies trying to get us to switch to "safer" energy.

Nuclear power is safe and effective. We need more of it to tie us over until we can diversify our portfolio of energy sources, such as a large mix of solar, geothermal, wind, wave, eventually thorium reactors, and some day fusion power.
Mostly Big Oil/Gas/Coal.
