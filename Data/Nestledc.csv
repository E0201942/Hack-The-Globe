So.... who did they sell the US business to?! 

This article is absolute shit, so maybe I missed it.
F Nestle. One the real scum companies out there.
Well yeah. Stealing water to sell to idiots is way more profitable.
So we can ethically eat those now?
Looks like Froneri. Which is a global mega corporation that is part owned by Nestle. So basically they sold it to themselves in an already existing global brand.
PAI Partners, a european private equity group, so we can expect shitty quality at higher prices.
Can‚Äôt expect good articles from Fox...
FOX Russian Newz does kind of suck.
In other words, H√§agen-Dazs is back on the menu

Edit: I guess not
Nope, the have partial ownership of the company they sold to.
Not of you're buying them at a grocery store.
Thanks, because the word spaghetti of that article made it very difficult to understand. It sounded like they just sold the European part of the business to them, and hid the fact that they were also going to take over the US portion like 3 paragraphs deep.

So in the end this is pretty meaningless.
So I guess I still won't buy those products.
One corporate exec sold it to another corporate exec because he was tired of dealing with it?
They sold it to a company they have part ownership of though. So they'll still be profiting from the sales.
Pretty much. And F their Toll House cookies too. Pillsbury for the win.
Nope, they sold it to a firm that they still partially own.
What's wrong with grocery stores? Where else should I be getting my food?
It looks like it‚Äôs a way to suck value out of name brands like Haagen-Daaz while lowering quality and raising prices.  Eventually those brands will be worth nothing and will be sold off at a lower price.
You'd have to make everything yourself if you want it 100% ethical
I guess I'll have to plant a hot dog tree.
> ‚Äú[Nestl√©] extracting water and sending it to other places where it cannot return to the water table, and, critically, doing so faster than the aquifer can replenish, is an ‚Äòirretrievable‚Äô depletion unless the pumping is reduced or halted,‚Äù the judges wrote.

Good to see we have some sensible judges in Michigan.
So Nestle is trying to claim that bottled water is an essential public service, after publicly stating that access to clean water is a luxury rather than a human right?

Of course.
i legit think Nestle is the devil
Unfortunately, this is not about water, but about zoning.  Nestle was not prevented from pumping water, only from building a booster pump station in a children's playground.  Yes, Nestle sued for the right to tear down a playground to build their pump station, and WON!  This was the appeal.  They could still go to the Michigan Supreme Court.
Good cause they are taking from public water supply that actually IS essential to public.  They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to take public water for free and sell it.
See them for what they are: A producer of plastic bottles.
One of the most evil corporations out there.
They own over 2k brands apparently. We should all avoid buying their products as much as possible and convince others to do the same

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands?wprov=sfti1
So as per Nestle water isn't a basic human right but it is an essential public service. #boycottnestle ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In Australia, every time a company did something shitty, a crazy rich dude would make a knock-off (copy, replica, etc) of a product to compete. Everyone would buy the knock-off, tank profits of the greedy corporation until they fixed their problem. The guy is called Dick Smith, so literally products were called Dicks, he made canned food when a manufacturer sneakily used overseas vegetables and our Aussie farmers were left with vegetables but not able to sell them. He made his own Tim Tams. They weren't as good, but it was a big fuck-you to selling more of the company overseas and sending more profits overseas. Feel free to copy this, it's worked really well for Dick (some stores called 'dick smiths' were originally owned by him, sold, many years later no longer related to him, those stores closed. He's still super $$$$$).
Nestle is one of the worst companies to exist. 

They result in more human deaths, more climate issues, and more community destruction than almost any other company. 

They should not exist. The government should revoke their corporate charter for gross mismanagement of Human life and affairs.
This is exactly what were fighting against here in Florida with Nestle.
Monsanto, Comcast, Sprint, EA, and United Airlines all just called.

They think Nestle is an asshole.
Bottled water companies don‚Äôt produce water, they produce plastic bottles.
"[Nestl√©] extracting water and sending it to other places where it cannot return to the water table, and, critically, doing so faster than the aquifer can replenish, is an ‚Äòirretrievable‚Äô depletion unless the pumping is reduced or halted,‚Äù 

Question, why are citizens told to conserve water in certain areas and when it comes to littering that's a fine if caught, but when it comes to corporations it seems like they can do whatever they want to the environment. I don't do it, but me dumping my waste oil from an oil change is far less damaging to the environment than PennDot applying oil to the roads or some corporation draining their waste. If anything, it's the corporations who are far more damaging to the environment than the people.
Bill Burr on Nestle:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pb6r8VNWk
Good. 
*fuck* Nestle. Was it not their CEO claiming that *he* should have more rights over water than residents living in the state where their bottling facility happens to be located?
*The court of appeals ruling is a victory for Osceola township, a small mid-Michigan town that blocked Nestl√© from building a pumping station that doesn‚Äôt comply with its zoning laws. But the case could also throw a wrench in Nestl√©‚Äôs attempts to privatize water around the country.* Yes üëè
This won't stop them. They'll keep trying. Different angles, different judges, different laws...
Nestl√© is so big that impossible to properly hit it hard with boycotts that could stop it from doing things like this.
Boycott Nestle for life!
My uncle was telling me how bottled water didn't even exist until the 80s or something. Crazy to think that they're now the norm and create so much pollution.
I‚Äôm glad that a tiny town in my home state blocked Nestle from building a water bottling plant as well as attempting to have access to their spring water. Almost everyone voted no and the mayor basically told them ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù. Take that, Nestle!

Nestle pure life water bottles are the worst tasting water I ever had.
Fun fact: most bottled water comes from a public source. This isn‚Äôt true of nestle of course, but a lot of the generic brands just buy water from a public utility and sell it to you at a higher price.

Drink your tap water, folks. If you need portable water, just buy your own plastic container and fill it from your tap.

Prepackaged bottled water just sends more garbage to the landfill.
They're fucking stealing water through loopholes pleas rope them in please
Water is going to be the new gold. Water rights getting snatched up all over the world.

There‚Äôs a documentary about the damage Nestle has done to the world. I can‚Äôt remember title but it was both fascinating and horrifying
Ok so which soulless scumbag let them claim that in the first place.
Funny how the company that says access to clean water is not a basic human right says that their own access is an essential public service.
The state legislators gave it the go ahead before the suit ... someone ought to look into who in the legislative body is on the Nestle payroll.
They should have a special water source tax that makes them pay 60% of profits back to the state for improving water treatment and supply.
Please boycott Nestle you guys. I know they make everything, but it can be done. 

Fuck any company that tries to profit off natural disasters and water, which ought to be a human right, not only a right, but necessity.
A very important aspect of the plot to privatize natural water supplies, is that

They (big money) will be successful in forcing bottled water to become "essential" when their political payees (Congress, EPA) allow those natural sources to become too polluted, and the water infrastructure too decrepit, to port potable water.

https://www.fluencecorp.com/what-is-potable-water/
This has some wide ranging implications for a huge number of industries.  Groundwater is used for all kinds of industrial processes.  From cooling water for boilers to water that winds up as an ingredient in your favorite brand of tomato soup or window cleaner.  It is not unusual for individual industries withdraw millions or billions of gallons of groundwater per year which results in revenue for the company.  None of that water is being replaced into the local aquifer.  It's really no different than sticking it in a bottle and selling it.  If this legal precedent is applied broadly, it could have a chilling effect on industry.
I don‚Äôt need bottled water though...

If I need to store water for emergencies, I can just fill up some containers with filtered water and leave it at that. I don‚Äôt need plastic bottles to store water. 

Crazy, I know!
I wish boycotting this company was easier.
Bottled water is a unneeded industry and a huge environmental disaster in both the way it depletes water sources and in waste production.
People who drink bottled water, when it's not a necessity in your area are morons.
I live in the area this is taking place. The actual plant is about 30 minutes from me and I work in Evart. People are saying that the river and local creeks are changing drastically because of the water supply being depleted so quickly.

Evart is a small factory town on U.S. 10 that cuts across Michigan. Most people have well water in the area because its so rural unless you live in town. Only reason anyone drinks bottled water here is if they work in a factory and they bring it in their lunch.

 Yeah, Ice Mountain in Stanwood creates jobs in our area, but you couldn't pay me to work for Nestle. Its all seasonal work, and they don't keep anyone for more than 90 days to avoid giving them benefits. If you do make it past the 90 days, its because you know someone and they got you the job so you can stay.
One of the hardest things in my day to day is checking every product I buy to make sure it‚Äôs not owned by Nestle. 

Fuck Nestle and people need to stop buying their products.
"Mr. Judge, the people can't live without bottled water, this should be obvious!"

"How did people survived 30 years ago then, sir?"

"They had Coca Cola, then sir."
Bottled water is cheap, marketing, bullshit, not essential public service. Outside of certain disaster zones, no one *needs* bottled water, it's a convenience. People can generally get along just fine without it.
This greedy company and their managers makes my blood boil...
Nestl√© is a plastic bottle company so they are actually a public hazard
Even if it was an "essential public service", nothing that is necessary for life should be privatized. That leads to profit > life. So if it was essential, that should be an even stronger case against allowing them to privatize the resource
They should really watch Tank Girl. Because if the y succeed in taking control of public water supplies, (which, have no doubt, is their goal,) it's going to end the same way: Death.

You start holding 'needed for life' elements for hostage, and people will kill for it. They will kill the employees at the plants, destroy the plant through whatever means necessary.

You're dealing with the most heavily armed citizenry in the world. We're already close to the tipping point where life necessities are going to become in shorter supply.

Nestle is just one of the companies that has seen this, and is positioning themselves to be in control of the most vital resource there is to mankind.

Big Ag is next, followed by Pharma. It's not wild conspiracy. It simple science. Resources are indeed finite, and the most vital ones are going to shrink at an alarming rate due to climate change. If companies like Nestle are not stopped now, the world's going to wake-up one day to a reality there may be no coming back from.
Nestle is really a shady company. A few years back I was an assistant investigator on an international research study for the efficacy of eating breakfast. While applying for grants, Nestle reached out to us with an offer to fully fund the study and even give compensation to our researchers. The only catch was that they got to design the bones of the study. 

Basically what they came up with was a study that would not only prove that breakfast was an absolutely essential part of your day, but oddly enough the caloric values and macronutrient spreads they wanted us to use matched almost *exactly* to their new line of frozen breakfast meals. 

We politely declined their offer.
Unpopular opinion: Nestl√© has indirectly lead to more human suffering and death in the last 30 years than the Chinese government.

In my home state back in the 90‚Äôs Nestl√© attempted to buy a water reservoir but was unable to do so because a tribal land owned it. Nestl√© bought the land next to it, tunneled into the water and slowly siphoned it away. The tribe, without any water source, asked the government for help but was told what Nestl√© was doing wasn‚Äôt even illegal (at the time).

Also, any chocolate that you eat from Nestl√© likely came from a cocoa bean that was harvested by someone under the age of 12 years old in west Africa. Absolutely horrendous that we let these people get away with it. It is assumed over the last 30 years over 60,000 underage workers have been exploited in the harvesting of cocoa Africa.
Last time I checked we already pay our government with our taxes for clean water
When a private company successfully replaces a critical commodity with its product, it usually ends up with plants craving electrolytes.
There‚Äôs a great documentary on bottle water and how awful Nestle is in the Netflix documentary series, Rotten in a Season 2. Really eye-opening to how detrimental bottles water is as an industry and how conniving Nestle is.
Corporations brilliantly created many key concepts and supported environmentalism to put the burden on the consumer.
God, Nestle is such a shit company
They sell water, soon enough they'll sell air
They sell dirt, and no one even cares
Someday, someone will buy the whole fucking moon
And then charge to change the tides and you will pay
Came to the comments for the Nestle hate. Stayed for the family recipes.
Can you imagine if private companies can just take public water from anywhere and resell it?

Nestle would build plants everywhere to divert public water into their plants and privately sell it. They'd hold water hostage, monopolize it to sell at a premium.
Damnit...but i love chocolate. Can companies just stop being steamy piles of shit so i can get my fat person on? Please?
Don't buy bottled water, but if you *have to*, don't buy Nestl√© brands (US brands bolded):

**Acqua Panna**, Al Manhal, Ala√ßam, **Arrowhead**, Baraka, Buxton, Cachatun, Charmoise, Ciego Montero, Contrex, Cristalp, Da Shan YuNan Spring, Deep Spring, **Deer Park**, Eco de los Andes, Erikli, Gerber, Ghadeer, Glaciar, Henniez, H√©par, **Ice Mountain**, Korpi, La Vie, Levissima, Manantial, Min√©r√©, Montclair, Naleczowianka, **Nestl√© Pure Life**,  Nestl√© Vera, **Ozarka, Perrier, Poland Spring,** Porvenir,  Pulmuone Saemmul by Nature, Reni, Santa Barbara, **San Pellegrino**, Sohat, Springs, Sta. Maria, Theodora, Valvert, Viladrau, **Vittel**, Waterman and **Zephyrhills**.  

They're pulling this shit all over the world. Water for free, cheap plastic packaging, pollution costs get put on society, they keep the mega profits. Some these waters brag about being sourced in National Parks and "protected areas." Obviously not protected enough.
Fucking piece of shit company!
Awesome! We are beating the plastic bags back a bit, it's time to go after the water bottles hard!
You know, I‚Äôm starting to think this nestle company isn‚Äôt good people.
About time the courts are giving a ruling against Nestle. Corporations must understand the long term consequences of their actions and corporations should be held responsible.
Wish we had the same amount of public outrage everyone had for some video game micro transactions, for Nestl√© a company literally committing crimes against humanity
As far as piece of shit corporations go, Nestle is pretty damn near the top of the list, if not on top.
For decades this company has pulled crap like this, they should be the next Bond villain.
This world is full of horrors.   No one in power cares about the earth.   Children get pawned off as slaves, children create clothes for adults and children.   Epstein didn't kill himself.    Billionaires are fucking and prostituting children.   Nestle is draining the water dry.  Using Slavery and paying dog shit for wages.    

There are more poor / middle class then millionaires billionaires.  We need to rise up.  Fuck this shit

This world needs a hero.
Nestle is Brawndo from Idiocracy
Good now get the fuck out of my hometown, or we can tax them reasonably
Nestle sells plastic bottles, they get the water for free
the fact that company like nestle hasn't been completely overturned is ridiculous. They should be cut down to 1/10th of what they are now with a completely new board staff
Thank fuck. Bottled water is the biggest con, and yet schmucks keep buying it!
Thank God there are some judges with brains out there. Screw Nestle.
Besides the greed of Nestle what about the lower court's ruling [bottling water was an ‚Äúessential public service‚Äù]???
Seems a little suspicious comradery between the lower court and Nestle.
Fuck Nestl√©. Fuck CCP.
If the water was 

1. Free and equal to all citizens during times of need or emergency

2. Used responsibly or from properly managed sources while compensating land owners

3. Not in a cheap plastic container with an expiry date and instead in a non perishable survival ration format

Then we'll talk
Where are the Twitter fucks at? They boycott anything & everything without a good reason but whenever there's a good reason to do so, they all fuck off somewhere. C'mon y'all, fuckin boycott em!
Thank fucking god.

I‚Äôm sick of being told to conserve a few cups of water in my house everyday, when Nestle is pumping out 400 gallons a minute.
Pumping an aquifer dry for profits, that has to be the American dream people are talking about.
Nestle can have all the Flint water they want, and hope the CEO drinks a gallon of it
It seriously messes with me that your judges are elected in a heap of places in the US. Even your court nominations are hyper political! I'm actually shocked to see such a sensable outcome.
Why are they taking fresh water? They want to bottle water and make money off it? They can open a desalination plant and bottle water for the rest of time.
Finally. A guilty verdict on the one percenters.
Essential public services are usually specifically defined to address things like electrical substations, power lines, and other pubic and quasi-public utility infrastructure.  for that circuit court judge to say that a privately-owned and privately used pumping station is an essential public service is preposterous.  I am glad they reversed this.
Water is essential, Nestl√© is not.
It's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to make money.

Came for this comment. They don't think water should be a public right. Why should they consider it an essential public service?

They really are.
They are and what's amazing is coke enjoys a fairly decent reputation and they're like nestle plus the added benefit of giving all the customers diabetes.

astonishing.
They are. Many in Michigan won‚Äôt drink nestle because they profit off our water.
I live in Canada where tap water is safe to drink and drinking bottled water is considered wasteful.  But when I was backpacking in Southeast Asia where you can‚Äôt drink tap water the bottled water was the only thing you can drink, and a lot of the brands there were nestles subsidiary. 

Not really sure where I‚Äôm going with this but sometimes there‚Äôs more to it
Nestle isn't the devil, our current economic system is. If a corporation can make money doing something evil, they're basically obligated to. They have a duty to earn as much money as they possibly can for their shareholders, even if it costs lives.

There are so many examples of companies killing for profit:

‚ñ™Bayer found out that their medicine was contaminated with HIV, but they didn't want to lose profits by throwing it away. They sold it overseas and infected tens of thousands of people with HIV. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products)

‚ñ™Pretty much every other pharmaceutical or medical company.

‚ñ™Big tobacco companies lying about health risks.

Edit: [the workers' rights movement in the US has been incredibly bloody,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes) many people have no idea how violent it's been and most people don't even know [all the benefits that labor activism has gotten us.](https://i.redd.it/7xznd5txrh041.jpg)
Nestl√© and Coca Cola both. Pure evil.
this needs to be higher, much higher
What the fuck man...
Move this up to the top. I wish everyone else's take was accurate but... Reality bites.
Nestle tried to set up a well and full production scheme in the local woods at my hometown. This was straight up in many peoples' back yard, and there was a constant noise of machinery and trucks driving in and out that completely changed the quiet vibe the neighborhood has always had. I could watch the trucks from inside my house. They felled hundreds of trees along what used to be a beautiful natural hiking path - the original landscape is no longer recognizable. Furthermore this meant more local traffic in town but mostly a whole lot of trucks, which congested traffic a lot. The town infrastructure want set up for that (it's a historical district, and the city planning reflects that). The biggest concern, though, was the inevitable effect on local ecosystem, foliage,  and water sources. The town lobbied for months against Nestle's sudden and quiet moves to take action setting up their camp, which was done without approval or even awareness by most people in town (imagine the confusion of having trucks felling trees and destroying the woods behind your house with no idea of why it's happening). Nestle ignored the local complaints for months, but eventually they did put the project on either pause or cancel (the trucks have stopped, at least for now). But our woods is ruined, people feel they have been violated, and therr will likely inevitably be a well there now one way or another.
Free? Come now, let's not be hyperbolic.  

I may be a little off on the metrics here, but I believe they pay the cost of 1 consumer priced bottle for every 5 minutes-of-Mississippi-flow's worth of water.  

It's a coupon level bargain, I gotta say.
THERE IT IS!!!!!!!! We consume so much micro plastic in general, but ESPECIALLY that leeched from plastic bottles, which are not economic, cleaner, or better for the environment in any way, shape, or form. The VSCO girls are really onto something with their trendy hydroflasks
I refuse to buy anything with the nestle name on it. It‚Äôs my way of voicing my opinion on their business tactics. Fuck nestle
This is bog standard for corporations.

When your only goal is profit, morality goes out the window.
the most evil are the ones that are the worst but visibily are the best or good looking.

Nestl√© looks like a mid tier in this topic

Edit: Like a ‚ÄúPill of Joy‚Äù Effect (from  ‚ÄúWe Happy Few‚Äù  games intro/prologue, as a comparation)
We should, but consumer protest against a company that owns such a large market share of diverse products will not work. Legislation is how you fix corps, short of sharp implements.
KitKat is on that list
There's an app called Buycott that helps with not buying Nestle brands.
You know how happy it makes me to go through that list and say I don't buy any of those products...fuck Nestle.
I grew up in the '80's without Oreo's - we got Hydrox(?) instead.  Same thing, really, in fact I think that Oreo copied them.  Regardless, when I asked about it, my dad cited Nestle as the reason why our purchasing choices where what they were.

As an adult with kids, we generally don't ever buy Oreo's and I'm mindful of our purchasing decisions.

Oh, but we do but bottled water.  The catch is that we buy the store brand (Kroger) and we don't buy, "spring water." We get purified water, "from a municipal source."  Once upon a time I wrote Kroger, asking where it came from.  They wrote back starting that it goes through an extra layer of purification but originates from Philadelphia's public water system - so I imagine that they're paying for it.

Yeah I hope there is something we can take from this lawsuit to save the Santa Fe and Ginnie springs. I know a lot of their lawsuit had to do with a children's campground but there are comparable protected lands and natural features being destroyed by nestle.
Good luck with that down there. Maybe when a sinkhole swallows some important people's house's they'll start to give a shit.
I can‚Äôt believe they just gave Ginnie springs to them. Like wtf

I don‚Äôt even know what to do.
I work with a project that tracks the turtle populations in the santa fe river basin. We have the most diverse turtle species on this side of the world. Our populations are decreasing massively between this and pollution. So many knowledgeable people are trying to fight it but its not enough. Our turtles are dying and migrating to other locations and there's nothing we can do
Wait what did sprint do?

I was a kid in the 80s. There was no bottled water. We rode our bikes all over town and when we got thirsty we just stopped at random people‚Äôs houses and drank from the outside faucet. I can‚Äôt see kids today doing that.
Dasani taste worse in my humble opinion.
The tap water where I‚Äôm at is extremely hard and tastes funny. I had to get a filter on my shower head because it was causing my skin to like fall off. I use a Brita filter and the water tastes, smells, and digests just fine. But still, not all tap water is created equal. I go to my moms and the tap water is wonderful, same at my dads. They both live in mountain communities where as I‚Äôm currently stuck in a shitty desert on the border of Mexico.
This was the plot of James Bond - Quantum of Solace
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an unpopular opinion
That's not all they do in Africa. They give women about 7 days of canned baby formula, just long enough that women stop producing milk. At this point you have no choice but to buy the formula. They are making infant deaths work wide.
So you‚Äôre saying nestle is mr burns
Michigan might be one of the few places that's true, with the multi-year lead contamination of the tap water in Flint.
fUCK my neighbor who keeps playing loud rap at 3:30AM and smash doors and scream on his fucking shit phone all night
I mean, I will do what I can, but when companies can get away with this crap? We've already lost before we've even started...

Edit: I'm just glad I'm not the only one that feels this way.
As a former Poland spring driver. I'll let you know that it is more like 600-700 a minute. And some springs have 2 pumps for 2 trucks to fill at the same time. I felt pretty guilty going to my home town to take water away and then on the flip side drive that water to Mass to get bottled. Hence why I'm a former tanker driver.
One of the biggest lies ever sold to the world was that the individual can have a huge impact on the way our resources are being used and our ecosystem is being polluted.  Yes technically we can...but corporations do far more damage far faster than individuals ever could.  


We need to hold the companies responsible just as much if not even more than individuals.
And make a profit off of it. That's a huge difference.
Forgive my ignorance, but what is the conserve a few cups of waters each day thing about? I've never heard that before, granted I live on the Ohio river where we get our tap water from and never have to worry about it running out.
I stopped caring about "zero waste" so much when I saw that the cleaners at a company I worked for emptied the bins every day regardless of how much was in them. That's at least 260 large plastic bags a year per bin, with 3 bins in one room.

I doubt the room I worked was the only place that did it, so it kind of feels pointless going out of my way to reduce my usage when I'm up against that.

I still reduce where I can, but not if it costs more than alternatives.
I‚Äôm not a fan of nestle and i think they engage in bad behavior but i do feel compelled to defend their water extraction in Michigan.  According to this government document, bottled water in Michigan, from all companies, not just nestle, accounts for 0.01% of total ground water extraction.   

Also, there are more than 80 companies that extract more water in Michigan than nestle.   Why not hate these other companies?  

https://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/Water_Use_Statistics_557539_7.pdf

I think it‚Äôs appropriate to hate nestle for their business practices in general, but pumping water in Michigan shouldn‚Äôt be one of them.  

They chose to shut down a nearby well because the water table rose so high it came into contact with contaminated soil.  Literally this part of the state has a problem with too much ground water.  

Furthermore, nestle pays exactly the same amount for water as you or I or any other entity in the state.   Zero dollars, because the state is not allowed to tax or sell ground water.   

I am not a fan of nestle but I find it inappropriate to spread lies and misinformation.

*edit* grammar.
Don't a lot of redditors save plenty of water due to not bathing regularly?
Except they are a foreign company which makes it the Swiss dream.
Nestle is a Swiss company...
That's the dwarven dream
Isn‚Äôt the water perfectly fine it‚Äôs just when that water contacts flints old pipes it causes the lead to come off? So if nestle pumped from the same source as long as they had different pipes they would have fine water.
Flint's issue with water isn't scarcity and bottled water has been a lifeline for them..
That would cut into quarterly profits.
This one right here, corporate overlord, sir.
I dont think anyone period doesnt think access to clean water is a human necessity. There are only people who say that because they dont care about people.
Agreed. I live where there is no shortage of water. But I lived in a house that had a shallow well. The water was very hard. It was terrible as you could not drink it and it had this smell.

It taught me how important clean water is. I know that's nothing like the people who have none. But   I understand on a level.

Edit: word
These people think that if you don't have access to clean water it's your own fault.
If corporations are "People" why don't we charge them with conspiracy to commit murder and murder?
Friendly reminder that the US government [OPENLY threatened African countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/health/world-health-breastfeeding-ecuador-trump.html) if any of them would help put a bill forward in the World Health Origination to promote breastfeeding, as this would cut into Nestl√© profits.

THAT is the government of the US's real face.
Child slavery anyone? 


https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/
I live in Turkey and my mother told me about how at one point when she was a teenager doctors and public figures were trying to tell people that breastfeeding was harmful to babies and they should use formula instead. I think this sort of marketing is one of the main reasons that that generation of people are significantly shorter and look less healthy on general then the people who came later.
Omg this *still* happens. My SO and I had jokingly developed a conspiracy theory about this when my first kid was born. Not only do they get infants hooked but they hook them on the expensive formulas while the baby is in the hospital so that the parents *have* to stick with that stuff or struggle to switch.


The nurses brought me some *top shelf* formula even after I emphatically refused it. Everyday they brought it even though my kid was latching and feeding perfectly. They sent us home with like 8 bottles of the stuff and some formula coupons from Nestle which I promptly gave away. The nurses were ecstatic about me choosing to breastfeed and seemed like offering formula was something they *had* to do not something they wanted to do.
It's great that we call them for what they are, but corporations are not evil, the people who manage them are evil, who planned this? Who approved it? Who got the benefits? THESE are then names we need to expose
I brought this up to my stepdad when he worked for nestle and he told me not to believe everything I read on the internet


????
nestle plus latin american violent cou'p/repression. entire unions have been slaughtered down there for coca cola profit motives
As far as the product itself goes, I have never seen Coca Cola claim that Coke is nutritious or essential to life. (can't really speak to their behavior as a company though)
What's more astonishing is how quickly people forget things. During WW2 Coca-Cola was banned from shipping its syrup to the Nazi's, so it invented a fruit-based syrup to bypass it and Fanta was born. Cocacola being the official drink of the allies and Fanta being the drink of the nazi's.   


Despite playing both sides, both drinks still have amazing success. 

We often focus on weapon dealers profiting from war & try to get them prosecuted but these companies seem to get a free pass.   


And this is far from the only example...
It's funny that you should mention it because the sugary drinks are engineered to be addictive all the while knowing the negative health effects of their product. Essentially Coke and Pepsi are drug dealers.
i'm from Slovenia (central Europe), where access to water is a **constitutional** right. If you go to a bar and request only water, they by law cannot deny your request. And i have no doubt that horrible shit like what nestle is doing contributed to this political action.

you don't have to go anywhere, it's a nice fun fact!
Non-Flint Michigander, the amount of times I have gotten sick from habitually chugging tap water in other countries is absurd. I could not fathom being forced to abstain from drinking my house's water supply. It really is sad.
oh, i 100% agree capitalism is the main source of these things happening. But i can also say that it takes disgusting morally corrupt people in charge to disregard human life and actively destroy and poison it.
>  If a corporation can make money doing something evil, they're basically obligated to. They have a duty to earn as much money as they possibly can for their shareholders, even if it costs lives.

This isn't true anywhere in the world. They have an obligation to make money for their shareholders but no one is legally obligated to sacrifice lives for profit, they just have a monetary incentive to.
You could say that Nestle is the devil, but capitalism is the hell the devils are in.
Sounds like you should elect a new local council and kick out the ones that zoned and approved the project.
That's when you mount a guerilla resistance to sabotage the well and drive Nestle out

Fuck your city government, they are destroying that which cannot be replaced
Incredible. This makes me feel sick...
Sounds like your town should sue them for destroying part of it.
I'd go fuck up the pumps if that happened to me
They actually pay a flat rate contract with several Michigan municipalities to pump from the Great Lakes aquifers with no limitation.
In Maine, they're pulling 19,000,000 gallons a month from our springs and reservoirs for $12,000.  That's $1.00 per 1,500 gallons. And all three of our state's Public Utilities Commissioners that approved the deal used to represent Nestle as attornies and lobbyists while working as lawyers for Pierce-Atwood and Wright Pierce.
Realistically speaking? 

In practice quite a few towns are pretty keen to have a bottling plant. A lot of such towns haven't got much in the way of local jobs and a few hundred jobs at a bottling plant can bring in a hell of a lot of money to a small town. 

Many such places don't have any particular water shortage so from the point of view of a mayor or similar it's an easy net win. Sell something they have copious supply of locally to get what's in painfully short supply. 

The rate they actually charge per acre-foot of water is often only really symbolic because what they really care about is the local jobs that bring in vastly more to the local finances.
Did the math on Nestle's mark-up on water extracted from British Columbia.  100,000,000%.
Not in California they don't..

In Strawberry Creek they are pulling million of gallons of water per year but they only pay a tiny access fee of $524 annually.

Same. Too bad they own everything that isn't labeled Nestle also.
If you're interested in doing a wider boycott than just the flagship Nestl√© brand, [here are the companies that are owned by Nestl√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)
Is there an anti Nestle Reddit? This is something we could really easily disrupt. I was thristy today, forgot my water bottle, didn't buy water while shopping. Very proud of myself. Will remember bottle in future.
[Here](https://www.indybay.org/uploads/2018/01/28/nestle2.jpg) are the products you need to avoid in order not to finance Nestl√©. I try to avoid them as well.
I share that info with anyone who will listen. Since the only thing they care about is money, it's the only thing that will stop this.
Same here. I wish Coffee Crisp wasn‚Äôt so bloody delicious, but the boycott is worth it.
"Cries in Germany" where nestle is involved in almost every all day grocerie we have.........
Same. That‚Äôs why I only drink from Poland Spring...*looks at bottle‚Äôs minor print * ‚ÄúPoland Spring a nestle company *

Dammit!

In all seriousness we need to get a handle on how to boycott these companies properly. 

I could think I‚Äôm not buying from nestle only to move on to a ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù only to realize Coke owns Sprite.
We've tried legislation, but they captured the regulators. 

I say we try the sharp implements & light producing sticks ~~in mass~~ "en masse"!
Legislation will not work when they own the legislature.
Yes, but in the US KitKat is made by Hershey. Nestle makes it outside of the US.

That is how Capitalism and Free Markets are _supposed_ to work. Too often they don't because of regulatory capture and rent seeking.

I love Capitalism but I despise what we have in the US right now.
Does Nestle even pay taxes? I assume they avoid like most other big conglomerates.

The greatest trick that's happening right now is the convincing of the general public that we have to do all the cutting to save the environment, while corporations are polluting and harvesting resources at insane rates.  

You're totally correct.   I'm not saying each person shouldn't try to help where they can... but like the dude says, we can all cut back a few cups a day, but when a corporation is legally allowed to steal so much... what's the point.  

I'm at the age where I should be having a kid... but most of my brain is telling me the world will be total shit in 50 years so why bother.  I'd just be signing him/her up for a life of strife and pain.  Seems like a dick move just so I can have someone to teach video games to, share christmas' and family recipes with.
We lost when we allowed them to declare corporations are people and money is free speech.
Defeatism is exactly what Nestle wants you to feel. Well, defeatism and thirst for water that comes in disposable containers that litter the earth for all eternity.
Lol even if every single person on earth cut back, it wouldn't make up for a *single* company like Nestle or Coca-Cola. And they're only the beginning.
There is no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism. Doing what you can will never change anything.
For a second there I was thinking to myself how a former springboard diver was so knowledgeable about this topic
What I don't understand is why Nestle feels the need to fight over this particular water. They aren't using it near there, they are shipping it far and wide. They could ship it far and wide from just about anywhere. Is there no other source of water in 10 states?
Go get a shovel and try to strip mine a mountain for coal,  then think about the companies that level moutains plural
Consumer behavior really does drive corporate behavior. If consumers weren't consuming so much bottled water the corporations wouldn't be producing it.

I still support the courts' regulation in this case, just saying, consumer behavior really is the fundamental factor.
If you live in a place where your water is supplied by groundwater, the water is replenished much less quickly than if you rely on a river (or Lake, I live where we rely on Lake Erie for water). In some places, we are drawing water from the groundwater more quickly than it gets replenished and eventually the water will just run out. You can read about the Ogallala Aquifer for an example of this.
Its like the plastic straw ban, its meant to push the guilt on to you. Its your fault the sea creatures have plastic ring suffocating them. Not the corporations who actually make this stuff. Not the corporations that throw away a billion times more waste than you could ever make in a lifetime, they do ot in a day. But it's our fault for not doing enough.
When they say cups, I interpret it as this saying of "don't waste water by brushing your teeth with the tap running" "take showers instead of baths" and such
I'm still in the drought mindset in California, where people were not showering or bathing from buckets and letting all their plants die to conserve the tiniest bits of water, while rich people down south used up thousands of gallons to keep their massive non-native lawns green, and their unused pools filled.
Technicality. They have no *real* allegiance to a nation. They would just as happily devastate Switzerland if they could do do for profit.
Yep. And it wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't cut back on the cheap pipe treatment chemicals that would prevent the safe calcium cover in the lead piping from being removed when they switched over to the river water.

A stupidly short sided cost cutting measure ended up destroying the health of many lives, and ended up costed many, many orders of magnitude more anyway.
My friends and I caught the flint river on fire one time in college. I would not drink it.

The pipe issue is completely separate. They do not use the river as a water source at all because it is so polluted.
Not even. The pipes are fine as long as you add certain chemicals to prevent corrosion of the lead.
Too bad so sad. We need socialism for the masses and capitalism for corporations, not the other way around.
Bernie 2020
Yeah, and if people sincerely think that water isn't a human right, I hope they get dehydrated for 3 days
But I guarantee you there are people that will say "if you want water get a job and pay for it like the rest of us" without even a tinge of self-reflection.
They're only people when their lobbyists want them to be
I'll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one.
Because you just interpreted the law in a way that is detrimental to corporations. We don't do that here. Only if it's a positive to them.
[We do sometimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_convicted_of_felony_offenses_in_the_United_States) but it‚Äôs not really effective because it‚Äôs mainly the people behind the decisions that the court sees as liable
Because if they are people, they're part of the ruling class that gets the kid gloves legal system that protects them from their consequences. 

At worst, they get asked to pay a small cut of the profits from their illegal activities like a cost of doing business.
Because they are Feudal Lords, not serfs.
As my corporations professor would say, ‚ÄúCorporations aren‚Äôt people, they‚Äôre ‚Äúits.‚Äù ‚ÄúIts‚Äù don‚Äôt think, feel, or have opinions, and an ‚Äúit‚Äù can‚Äôt do anything on its own. It needs people to use it.‚Äù

And to that end, directors and officers (the people who operate the ‚Äúit‚Äù) have gone to prison for crimes committed while running the business. [Enron is the most famous example of that.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)

#`#fuckNestle`
Yup, that's a big issue with the corporate structure, they are legally people and get all the benefits, but don't have to go to jail and only ever really pay fines. It also brings psychopathic personalities to positions of leadership, but that's leadership in general, another debate society needs to have, but should start talking about first.
Someone should try to marry a corporation and then have the corporation attempt to abort an embryonic corporation its pregnant with.

You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-variate, multi-national dominion of dollars.

They're just job creators! /$
They're starting a baby friendly hospital iniatives to stop this. So certain hospitals are "baby friendly". However some women have reported the opposite problem at these hospitals. They couldn't produce enough milk or a proper latch and asked for formula. Or they weren't comfortable breast feeding. And hospitals wouldn't comply. I definitely agree they should encourage breastfeeding but they also need to do what's best for baby and mom's health. If mom doesn't want to breastfeed(for example it can be extremely painful for some women) it's not healthy to force her too. Hopefully hospitals are fine tuning the program . It's also bringing in a lot more lactation consultants to help mom's who are having trouble or need guidance.

Wait. Wait. Stop there. Some of us weren't alive during WW2. Hard to forget what you never knew
By "engineered to be addictive" you mean "contain sugar".

Like almost anything you might find at the supermarket.

Somewhere buried beneath all the hysteria, absurd accusations, and emotional appeals there is a valuable discussion to be had on the role of sugar in our foods. But this thread is a bit crazy.

Is your grandmother dealing drugs when she makes you snickerdoodles?
I always love seeing European countries where they have these laws.  So many countries have restaurants where they want to charge you 5+ Euros just to have anything to drink at all.
I mean around here its not a right, but who the fuck denies water to someone? People out of their mind thats who
For sure, but I think there are pretty much always going to be morally corrupt people. We shouldn't have a system that *rewards* that type of behavior.
Sure, and the disgusting, morally-corrupt people always rise to the top of any capitalist enterprise precisely because they get those profits that other's can't or won't.  And if there's no one in company A who will do it, then there's someone in company B who will, and company B will out-compete company A, buy it, and make even more profit.  That's not a flaw of capitalism.  It's a feature.
It's because the people at the top are sociopaths who lack empathy so they don't see it that way. People dying means literally nothing to them, it's as normal as tossing out a paper coffee cup when they've finished it.

And if they can make a few extra $$$ while that happens (because they think it's gonna happen anyways), might as well make a profit.
And launch an investigation to see if Nestle made some under the table agreements with local politicians. Our local governments must be held accountable, meaning fines and jail time for those accepting "gifts" from such companies.
How is this legal? 

There is the great lakes pact and my understanding is that you have to be allowed by the entire pact to draw from the aquifer

**Just read up on this. Nestle got approved for a permit to increase their water draw from 250 gallons to 400 gallons per minute. 

They actually haven't been able to draw 400 since this permit was approved. One to do the the zoning issue this appeal deals with. Also secondly there is an ongoing case around them drawing more water out than can be replinished and then shipping the water away from the great lakes water basin which ensures water can't be replenished.

Interesting case

Crazy thing that this town had to crowdfund legal fees to fight back against Nestle. Makes you see why they usually get their way
As required by our great lakes treaty with Canada. We aren't allowed to charge a rate for extraction. They just license a certain amount that they have found to be sustainable and you pay a licensing fee that supports the administration of the program.
Found out a few weeks ago they own those frozen Jack‚Äôs pizzas. Bummer. Bye bye Jack‚Äôs.

Surprised that I don't really use any of these products.  I live in San Antonio and the store we go to, HEB, has really good store brand stuff that I like.  Back when I lived in Kansas, it's surprising how much of this I *did* buy.
I'm actually doing pretty good, but god damn it, why the fuck do they own every frozen pizza brand? Maybe this is the wake-up call I needed.

I know right? And when is the last time you saw a corporation recycle something other than cardboard... if they even do that? I'm told I have to wash out all my plastics, tins, glass, etc, sort them and put them out for recycling. Corporations just compact it all and send it all to the landfill in massive quantities.
The real question is; what's the corporate equivalent of a noose? Seizure of all assets, including, if possible, foreign ones? (Threat of war if company isn't turned over or dissolved and absorbed by local government?)

Firing squad for the board?

In fact, individual conservation efforts drive prices ever so slightly down, so that some person or firm that doesn‚Äôt care can just afford to use more.
As is evidenced by the dramatic drop in meat consumption and the availability of alternatives.
I would assume a good amount of bottled water is due to undrinkable/unpalatable tap. City water sucks ass and not everyone is willing to filter it and deal with it tasting weird.
Plastic straw bans I understand, there are millions of people living in cities and every day there are tons of plastic straws being used once and thrown out, so much of that plastic ends up in the oceans. Yeah a corporation might dump a ton of plastic into the ocean but even if we stop all the corporate pollution in one city like NY, you still have 10 million people every day working and living in the city and creating waste. It adds up, so you kind of need to regulate both.
This makes so much more sense. In my head I was imagining them filling up cups of water and putting them in the fridge in case their tap ran dry. Wow I feel dumb
That is why we have regulations that the US don't seem to have.
Short sighted
I have to wonder sometimes if the people in charge of these decisions, where cutting the budget for one thing causes much more expensive problems down the line, are ever forced into it? It seems to happen often enough that you'd expect people to put more effort into finding out where you can and can't cut the budget before those budget cuts have any kind of serious impact, but instead of that it feels like people make cuts to whatever seems too expensive and hope it isn't too important. We have enough historical knowledge and experience to nip many problems in the bud, and instead it feels like some force (either coerced, malevolent, or just plain idiotic) is making the same mistake over and over.

BP didn't actually get charged with manslaughter, it was 2 executives (the charges were dropped as well but that's a different story).
Except when it happens to be rich assholes hiring undocumented immigrants and working them in unsafe ways, and paying them shit wages and then when they get caught, it's never the people who run the company who hired them who gets in trouble, it's the poor people looking for a better life.
The reckless bankers behind the economic crash in 2008 were thousands of time more detrimental to society than every drug user/petty non-violent criminal currently serving time combined.
That's exactly what happens.
They're "its" except when it comes to politics in which case they have protected free speech rights that allow them to give unlimited money to politicians. Republican supreme court is going to be the end of this country. Fucking ridiculous.

Yep.fed is best. Sick of people shaming mothers for using formula. Many babies get sick and die because the mother doesn't produce enough milk. And they keep trying breastfeed them because they're told that they are a failure of a mother if they use formula. But fuck nestle. Never get formula from them.
12 months!? That's great... Most peers I know quit after 1-2 months

you haven't heard about the fanta chambers?
Ya, I mean soft drinks aren't intrinsically evil. 

If a baker sells bread to north korean citizens that doesn't make him guilty of any of the crimes of the regime.
War profiteering and the rules governing dealing with the enemies of the state are almost never enforced.  IBM created computers to track the Jews (that‚Äôs what the numbers tattooed on them were for) and nothing happened to them.  Henry Ford was an open Nazi supporter and I believe he manufactured vehicles for them and nothing happened to him.  I believe both Exxon and BP provided oil to the Nazis, and they both continue on.  This was long ago but shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten bc there are companies still doing this today with our ‚Äúenemies‚Äù.
Except it's much easier to fight a war while your enemy is cut off from supplies.
In Australia, free and easy access to water is a requirement for anywhere that serves alcohol as part of their alcohol license. I'm not sure of this technically carries over to all restaurants, cafes, etc. as a legal requirement of they don't serve alcohol, but basically everywhere will serve tap water at 0 cost.
A lot of establishments in Europe absolutely will deny people water.
i agree. we need a system which serves the people (and by extension prevents abuse of power) instead of people serving the system, like it exists now.
They do the math.  They add up how much they need to spend in advertising to get news orgs to bury the story and get people to forget about the slaughter, subtract that from the expected profits, and if they're left with a positive number, they do it.
everything the nazis did was 'legal'

we need to stop pretending legality means anything.
Check out the [water war of Cochabamba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochabamba_Water_War) in Bolivia for an even more extreme example of this kind of bullshit. I don‚Äôt believe Nestle was involved or bottles, but similar idea. They tried to privatize the water utility, give a monopoly to a company that began hiking water rates. People protested and eventually won out. It was a big victory for common people as their government listened. 

Then a couple weeks ago their government was deposed in a military coup with the support of most US politicians, including many of our ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù

Thanks for letting me know!!

If you have Aldi near you, theirs are the same price or cheaper than Jack's, and a bit better.
Doesn't work if they own the government officials.
Boycotts work, just target businesses that sell their products and demand they stop selling them. 

People need to actually comitt to that though. For example If you go to your local delis and tell them to stop selling their products, and refuse to buy it from them...then they will stop ordering it...which hurts nestle. This needs a lot of people though to work though, get your community involved
Boycotting Nestle means you will buy more Unilever. I dont know if thats an improvement. All I can say is that I dont see the kind of news from Unilever that I see from Nestle.
There is nothing HEB brand that I have tried that isn't as good as name brand. Plus their bread is made fresh every day even on Sunday.
Heh Dr. Oetker is one of the more popular brands for frozen pizza in the Netherlands. Not owned by Nestl√©, whew. 

Wagner pizza is however.
If you are in America, American KitKats, and Rolo are made by Hershey, not Nestl√©
Make sure that other brand isn't also owned by Nestl√©.
Absolutely! We desperately need to get money out of politics and get rid of the legalized corruption.

This is a pretty easy recipe to make if you need a metric ton of fudge. :)
Like the one time someone SHOULD use an album on imgur.

For real tho this recipe looks amazing I'll add it to my collection of stuffing/dressing recipes.
Yeah I've... mildly considered it.  My only problem is the people I've seen adopt are living miserable lives.  The adopted kids are already damaged and warped... pretty much beyond repair.  They're punching holes in the walls, raging all day.  The parents I see are stressed all the time, organizing with probation officers, psychologists, other law enforcement.  Just so the kids can scream at them how much they hate them, then destroy some of their stuff.  All while they dump every once of effort and money they have into providing a great home for them.  

I can honestly say... I'm not sure how I could deal with that.  If it was my own flesh and blood I think I could take it... but when I know it's just trying to help someone out...  I don't know how much piss to the face I could take before I finally said "yeah alright man, you hate me so much why don't you just go back into the states care."

The guy in the cube next to me adopted... he had to leave work pretty regularly because the kid tells people he's going to murder them at camp.  Then gets mad when the camp says he can't come back and punches/smashes things in his house.  I just don't know how I could deal.  

It's not that attractive of an option from the few people I've seen that have tried it.
What are the top 5 polluting companies doing that wouldn't be reduced if people/consumers cut back on their consumption?
We then would have to decide to help those who didnt have a job other than to play, socialize,  create ideas, sleep and eat.  We are a consumer driven society and what makes the jobs.  Folks need to realize we are nearing a time when we do not need millions working anymore.  There will be jobs that computers and machines cant do but every decade less actual people are needed.  Can society come to terms with folks who do not work in the sense we do now and not think of them as lazy? If we cant change thousands of years of thinking..we just gonna hate.  When folks are relaxed and nothing to do we can be so creative!!!
In our world, right now, the Devil=the rich and powerful.
This [Time Magazine](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tim191202v1_elites.cover2_.jpg?quality=85&w=840) cover is sickening.

The elites are getting away with more than ever and laughing about it, not deflating.
I dont know where this quote is from, but it's at the beginning of a metal song I used to listen to all the time. Wish I could remember it now. Opeth? Behemoth? Maybe Deicide or Suffocation? Fuck, I haven't listened to Deicide in like 8 years... I'm just typing to myself at this point.
I'm in the same boat. But I also have 14-16 nieces and nephews and then I realize that I don't want any kids. The world's fucked and they're loud.
I've concluded for myself that when I want to be a parent I'm going to adopt for this same reason
This is the exact thing that stopped me from having a second child. My wife keeps pushing and refuses to accept that the world is shit and having another kid is NOT doing it justice.
Too bad we're severly hamstringing their ability to influence their own future. Power and influence is rapidly flowing at an alarming rate from citizens to corporations
Or like in China, they will be controllled completely.
No they won't.
The world is going to be fucked long before your kids have a chance to change anything.
Yeah, that's what previous generations said, and yet here we are.
If it makes you feel better, Albertsons company (grocery) has to recycle and compost everything possible. Plastics, cardboard, glass, it‚Äôs all sorted and recycled. And produce is composted.
Every day at the corp I work for?
Most of those sound great. Government seizing shares would just make them worthless though. The value of shares is based on demand for them. If they can no longer be traded because the government seized them there‚Äôs no market for them anymore.
More than that. Get involved in local government. Go to the meetings. Meet the people. Can't just sit back and hope your vote is going to change the world.
Ah god damn it this line of reasoning pisses me the fuck off when I see it in socialist circles. For example, how the fuck else are we going to create new, good meatless products to conserve land and forests if there's no fucking market base? Doing ethical things, coupled with pressure to regulate abuses coupled with removing subsidies can push many people into better categories. Making ethical choices is good when combined with ways to stop abuses.
>Plastic straw bans I understand, there are millions of people living in cities and every day there are tons of plastic straws being used once and thrown out, so much of that plastic ends up in the oceans

Your falling for the corporate propaganda.  

In North America the vast majority of single use straws are thrown in the trash, and properly landfilled.   

The plastic that is wrecking havok on our oceans is primarily from Asia, where local rivers are used as trash chutes.
You do need to regulate both, however corporations lobby against reform while citizens typically do not.

In business, you'll see people make short term cost cutting measures and getting out of dodge before the long term affects pop into existence, knowing full well what's coming down the line (alongside the standard incompetence brought on by the need to maximize for THIS quarter, fuck the next, b/c stocks and shareholders are the only important thing ever, obviously).

In government... IDK.
Are we talking corporations or churches? or maybe politicians.

'Murica!
And "speech" because money is free speech, especially for non-corporeal entities such as devils and multinational businesses.
They're money
One of those few and far between cases where China seems like a leader in corporate responsibility.
The various Secretaries of State (State level) can still administratively dissolve an entity or revoke their authority to do business.
Stop, I can only get so erect, non-ironically
We tried to break up AT&T only to have it re-form like a T1000.
Depends on whether you think the driving factor is a few bad apples^TM or greed in corporate culture
> the charges were dropped as well

Of course they were. Killing people is legal in practice if it's an administrative decision made by rich people to become even richer.
Even when it is them, the consequence isn‚Äôt significant enough to make them stop. That‚Äôs just the cost of doing business.
That's what capitalism is all about.  Everybody loves a winner.

if you look like a bum and try to get water from a very fancy place, then absolutely there will be some places that will deny you a cup of water.  
  
however most casual places, which populate any sizable town, city or village, will give you a cup or even have a jar of water and a few cups for self-service.
Yup, just like how the opoid crisis is killing people across the country in huge numbers, and the pharamacy companies get sued and instead of making 300 billion this year, they get fined for 100 billion and still make 200 profit. They would do it again in a heartbeat once the public outrage dies down.
I meant how did the pact allow this, ~~but I guess that they may not preside over things such as this which is concerning~~   An amount is calculated that should be replenishable and the state is allowed to license those amounts out  

I know when a town in Wisconsin wanted to be able to draw from the great lakes water basin they had to go through many many hoops with them to get approved
While I agree with your overall point, the Nazis actually did a lot of explicitly illegal things to gain and keep their power.
I used to work for these fuckers. They bought the company I worked for and cut my pay (straight commission) by 35% because I "didn't deserve to make that much". I doubled the volume of my territory in 3 years from when I got it and 2 years later we were sold to them. They wanted everyone in sales to be in the same $5k income window, regardless of what they had the opportunity, drive, and capability to do. I fucked up and stayed for 2 years and regret it to this day.

It is possible to adopt a baby.
As a kid who was good and just needed a home you would be suprise how little effort some need. You have the chance to heal and save someone.
This comment is dangerous in that it's promoting the idea that all kids in need of adoption who aren't babies are damaged goods that no one wants to deal with. There are a ton of kids who are older who don't have serious mental illness (besides the depression, anxiety and insecurity that probably comes from living the reality that no one wants you), and would thrive in a home with guardians who genuinely care about them.
This 100% depends on the age that the child was adopted.

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=20&q=child+outcome+age+adoption&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DvjoDMgbphsoJ

Most studies state an age range of 5-7 years as to when behavioural differences can be seen between adopted and biological children. Of course it all depends on the child's background, how long they were without a stable family,  whether they experiences trauma. 

It is very possible to get a child, not even a baby or toddler, but a 7 year old child that can be adopted without experiencing any more psychological issues than a biological child would.
Thank you. Reddit makes it seem like adopting is the most beautiful thing in the world, while you tell the truth in a way few people dare say.
That's just like 1 kid. Not all kids that are adopted are "damaged and warped beyond repair." That is just an insane thing to say. They are kids.
Lobbying the government to allow them to pollute at barely regulated levels while lying about the impact to make their customers think there isn‚Äôt a problem.  :\

For example, you use to be able to buy Coke in glass bottles and return them for a small refund.  It then became cheaper for Coke to bottle their products in disposable plastic bottles so they shifted over and made the claim it was better for the environment because they could be recycled.  Since then they‚Äôve actively lobbied against any efforts to improve recycling of plastics because it might require they be taxed directly (because of how many bottles they produce).

In addition, those ads that use to run on tv convincing you it was a moral failing on your part if you didn‚Äôt recycle - like the Native American crying on the side of the road - those were produced by corporations wanting to shift the blame for pollution off them and onto consumer.  They paint a picture that pollution is caused by evil people tossing trash out a car window, but plenty of times it‚Äôs trash cans blowing over in a storm, or a landfill getting washed away in a flood, or a company just dumping crap vs proper disposal.

Yes, people should consume WAY less - but you have a handful of massive corporations knowingly producing products that they know will harm the environment and then fighting against attempts to make them better and passing the blame to others, vs millions of consumers that likely don‚Äôt even realize the scale of their contributions. 

Hell, I work in IT and at my last job we sent all our old computers and stuff to a certified e-waste disposal company and assumed it was properly and responsibly handled.  Later came to find out all that stuff was shipped to China where it was likely burned in fires near drinking water supplies.  We switched to another recycling company that was the ONLY one in not just the state, but surrounding states, to actually dispose of stuff properly, but you can see how it‚Äôs easy to assume you‚Äôre doing the right thing when really you‚Äôre contributing to the problem without knowing.

Lastly, one of the things I say at work a lot is if you design a form that most people will fill out wrong then you need to change the form.  If you refuse and declare that your entire user base needs to read a stack of instructions and learn how to do it properly then you‚Äôre a bad admin.  Same thing applies to companies like Coke in my mind.  If you know your product won‚Äôt be disposed of properly, then make you should see what you can change to mitigate that.  If you refuse, then you might as well have thrown that plastic bottle in the lake yourself.
The top 5 companies are oil and coal companies.

Cutting back consumption helps, but much bigger gains could be made by different intermediate companies.

For example: your power company could decommission their old coal plant, and replace it with solar + storage.  Data centers could use a more energy efficient design that saves on air conditioning costs.  Car companies could sell you an electric car.
Same as it ever was
I mean since at least the 15th century where they orchestrated the genocide or forced labour of indigenous peoples, for the profit of the rich. Not to mention their ecocidal practices.
Telling people what they want to hear rather than uncomfortable truths.
It's the final line in the movie The Usual Suspects

https://youtu.be/4OAFtr-ciQE?t=485
they're so loud
Not to mention all the money belongs to greedy dickheads who "wOrKeD haRdEr" than all the rest of us.
While actively telling them conservativism is all it's forms is the only way to live.
And it's up to us to give them a chance.  We can't just sit idly by and say, "the kids will fix it".
Literally, " here you go kids, the world is fucked but I'm sure you can fix it right? :)"
I've worked with researchers and helped write software that tracked the flow of garbage through the ocean (they dumped a ton of pods in the ocean with GPS trackers, kind of like Dorothy from the movie Twister, and I helped write algorithms to model the movement of those devices) so I'm well aware of where the majority of plastic comes from. But dumping plastic straws into a landfill where it will sit for a few hundred years is not "proper disposal". Recycling straws doesn't help either since we'll just ship that waste over to Asia where they will dump it into the ocean since it's no longer financially viable to recycle.

I'm not saying governments and corporations bear no responsibility, I'm saying everyone does. Even if you just make a small change at the local level it can have large effects. For example, if everyone in NYC reduced their water usage by just 2 cups per day it would save close to 1.2 million gallons of water. Plus, doing something like banning plastic straws brings the issue to the forefront. I would rather see a ban on plastic water bottles below a certain size, there's no reason you need to create so much plastic waste to get a small amount of water when you could just as easily use a reusable bottle, plus the process of manufacturing so many individual water bottles wastes a ton of water. It's just that a ban on plastic straws is at least something that we can easily do right now to solve an obvious plastic waste generation issue.
That's absolutely true, but there's a huge financial incentive for a corporation to hire full time lobbyists, the general public doesn't typically have the time or resources to lobby in person for or against anything and it's hard to get enough people to do a letter campaign
Politicians are way less protected than both churches and corporations, that's why they put all their money in foundations, which are corporations with the same privileged status as churches.
Not just 'Murica, it's most of the world my country included.
We are talking about a Swiss corporation
If I want to spend my money on political advertisements, that‚Äôs my right under the first amendment. And that right doesn‚Äôt change just because I join a group.
Companies that have proven to be a detriment to society shouldn't exist, the real answer to that problem is they've had their chance and they've proven they can't contain their reckless greed so lets take away their ability to act on it by seizing the means of production.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even enough to punish a corporation for it, the whole system‚Äôs gotta go.

At an absolute minimum, the profit motive is outright and blatantly detrimental to humanity and cannot be allowed to exist.
Just like when HSBC got caught laundering, either 100s of millions of dollars or it was billions of dollars, drug cartel money.  They were fined something ridiculous like 3 million dollars, no one was removed from the board, no one was arrested.  It‚Äôs a cost of doing business.
It‚Äôs all about turning life into a zero sum game and then shitting on all the idiots who lost, nevermind that almost all of them didn‚Äôt have a chance from the start.

Also nevermind that a lot of otherwise very capable people wouldn‚Äôt thrive in a socially competitive system of this nature even if everyone really did get equal opportunity.
laws are there to keep you from hanging your lords, not to stop your lords from stealing your water.
Probably because of nestle, either nestle not wanting competition or because people were aware of what a fuck up it was to let nestle do it in the first place
Wait, Haagen Dazs is Nestle?

Digiorno was my guilty pleasure. From time to time, it's ok to get some shitty food. It helps boost dopamine, and make life a little more enjoyable, you know? I'm a fit guy. Abusing it is what's bad. And there actually are a lot of decent shitty food companies. For example for frozen pizzas, there definitely are legitimate companies in the game that are much more worthy of your dollars than Nestl√©. Supporting your local small businesses is the way to go, imo.

Get a pie pan, make a crust out of strips of croissant dough from a can. Brown some ground beef with onions, drain, and add a can of tomato sauce.

Adopting babies is significantly more expensive than adopting a child.

Almost nobody wants the children because of reasons the person above said.

They are usually severely damaged from being abused, neglected, being born drug addicted or having physical and mental problems because the mom abused drugs while they were in the womb, they have learning disorders or mental health issues, and/or they have been shuffled from group home to group home or foster home to foster home. They act out, they abuse themselves or others including pets, their first reaction is frustration or anger, they don't trust anyone, and so on.

It is pretty much a full time job caring for them and getting them the help they need. They may never be able to live a relatively normal and productive life and have healthy relationships.

Ok, so maybe I am being a Debbie Downer, but don't go into the situation with rose colored glasses and thinking everything is going to be rainbows and sunshine. Anyone who chooses to take the kids in, especially those who adopt more than one are absolute saviors and saints for the most part, though you do hear horror stories of some children being further abused and neglected by foster and adoptive parents.

I also have a ton of respect for the people who work in child services who interact with the children. I have an educational background in the field but I am extremely hesitant to change careers because I already know it is going to be a very stressful environment and I think I would get overwhelmed.  Just going through the classes is a real eye opener.
I work with troubled teens, even the kids that were adopted as babies have issues of abandonment that tend to come out in ways of self-harm and anger. But let's face it, all teenagers are scary no matter where they come from
Well, adopting is beautiful and a truly admirable thing for someone to do. But not all parents are prepared to handle a child who's been through an abusive childhood and rather than acting like it's a massive hardship or all negative you just need to know that it's not going to be as 'easy' as raising your own biological child from birth. (And even that isn't easy by a long stretch). Adopting and fostering are hard, dirty, stressful jobs and that's why it's wonderful when people choose to do it (and put in the right amount of effort and care into what they're doing)
The adoption process and results are the best argument for abortion in the entire world.
Where is your IT job and can I work there?
All of those things are already happening, and happening even faster than was expected even five years ago.

* Power generation from coal dropped by half in ten years from 2008-2018. Hundreds of plants have been closed, totaling 14.5 GW of generation capacity in 2018 alone. 
* Only one new coal plant has been opened in the US since 2015, and that was a 17MW plant at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and even that was controversial. It was chosen only because all other options were far more expensive.
*  Only one other coal plant is planned in the US, an expansion at the Holcomb plant in Kansas, and it's running out of time. Construction has to begin by March 2020 or the permit expires. Even the owner, Sunflower Electric Power Corp., doesn't seem to expect to start it because its customers have demanded other sources.
* Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and others typically run data centers much warmer than they used to, make increased use of ambient air where possible, and have for several years relied heavily on renewable energy, often using on-site solar and wind.
* Every car manufacturer is transitioning at least partly to electric vehicles. Several have committed to completely ending production of internal combustion vehicles by 2030.

You might be impatient about the rate of change, but for those of us a little older (I'm GenX), this is an amazingly fast change. It's not the rate we need to properly combat climate change, but by 2030, the US, and possibly the world, will be very different.

Was in an argument with one of these selfish pricks. He worked harder by being able to buy dirt cheap distressed properties in 2009 then retired on renting. He refused to admit that having gotten sick in his early 20s would have ended the business he is so proud of building.

I agree but what's wild is the people who defend it even in the most inhumane contexts - like if someone wants to argue for luxury items competition and profit motive being good I'll disagree and move on. However - someone arguing that the profit motive doesn't result in objectively evil outcomes when it comes to things people need: Housing, Healthcare, food etc. then they're out of their goddamn minds or they've been seeped in capitalist propaganda for so long it's nearly impossible for them to see reason.
The penalty should be whatever profits they got from the illegal activities and *then* the fine on top.

Often apologists turn up and shout "but that would bankrupt the company! It could never survive that!". To that I say; *yes, so what?*

Can you imagine that people actually defend companies that make so much of its income by criminal activities that it couldn't survive without it? Then why the hell should that business be allowed to exist?!
If you live in the US, yes. People think it's European because of the name, but it is from NY.

Make those fucking pro-lifers work in child services.

edit* Maybe instead of protesting they could volunteer with kids.
My mom and 3 of her siblings were all adopted by my grandparents and none of them have any sort of sense of abandonment; none have even been remotely interested in seeking out biological family because they consider my grandparents to be their real family just the same as if they were biologically their offsprings. In fact my mom feels like her parent/child bond with her parents is stronger than if they were her biological-parents because they didn‚Äôt just have sex and end up with her as their kid at random, *they chose her specifically*. Bio parents don‚Äôt get to choose their kids. 
And all of my friends I know who are adopted are are for the most part all pretty similar in demeanor about being adopted.
Because normal kid are not troubled so you will not meet the majority ?

I'm adopted and so are my brother and sister (me and my sister at like 5 days, my brother 2 years) and I know many adopted kids and none of us are issues.

I finally had a serious discussion with my wife about this because she always used to argue that "well, he had the knowledge and worked hard to get where he was at"

I argued that, yes, the man is a hard worker and probably very intelligent from looking at his past credentials BUT he still has more than most will make in hundreds of thousands of lifetimes.  I agreed that Bezos deserves to have more than the average Joe due to how much he has put into life, but that the amount he had was the issue.

She at least understood where I was coming from and had an open mind about it this time.  It's progress.

I'm glad your mom had such a great take and understanding of her situation! It sounds like she has a great head on her shoulders. I'm not by any means trying to suggest that all adopted kids have problems and all biological kids are perfect. Being a teenager is hard for everyone; you're treated like a kid and are expected to act like an adult. Those are some crazy mixed signals if you ask me. I was only trying to point out to the questioner that if OP doesn't want to adopt older kids because of the drama that comes with it, adopting a baby doesn't exclude you from that drama. I'm sorry if I came off as demeaning or like I'm gatekeeping or prejudging anyone. That was not my intent.
I never said "normal" kids didn't have problems. I was just pointing out that even children who are adopted as babies can have the same issues as children who are adopted at an older age is all. Sorry if it came across wrong. Also, just because you're adopted doesn't mean you aren't "normal." Be the amazing you that you are!

How does Nestle win this case? The labels clearly state the bottles contain "100% natural spring water", but it is bottled from tap water. As a layman, this is clearly fraud.
‚ÄúNo, no, no. The place has spring as a season, so it‚Äôs all good. Who do we make this ‚Äúdonation‚Äù check out to?‚Äù

-Nestle probably 
I bet it's not from Poland either!
That company hasn‚Äôt been the same since Mr. Pitt‚Äôs failed merger 
They have a long history of dishonesty,  sadly they still keep going from strength to strength.

What about Swiss Miss hot chocolate? Is it not from a Swiss Miss?
Absolutely fuck nestle
I am willing to bet that there is no such thing as the Valley of the Jolly Green Giant and that ranch dressing is not actually made in a Hidden Valley.
The definition of a spring is water coming from an aquifer to the surface. So getting water from the aquifer literally means it is spring water. I grew up there. The same aquifer still feeds into the nearby Range Pond and is still used to bottle water. It is no longer the only water source they use because they got to big for that to be the case, but it still sources from springs around the state.
Just like Nestle gets tons of water from the California aquifer on the cheap I don‚Äôt see this going anywhere. 
Well yeah...most bottled "spring water" is never spring water anyway. 

I remember the first time I tried bottled water and I just threw it away. I sound a bit extreme with that statement but every time I visit my family in the mountains I bring back some spring water from a nearby mountain. That stuff is the cleanest looking water I've ever seen and doesn't have any noticeably odd taste like some bottled water.
Poland Spring is still pretty tasty... for water anyways
To me the definition of the word nestle is FRAUD, especially nutrition and health fraud.


I hate Nestle. Nothing but evil.
But it is from Poland, right....
Maybe they meant metal springs?
I hope the Nestle executives all drown.
I wonder why federal law preempts Vermont consumers from joining the suit

I wish we could stop exploiting springs for the sake of marketing "spring water". It is not F-ing magical, and if I HAVE to buy water, I am damn sure going to avoid any water with "spring water" on the label.

Filtered tap water - that is all that anybody is drinking.

Years ago, just before the "recession" in 2009, Nestle was in the process of building a new bottling facility on a plot of land just on the border of my city.

It eventually failed. They got as far as erecting the skeleton of one structure, and more importantly the local water authority ran a dedicated 12" main to the location. That main taps into the city water supply.

If the plant had been finished and started up, the "spring" water they'd be selling is the same water that comes out of our taps - the only difference is they filter it before bottling it.

'Poland Water' doesn't have the same ring.
Monk is going to be *PISSED.*
I mean, a broken water main is a type of spring
And there is no mountain near where Nestle bottles Ice Mountain.
Next you'll be telling me Red Bull doesn't actually give you wings...
Spring water IS ordinary groundwater.
Oh shit.  Now this?  What else in my life is a lie?
And Evian spelled backwards is naive


If things you advertise need to be factually true, someone please sue Fox for claiming "News". 
They build wells in aquifers all over the state of Maine and pump it into trucks to take it to their bottling plants.  I live in the middle of it. My well water is in a lovely aquifer and tastes better than Poland Spring.  We are never going to run out of water here due to Poland Spring.  
and not from Poland either. Who would believe, eh?
Poland, Michigan...cheers!
Of all the things Nestle does, this really doesn't factor to me at all. They shouldn't be able to continue to consume diminishing reserves of fresh water for free and sell it for a profit. 
Is it even from Poland?
*Pikachu surprised face*
Only in capitalism is it bad to mislabel the source of water, but good to trick poor people into using your shitty baby formula knowing it will cause problems with breast feeding so you can force them to buy your shitty baby formula.

Nestle, the Wells Fargo of food.

When I make money by lying, it's called fraud. I get in trouble for it and they make me give it back.

I should have been a corporation.
Hey Ho! This is in my State, and near me. Wait till the courts learn they truck in water and dump in on the ground, and then pump it up somewhere else as 'spring water'
Oh Jesus who gives a shit. Soo bad. Real first world problems. 
Being from Europe, it blew my mind when I first visited the US that a brand would romanticize the image of Poland as a place where pure springs of fresh water exist. Maybe Poland is all that great (I've never been) but the connection just ain't jumping out at me for a brand strategy. 
Fuck Nestle. CEO said water isnt a right and we should have to buy it from them. Who the fuck did you buy it from Nestle??? 
I'm very close to someone higher up at Nestle. This has been a not-so-hidden secret for years. Glad to finally see them called out for it.
Poland is pretty far down the list of countries I associate with purity, freshness, etc. I picture a muddy puddle in front of a concrete apartment when I hear "Poland Spring".
This is so stupid, a company selling some dumb keywords that only idiots would buy getting sued for not having the genuine BS they're trying to sell.
 
There's a small spring contained within every faucet in their bottling facilities. 
It's not tap water.  It's ground water.   That makes things a lot more legally nebulous and I suspect the legal definition of a spring is somewhat murky.  All a spring is, after all, is ground water that flows naturally out of the ground on its own.   
Oh, you thought they meant the kind of water that comes from a spring? No, this is water that is meant to be drunk after March 21. In the Spring.

Notice how the bottle does not say "100% natural spring water", as you allege. It says "100% NATURAL SPRING WATER", in capital letters because that's what our marketing people recommended. If we were to write it normally, it would be "100% natural Spring water". Water that you drink in Springtime.
How does Nestle keep getting the rights to rape our dwindling water supplies for less than pennies.

Money and bribes.
It can be both.  If the tap water comes from a spring, it's still spring water.  The tap water part is irrelevant, because let's face it, ANY bottled water is going to be processed and run through various taps and tubes.

If it comes from wells or other non-spring sources before it gets into what I assume is the municipal water supply, then yeah, that's fraud.
Don't see the point, really...I've seen spring water that would make you puke.
There isn't really municipal water where the extraction plants are. There are aquifers and wells though. The bastards are higher up in the water table than a lot of the more populous towns in the areas of their plants and drain a ton of the water leaving shitty sludgie hard water for the towns "downstream." Source: lived 20 minutes from the Kingfield plant(shown on their packaging).
Because you don't know what spring water actually is. Spring water is essentially ground water.
The way I see it, the bigger fraud is the whole concept of bottled water.

Edit: People clearly value their bottled water, and my comment is short-sighted, especially after considering places like Flint.

My view must have a lot to do with being old. I remember a time when bottled water was hardly a thing. Some people would drink seltzer, but I don't remember anyone carrying around plastic bottles of water the way they do today.

Somehow we bought into it, and in a way I feel like we're being ripped off. But maybe we aren't. 
The tap could be connected to a conduit at least partially fed from a well?
About as correct as saying "100% dinosaur piss"
And they'll pay a couple million and just change the text to something like "Water sourced from crystal clear springs" where they're saying the water they use *has as its originating source* at some point been, a natural spring. 

Or some other marketing lying-not-lying lingo.
"we only bottle it in March-May, when we say spring water we mean spring as in the season."
It's collected during the Polish spring season. 100% natural spring water. /s
Until recently, the town it's from was called Poland Spring, ME. They renamed to Poland in the last decade or so.
Well, the water sort of sprung from the tap...
It's all from a natural spring. That pipe dumping municipal water on the ground at a slightly higher elevation, yeah don't worry about that, that's not us, it's some other company we own.
There was a taste test conducted outside a restaurant using various bottled water, tap water and garden hose water... to be fair it was a new hose, still, it garnered votes.
>The labels clearly state the bottles contain "100% natural spring water", but it is bottled from tap water.

The label says the water is sourced from various springs in Maine. Where did you hear that it was actually just tap water?
Money. See Smollett
It was poured from the tap between March 21-June 21.

&#x200B;
Because they pump their water from the aquifer that feeds a spring.  That pump may send the water through a tap, but it‚Äôs still spring water.  If you think Nestle was getting millions and millions of gallons of water from a little babbling brook, you‚Äôd be quite mistaken.
It CONTAINS 100% natural spring water.  It doesn't claim to be only 100% natural spring water.


I could pour 1L of 100% natural spring water in a vat of 1,000,000 L and it would be true to claim that it CONTAINS 100% natural spring water.
Hope springs eternal.
Spring water is the brand name? Like Subway did with the foot long
You would lose that bet, it is from Poland Maine.
Welcome to Maine, where like 90% of the towns are named after other countries or cities in other countries.
You mean the pierogi stretchwrapped to the bottle isn‚Äôt authentic??
I dunno it definitely could be from
Poland Ohio
I mean what do you expect them to call it, Moland Spring? No one would drink something named Moland.
My favorite Seinfeld episode, mostly because the failed merger was just one of 4 concurrent story lines that they managed to squeeze into one 22 minute episode all interweaved together. This episode was densely packed even by Seinfeld standards.
Moland was my immediate thought.
Yeah nestle has done a hell of a lot worse than mislabeling tap water
They also have a history of [murder](https://www.dw.com/en/nestle-under-fire-over-colombian-murder/a-16195009).

It's schrodinger's program... it counts as only entertainment when looked at in a court
Poland, Maine
Thats why people should stop buying spring water. on some occasions i do buy water but its usually the very generic brands
Yes.  Poland, Maine.
Poland, Maine - the place where the water was originally bottled when the company first started (before Nestle bought them out).
It has nothing to do with Poland in Europe,
He did not say that. Find me the quote where he said "water is not a right" 
It has nothing to do with the country - the company got its start in Poland, Maine.
So because where I live I can't drink the tap water, I guess I am an idiot because I have to buy about 10 gallons of water a week for drinking, cooking and giving to my pets?  GTFOH with your idiot self.
That spring? It comes from one of those cheap clicky pens.
This is amazing and I wish they would use this defense.
Its kind of like the Bon and Ivy(?) Spiked Sparkling shit that boasts no sugar or whatever. Like anyone that understands fermentation knows that glucose is a major factor. You‚Äôre trying to tell me there‚Äôs no sugar?! 
Yep. There is no [legal definition](http://www.finewaters.com/bottled-water-sources/spring-water) of spring water. Huh. Wait, found it:

> The name of water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth may be "spring water." Spring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice. The location of the spring shall be identified. Spring water collected with the use of an external force shall be from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. If spring water is collected with the use of an external force, water must continue to flow naturally to the surface of the earth through the spring's natural orifice. Plants shall demonstrate, on request, to appropriate regulatory officials, using a hydrogeologically valid method, that an appropriate hydraulic connection exists between the natural orifice of the spring and the bore hole.

[FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Volume 2 Revised as of April 1, 2018 CITE: 21CFR165.110](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=165.110&SearchTerm=bottled%20water)

So legally, as long as Nestle drills from the same formation, all good so saith the FDA.
It's spring water... that hasn't yet reached the spring.

*Springtime for Nestle, and Germany...*
*Nestl√© legal team wants your location*
They don't. The reddit misinformation machine just circle jerks daily about the company. 
Yeah spring water really doesn‚Äôt mean clean water. Not at all. 
Ground water is just like spring water, except it hasn‚Äôt had a chance to become filled with mosquito larva, and snakes and other water creatures aren‚Äôt having sex in it. I‚Äôd take well water over spring water any day. The deeper it is, the cleaner it is. 
I agree where tap water is safe to drink. However tap water is not always safe to drink. For example I wouldn't want to consume Flint's water without first purifying it.
Yeah, no. Here in the Philippines, and my travels through India, bottled water is a necessity. Can‚Äôt drink from tap without risking illness. 
How is bottled water "fraud"?
Given how long the dinosaurs existed and hire large they were, it's almost guaranteed that any particular molecule of water was once part of dinosaur piss.
True, but to claim "100% natural spring water" is different than "10% spring water"
Spring water and tap water are not mutually exclusive.

Hook your tap up to spring water, and wow you have both.

If the municipal water is fed from springs, it too is spring water.
It used to be... now it's from the Fryeburg/Conway municipal water system.
Ugh yeah after I go to Mexico I have to drive to South China, it's gonna take a whole 2 hours.
> pierogi  

Oh damn, *that's* how you spell it?
Hahahah. ‚ÄúAnd the stock will rise HIGH!‚Äù
Slavery too
Oh, that is ok
Its a spring that comes directly out of the rockface of a mountain so its filtered naturally and doesn't require boiling.
I guess I'll be the first to admit that I don't Google literally everything and some things I still guess at.

I would also have assumed it came from Poland so it's like cool once-frosty exotic mountain spring water shipped over to the USA.
Next they need to start making Champagne from Paris, Texas
If I buy bottled I'll just look for any brand that's purified. Even Walmart has cheap ass purified water. ( reverse osmosis).  I also fill a 5 gal. jug for $2 
Aaaahhhh, that explains it!
Quiet you‚Äôre going against the top Reddit sentiment 
You‚Äôre going to get nowhere with facts about nestle here.
I'm talking about the marketing, the words 'natural spring' water.  Neither natural, nor spring means anything about water quality, they're just buzzwords and if that's what you're choosing your water based on that is stupid.  Wasn't talking about the idea of buying water bottles in general, which, as you've pointed it out, is often necessary.
Yes you are an idiot, you should be filtering/distilling your water in that case.
Hilarious. God damn hilarious. I wish I could upvote more than once.
And what do you think happens to the sugar when it is fermented?
\> Yep. There is no [legal definition](http://www.finewaters.com/bottled-water-sources/spring-water) of spring water. Huh. Wait, found it: 

Except I never said there was no legal definition of spring water.  Quite the contrary, in fact.  Huh.

Frankly, the value of "spring water" is completely illogical anyway.  Either it is tasty and refreshing ground water or its not.  Whether it flows to the surface on its own or not, either now or 50 years ago, should make no difference whatsoever.  Basically, we are paying for romantic imagery as it pertains to...uh...water.  *Water*.  In effect, this lawsuit is about Nestle possibly playing it fast and loose in defining what is in effect an illogical marketing premise.
I mean, *technically* all water "flows naturally to the surface of the earth". It's just that in some cases, nature made humans which made pumps.. from nature stuff.
They bottle it early so it's fresh by the time you get it!
I mean, every molecule of water on earth has probably flowed through a spring millions of times.
no no, its water youre meant to pour into a spring thats dried up because theyre stealing billions of gallons of water and causing drought 
There is a problem with the horizon...there is no horizon.

Are you telling me that my Yellowstone Spring water business isn‚Äôt going to be successful ?
Spring water is fed by an underground source and moving.

Mosquitoes don‚Äôt lay eggs in moving water and snakes won‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôs cold. 

Spring water is usually safe to drink if you‚Äôre near the source. 
Some people are really sensitive to water taste too.  I used to feel sick drinking water at my previous residence as it often smelled like bleach.  My tap water in my new home doesn't taste great either, so I'm still drinking bottled.  I'll probably get a whole house filter sometime in the next 6mos.  
Or if it tastes ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE like it does where I live. Also, my mother has water retention issues, and in places with a high mineral content in their groundwater, it can actually make her retain so much water that it becomes painful to walk or move, and risks causing life-threatening complications. Sure, she can take a diuretic, but popping those isn't exactly great for your kidneys. 
Which quite honestly is an insane disgrace. How can a first world country have literal poison coming out of their taps for like 5 years. Bottled water in Bangladesh or something makes sense, but in the US? I‚Äôd rather go to Nigeria and drink from a tap than in Flint. 
It's from a lot of towns, it's actually pictured on their packaging. They extract a lot in Kingfield, I believe they bottle up there too along with trucking tree tankers elsewhere, maybe for different bottlers or bottling lines.
Haha you guys make me miss home. 
Boy am I going to blow your mind when I tell you pierogi is actually the plural form, and pierog is the singular. 
Out of curiosity, how would you have spelled it? 
My gut is very sensitive to various microorganisms, and I cannot count how many times this tempting crispy clean rockface water has caused diarrhea in me. I can drink safely only either charcoal filtered water or boiled water (even from a swamp)
Yea bacteria can't live on rocks
No. You should boil that water before consumption.
Well, that's pretty cool.
Yes, be sure to tell that to the people of Flint, MI or any other place where the water is not drinkable. 
And to distill water isn't like using a fucking Brita you asshat, here is how to do it.  https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Distill-Water/


Make more accounts bro. Do it for him. He deserves it
I thought it was alright, but upvoted anyway, just for you
Yeah I made a brain fart. 
Yup. I'm half surprised that there aren't cans of mountain air for sale yet...
Oh, I agree with you. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted to find the legal definition to know if Nestle can get away with calling it spring water. Looks like the FDA had them covered.
Rain falls from the sky.  Rain is water.
No, this isn't even technically correct. Pumps aren't natural; you're misusing that word.
It's also been drank and pissed out by every type of creature on earth.
It's a good pun, we'll allow it...
Where should I start. 

- The CEO of Nestle never said that "Water is not a human right". Yet I see it here all the time (including several comments in this very thread!)

- Nestle has never bribed an American official. Again, several comments in this thread imply it is happening. 

- Nestle never tried to dry up mother's breastmilk in third world countries and then charge them absurd amounts to buy formula. I see this all the time on reddit. 

- Nestle does not take water from drought stricken California and sell it back to them for a profit. 

I can go on if you want me to
There‚Äôs a natural spring on my property. It feeds a small swampy area that is full of mosquitoes and snakes. 

There is a spring on my grandparents farm too. When I was a kid they built a spring house around it. It‚Äôs always full of snakes. It‚Äôs like a fuck shack for venomous snakes and mosquitoes. Not every spring has a huge flow. Most of them just trickle water into larger pools. Mosquitoes find them perfectly acceptable. 
Chloramine causes that odor it is the industrial chemical used to sanitize many municipal water supplies for safety. Some people are pretty sensitive to it.
I got an under sink filter for about $100 and installed it in about an hour. Seriously, buying huge quantities of bottled water for your household is silly. You can be picky *and* not have to settle without sending thousands of plastic bottles a month to the land fill. Not trying to dump on you or anything, but you don't have to wait 6 months.
That's absolutely a fair concern. And falls well within the concern related to health issues. 
When I worked there we were even bottling some Deer Park water with water from the Fryeburg well... I would bet dimes to donuts that most of it comes from Fryeburg, even at the Kingfield bottling plant.

They have "sources" all over the state but they actually manage closely which ones they're pulling from.
It‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúpier√≥g‚Äù 
Oh. My. GOD.
Honestly I never thought about it before but, maybe perogi, one less "i."
> Out of curiosity, how would you have spelled it? 

I T.....It's just a two letter pronoun for everything......This test is gonna be easy.
Pyeah-raw-ghee
I never said that distilling water is like using a Brita; in fact I never used the word ‚ÄúBrita‚Äù.

By the way, distilling water is extremely simple.

Edit: oh god that article is funny as fuck. So inefficient.
More accounts doesn‚Äôt get you more votes btw
Easy there Unidan...
I just love the idea of a blantant fuck you corporate loophole because it's so depressingly realistic. "look shareholders, if we get real spring water, it's expensive for us! But if we shoot tap water THROUGH a spring, it's wayyyy more cost effective."
They sell small cans of supposedly oxygenated air in the mountains, does that count?
Here you go: [Icelandic fresh mountain air](https://www.idontspeakicelandic.com/products/icelandic-fresh-mountain-air).
People sell Canadian ice. People will buy anything.
Sky spring. 
Does rain not flow(fall, but flow isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong) naturally to the surface of the earth, as he said?
So. . ..  consider only the most recent origin of the water before it hits plumbing.

Rain to cistern to tap rainwater.


Aquifer to tap is groundwater

Water source to water treatment facility to city mains ..  municipal tap water


Ta da.  Proximity to the rescue

Once it reaches stagnant water it‚Äôs no longer a spring. That‚Äôs a pond or marsh. 
If you live in an area with corrupt government running the water that isn't going to do anything.

A simple filter isn't going to stop a lot of metals and poisons.  Only a reverse osmosis trap will and those are more expensive.

Though there are only a few places like that in the US, most of the world cannot drink tap water.

Fair enough. For me, I bought a Brita filter because it gets rid of the bleach taste in my municipal water supply. Also, for people who have taste issues with their water, and want something portable, Brita makes a waterbottle with a built in filter. It basically has a big straw that goes down into the bottle, with a miniaturized  standard filter inside. 
I work in DSD and started seeing a lot of Deer Park in Poland territory at the end of last year. In Stop N Shop especially.
Yes, I know but I live in the States so I don't have a Polish keyboard and didn't feel like copy and pasting letters. Plus, it's not like that would mean anything when I'm telling it to someone who doesn't speak the language so there was no reason for me to spell it with the accent.

You say this like Canadian ice isn't better, which is a bizarre statement to make. Would you not have bbq from the southern us, or ramen from japan, or stinky foot cheese from france?
A spring can flow as little as 1 pint per minute before it is considered a Seep. That‚Äôs only 16 ounces of water every 60 seconds. My spring has a pool about 5 foot round and maybe a foot deep in the middle. Lets assume it‚Äôs a cylinder for the sake of the math we‚Äôre about to do. To find the volume of a cylinder we multiply Pi times the squared radius. 3.14x2.5x1=19.63cubic feet of water. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot of water. So there are pretty close to 150 gallons of water in that small pool. There are only 16 oz flowing in and out of it per minute. A mosquito would have no trouble whatsoever living in that. 
I‚Äôm telling you, snakes and mosquitoes hang around springs. I have personally seen it many times. I guess I need to get some crayons and draw you a picture.
There are reverse osmosis filters for ~$200 USD. Also this guy was complaining about taste so I assume heavy metals aren't the issue, though that may be an additional concern meaning a fairly inexpensive 2 stage carbon filter is perfectly adequate.
I love these threads because people's anger at Nestle is completely misdirected. They're not causing drought in Maine... but they treat their employees like absolute shit. The company completely abuses the unemployment system and it's not the European parent-- it's the American managers that control the plants. They do everything they possibly can to undermine the good practices the parent  company forces them into.
I have always heard it pronounced per-ogi
He might be like me, living where they're not really a thing. I'd never even heard of it until a friend introduced me to them.
You can, but they only count as one vote for calculating totals. It‚Äôs so easy to make accounts that bots could put anything on the front page instantly if they were counted that way. There‚Äôs still bots, but they have to jump through a lot more hoops to influence votes. 
Could you actually get some crayons and draw me a picture?
> I‚Äôm telling you, snakes and mosquitoes hang around springs.

So they hang around the ponds and marshes, you know, next to the spring because that is what every spring feeds into.

What part of that do you not understand?
Nice patronizing there! I guess no one ever told you that being an asshole is unattractive. 

Mosquitoes don‚Äôt lay their eggs in moving water. You may see them in the vicinity, but they only lay eggs in stagnant water. 

A ‚Äúspring‚Äù is a very well defined term, different from a creek or pond. It is a source of groundwater that is always moving and almost always cold. If you see mosquito eggs, that‚Äôs not a spring. 

And why on Earth would your grandparents build a shack that attracts the critters you‚Äôre complaining about? They took an environment that doesn‚Äôt naturally cultivate them and made it perfect. Snakes like dark, damp, cool (but not cold) spaces. You build it, and they will come. Same with ‚Äòskeeters. 
> They're not causing drought in Maine... but they treat their employees like absolute shit.

They may not cause a drought, but they sure don't slow down their strip-pumping of my area when there is one. I'm always glad my well is pumping nothing but rust while they're shipping $3/bottle tap water.
Ohhhh. So you‚Äôre saying it recognizes if multiple votes come from the same IP address?
I can‚Äôt see the eggs, but I can damn sure see the larva squiggling about. I assume the larva hatched from eggs laid there, and didn‚Äôt just spontaneously arise from the ether.

A spring is a very well defined term. A spring can flow as little as 1 pint per minute before it is considered a Seep. I already wrote all of this in another comment, so check that out. 
It‚Äôs even more complicated than that. Even with different IPs, if they start voting too much identically, they stop getting counted as different accounts. I think the exact algorithm is secret, to keep up with spammers and bots trying to outsmart it.
The violators were fired, at least. 
how miserable do you have to be to punch a cow? LOL
.. which is all perfectly legal.    One can fuck with 'farm' animals to whatever extent they want - legally.  Do the same thing to a cat/dog and you can have felony animal cruelty charges.

It is almost like there is a disconnect of sorts between farm animals and pets.  Go figure...

One of the reasons I'm becoming a vegan. 
Sadly this is very common in farms..
All milk production involves animal abuse.

Cows, like people, only produce milk because of pregnancy. That means that the cows on dairy farms get artificially inseminated, which entails the farmer sticking their arm into the cow‚Äôs rectum up to the elbow and putting a metal rod into the cow‚Äôs vagina. The calf is taken away after it‚Äôs born, and then either killed for meat or raised for the same life as its mother. This process repeats roughly annually until the cow is around six (only 30% of its natural lifespan), at which point it is killed for its meat.

I‚Äôm happy to see abusers face consequences, but we shouldn‚Äôt let ourselves ignore the abuse that isn‚Äôt even illegal, let alone punished.
First off Fuck Nestle as a whole.
Secondly why they gotta do shit like this, I‚Äôm on the edge of being vegan now:/
This gives a dark meaning to the Crunch bar.
How do you think *Skinny Cow* got so thin?
What the fuck? How do you actually become this shitty?
What the actual fuck is wrong with people! Animal abusers need to die.
Some of the things in this articles are properly bad but there also were a couple of things that are just part of dealing with animal, especially wounded ones. 

What stood out to me:

* "Why are they shocking her?‚Äù "To get her to move forward into the head trap so she will stay still,‚Äù

Cows can be incredibly stubborn and at times you are left with no other option. 

*  Plus, cows unable to walk hoisted by their hips or feet and then dragged. 

If an animal is sick or wounded there is no other way to move it to pen for it to be treated or recovered

*  botched attempt at putting down a cow. A 2nd shot to the head needed because the first gunshot didn't do the job. 

I doubt he was trying to miss there. 
Go. Fucking. Vegan. Stop babbling on about lab grown meat rubbish. Stop supporting the suffering right here, right now and quit the excuses. Don't pay to have animals tortured and killed. 
Punch a cow. You'll only hurt your hand.
Fuck nestle (doesn't even deserve an N)
This is the reasn i became vegan
I believe it. 

Go buy some Nestle chocolate milk right fucking now, and any other kind of chocolate milk, beatrice, sealtest, you name it, Nestle tastes like shit for some reason. 
Man how tf you gonna punch a cow? 

That‚Äôs like punching your dog (if your dog weighed a ton, anyway)
By nephlaphim (there they are!)

cause cows pretty big to stomp on
The second I see ‚ÄúNestl√©‚Äù on the title, I thought ‚Äúwhat did they do this time?‚Äù  Honestly not surprised. 
\>implying anybody eating dairy gives a shit about the animals
Things like this are totally legal in first world countries and it's so sad. This is just another reason to stop eating animals an their secretions
Nestle makes the very best, except when they dont. Which is always.
How else are you gonna get ALL the milk out?
All factory farming is brutal to animals. Billions of animals are suffering. 
Is that why I get angry when I eat Nestle dairy stuff? 
Is anyone actually surprised by stuff like this at this point? Its shit like this that I always point to when people ask my why I as a rule always assume the worst out of corporations. They ask us to trust them and they ALWAYS abuse that trust. Why does anyone ever trust any corporation ever?
but the owners are still going strong
And more will be hired. 
It's partly because of the work conditions. A violent environment makes people violent.

Exactly, most farms are governed by "popular" law, where whatever actions are commonly practiced are legal. When most farms are owned by a small handful of companies, they can essentially do whatever they want and it will be commonly practiced, and therefore legal.
Does it make rich people richer/happier? Than the law is not a factor.
It's so silly, this guy punches and kicks them and no one bats an eye, but as soon as you stick your dick in one everyone starts getting uncomfortable and calls the police. Hypocrites.
In your neck of the woods. The EU has got some neat animal welfare laws.
pretty sure lab grown meat isnt going to produce dairy products. I mean you can milk almonds but thats a special case
And until it's here...? *crickets*
Literally.  It can't get here fast enough for the climate, for our health, for animals enduring this cruelty. We can't wait for technology to save us.
Or you could just stop eating meat now like millions of others...
I know we‚Äôd be able to do it, but my concern is with the state of politics and just how much influence lobbyists have, any attempt to make it widespread would fail. At least in the US. I can already hear the arguments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unnatural and thus unhealthy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThink of all the jobs you‚Äôre killing!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be killing the economy by destroying a major portion of its profits!‚Äù Etc etc. Won‚Äôt stop me cause while I‚Äôm a moron, even I know artificial meat that‚Äôs chemically identical to natural meat won‚Äôt make a difference while I dig in like the disgusting meat whore I am. 
Awesome! I'm glad to help if you have any questions
[deleted]
Except it‚Äôs not. Do you have a source, any abuse statistics? Literally the number one thing they teach in dairy management is that happy/healthy/well treated cows produce exceptionally higher volume and quality. 

Besides it being the morally right thing to do to treat these animals well. (Which I‚Äôll agree with you a corporation may not care about) it is also financially 100% in their best interest to have their animals treated appropriately 
[deleted]
/R/Happycowgifs for further motivator 
No time the present! If you have any questions about going vegan feel free to message me.
> Cows can be incredibly stubborn and at times you are left with no other option.

The other option is not having animal agriculture.

> If an animal is sick or wounded there is no other way to move it to pen for it to be treated or recovered

There wouldn‚Äôt be sick or wounded animals to move if we didn‚Äôt maintain an artificially high population through artificial insemination.

We shouldn‚Äôt pretend that these things are unavoidable when the answer is right in front of us.

Their chocolate tastes like plastic.  Compare any other brand side-by-side.  Nestl√© must be adding vegetable oil.  It's bizarre.
\>implying anybody eating plants gives a shit about nature

You can drink milk and still care about animals
There was a good article about chicken farming that showed how monopsonists encourage abuse. They never explicitly order anything damaging; they just establish performance targets that can't be reached without abusive conditions, and then they set farmers against each other until the survivors do whatever it takes to stay in business:  
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/whose-farm-is-this-anyway/569227/  
  
> ‚ÄúThe company has 99-and-a-half percent control over the grower,‚Äù said Jonathan Buttram, the president of the Alabama Contract Poultry Growers Association and an outspoken critic of the industry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll list what they tell you: what time to pick up the chickens, what time to run the feed, what time to turn the lights off and on, every move that you make. Then, they say we‚Äôre not an employee‚Äîwe are employees, but they won‚Äôt let us have any kind of benefits or insurance.‚Äù
Yet for all the control the poultry businesses have over the farmers, the farmers maintain significant financial and legal risk. They have little job security. They can get dumped for a different supplier, and face a tournament-style system that pits them against fellow growers.

They'll make sure to do a better job of hiding the abuse this time, though.
That's disgusting. :(
Weeohweeohwee. *Phlem*

Just grow mammary glands. Those are meat too. Getting them to work correctly will be an interesting challenge though.
If it has nipples you can milk it. 
The majority of the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, calcium, manganese, boron, iron magnesium, potassium, copper, molybdenum, etc) in our food come from soil mineralization.  The amounts that we add as fertilizer pales in comparison, except maybe nitrogen.  

If lab grown meat or indoor farming ever does take off to the point that it displaces a significant proportion of traditional farming or meat production I wonder what the environmental impact of mining all of the extra nutrients might be.  

edit: I'm looking at world production of several of the elements and it doesn't look like lab grown meat/indoor farming would require a huge increase in mining in order to meet human nutritional needs.
Do you seriously think we are going to grow cows as pets? As soon as lab grown beef becomes a reality, cows will be extinct faster than Blockbuster video.  
I seriously wonder what peoples' end game is when they want meat eating to stop.  
Because 1000 acre chicken and cow sanctuaries isn't it.

You are too kind, pterodactyl anus.

The overwhelming majority of farms artificially inseminate cows and kill them long before their natural lifespans would be up. Those are standard industry practices, and neither of them is for the benefit of the cows.

Farmers don‚Äôt give a shit about the well-being of their cows. If they did, they wouldn‚Äôt do the things I mentioned. What they care about is maximizing profit‚Äîit‚Äôs just that sometimes that lines up with not constantly torturing the cows.
That is simply not a realistic option, and absolutely waste of resources due to how ineffective it is. 

We haven't lived like that for a hundred years. And you are blaming that memes and smartphones...?
Or we could just feed people the crops like soy and corn that we‚Äôre currently feeding the cows, in which case there would be plenty to eat for everyone, and we wouldn‚Äôt have to do fascist stuff like regulating who can give birth.
I appreciate thatüëç
That would be an "option" but that's not what i'm talking about. 

I'm explaining why some of the things in this article are being done. 

Your assumption that there wouldn't be any sick animals simply because the population is high is ridiculous, you don't leave a sick animal outside in the rain for example.
Cattle would still be born in the wild. We have bulls that would happily impregnate cows.

Or the wild boar situations in Oklahoma where pigs run rampant in rural areas. They breed like crazy. You can take AI out of the picture but you are still going to have cattle.
Beef is delicious and healthy. You should try it sometime
No such thing as ethical slaughter. 
The good thing is there are a lot of dairy and egg substitutes. Consider trying some and replacing some dairy and eggs when it works. [Here is some good info](https://veganuary.com/starter-kit/) I believe every bit helps. 
nestle is no longer in candy business ( atleast for US)
I like to compare it to wax.  Sugar wax.
Plants, famous for their ability to Feel
If your version of caring about animals includes being okay with a farmer shoving his arm up a cow‚Äôs ass all the way to the elbow to artificially inseminate the cow, I think you might want to reevaluate how much you really care.
Only if you forget about how the milk got there.
And as long as you guys commenting about it change nothing and live lavishly this is what you support :-)

I never could get over the hair around the nipples.
Does cheese whiz count?
Walls full of boobs. Somebody just went to their happy place.
I have nipples and am a male. Can you milk me?
I keep trying to type this without sounding like I am attacking you and I am failing at it. So please know this is not meant to come across as pointed or attacking at all as it sounds.

Look at the nutritional information on the side of a box of cereal. Vitamin A is vitamin A, vitamin D is vitamin D, sodium is sodium, potassium is potassium, no matter if it comes from natural sources or is artificially synthesized.

For a very long time lab grown meat will only be ground meat. We can just add nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, calcium, manganese, boron, iron magnesium, potassium, copper, molybdenum from other sources into the ground product. We can get every last one of those from vegan sources. 

It will cost more for sure. But the day I can buy lab grown meat will be the last day I ever buy meat that came from a living animal. Thats a very weak stance for being against lab grown meat.
There are already many feral cattle living around the world. I don't see the possible extinction of certain domesticated cattle breeds that were artificially brought into existence as a great evil. Certainly not an evil that outweighs their current existence. Even so, it's not hard to imagine in a world compassionate enough to stop breeding them for food that there would be people compassionate enough to work against their becoming extinct.
"My actions won't make much difference when millions of others will never change theirs," said millions of people.

Edit: Lab grown meat can solve the ethical problems, but I won't be convinced it will solve the environmental problems until we have production implemented on a massive scale.
But we're not in control of others' actions, we're in control of our own. Just because a lot of people contribute to some injustice doesn't mean that we should join in as well.
So why not at least try to be a part of the solution even if you believe you can't make everyone a part of it?
Definitely, what are some of your favorite foods now?

> it‚Äôs just that sometimes that lines up with not constantly torturing the cows.

I love that you're arguing with someone who has spent a career in the field and knows better, and yet still spouting nonsense. You literally believe that every farmer loves to torture things.

All pet owners are torturers. Prove me wrong.
>Farmers don‚Äôt give a shit about the well-being of their cows. If they did, they wouldn‚Äôt do the things I mentioned. What they care about is maximizing profit‚Äîit‚Äôs just that sometimes that lines up with not constantly torturing the cows.

Bullshit.  I work in the livestock industry as an independent producer.  The well being of my cattle is my well being.

I make damn sure that my cattle get the nutrients they need to remain healthy.  I provide prompt medical treatment when they are sick or injured.  If they need shade or shelter in hot or inclement weather, they have it.  24/7 access to clean drinking water and fresh forage is my priority.   Healthy and healthy cattle is what I strive for every goddam day.

Yes, I'm quite well aware of the eventual fate of my cattle.  It hurts me deeply, but I try to give them a decent life while I can. And I personally challenge you to come to my farm and find *one* instance of abuse or neglect.  I'm not talking out of my ass either; come on over and I'll show you everything.  I have nothing to hide.


Yes they are raised for meat. Of course the cows are slaughtered. Part of life 
And vegetarians don‚Äôt care about all the insects killed to produce their food but since insects aren‚Äôt cute and cuddly it doesn‚Äôt matter to them. 
[removed]
You can‚Äôt eat most of what‚Äôs fed to cows.....
Well, I think it‚Äôs important to phrase things in terms of what their justifications are rather than saying it‚Äôs the only option. We have other options even if you don‚Äôt like them.

> Your assumption that there wouldn't be any sick animals simply because the population is high is ridiculous, you don't leave a sick animal outside in the rain for example.

We leave sick wild animals out in the rain all the time. If we stop farming animals, there wouldn‚Äôt be any animals on farms to ‚Äúhave to‚Äù move.
Yeah, but like the rest of the wild animals, we don‚Äôt have to electrocute them or drag them around.
I‚Äôm flattered that you think I was born vegan, but I have, in fact, eaten cows. Vegan food is delicious and healthier than animal products, but I‚Äôm not vegan for the taste or the health benefits.
[deleted]
wait really? who did they sell the brands to then?
Brilliant.  That's exactly it.
Yeah. I'm going to continue eating meat, because it tastes damn good and that's what makes life valuable and enjoyable for me, but I'm not going to pretend that I care about the well-being of those animals when I sit down to eat an animal I know was tortured to get there. I love my dog because she's cute and amusing to me, but I would be lying to myself if I pretended dog meat or horse meat is inherently any different than cow meat.
The alternative is them being in nature.  Nature is not without it's cruelty's.
> a farmer shoving his arm up a cow‚Äôs **ass** all the way to the elbow to artificially inseminate the cow

You don't have kids do you?
I mean if that's what the cow is into who are we to judge?
Some people pay for that kind of thing. Currently on a dairy free diet before you get upset.

Nope, it does actually have cheese in it.
Actually yeah
What I'm saying is that to grow meat in a lab (or factory) you need to bring in all of the various minerals that make up meat.  Or if you are going to grow food in a vertical farm, the same.  If you are going to displace a significant portion of food with these types production you are going to have to acquire a large amount of these minerals.  

Already in farming we acquire some of them through mining and apply them as fertilizer.  But except for nitrogen and carbon most of them come from the soil through mineralization and not mining in the traditional sense.  

I don't know what you mean by acquiring them from vegan sources.    I mean mining doesn't require killing animals, so I guess that is vegan?  

My question was what might the environmental impact of the additional mining for minerals be.  After a little bit of research, I don't think it would be a huge impact.  To make the system truly sustainable we could harvest them from human waste, but I don't know if that would be a economically or technically viable option.  
[deleted]
What? I‚Äôm not arguing that farmers love torture. I‚Äôm saying that the parts of farming where animals are treated well only exist to the extent that they line up with profit. When profit and animal rights conflict, the farmers pick profit every time.
But none of that contradicts what I said. You care about the well-being of your cows when it works out that it helps you profit, and you stop caring about the well-being of your cows when hurting them results in you getting more money.

I‚Äôll admit I was being a little hyperbolic in my phrasing, but I think it‚Äôs completely fair to say that you prioritize profit over the well-being of your cows. You‚Äôve just redefined what it means to care about them so that killing doesn‚Äôt count as a sign of not caring.
I‚Äôm aware of that (although I take exception to the ‚Äúpart of life‚Äù part). I‚Äôm saying that slaughter is not in the best interest of the cows, nor does it make them happy, healthy, well-treated, or treated appropriately.  Furthermore, it is not morally right.
Speaking as someone who‚Äôs vegan and not vegetarian, I do care. I don‚Äôt want insects and field mice and whatever other animals to die for my food. It just turns out that being vegan minimizes the numbers of those animals that are killed.
You seem deranged. Holy shit.
You‚Äôre a bit out there if you think people choosing to produce crops for food rather than the less efficient producing crops for animal feed for food is fascism and equates to population control. 

You can easily raise your own meat if that‚Äôs your prerogative.  
You can eat enough of it, and everyone going vegan would free up enormous amounts of land, water, and fuel to produce crops for the world regardless.

Whenever you eat animal products, for every 100 calories you get, the animal had to eat about 1000 calories. That‚Äôs incredibly inefficient. Eating crops directly is way more efficient.
You've been incredibly frustrating to talk to. We wouldn't need any seat belts if we had no cars either. And sure a world without cars, why not. But that is not what i'm talking about.

> I'm going to continue eating meat, because it tastes damn good and that's what makes life valuable and enjoyable for me

I wonder how enjoyable your trivial habit is for the animals who get tortured and killed hmmmm
I have worked on farms, most farmers do give a shit about their cattle, not just about their bottom line. No one wants to see a baby calf freeze to death or get stuck in the mud to where it cannot be saved even by machinery.

No one wants a cow to blow out a knee and walking with a click. Yes they profit off their herd but no one wants them to suffer in life up until slaughter. At least most farmers I have ever worked with here in Kansas.
If eating dead things is what makes life enjoyable for you then I'll be praying for you! I hope you find something else to live for that doesn't cause pain and suffering.
no it isn't, as cows are not wild animals.
No, the alternative is not artificially inseminating animals to have billions of animals living as livestock that wouldn‚Äôt exist otherwise.
Very funny, but I‚Äôm not making this up.

You can watch an instructional video from a farmer on how it works:

[https://youtu.be/R6fYyxs_lDE](https://youtu.be/R6fYyxs_lDE) 
If that was your takeaway here I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. It‚Äôs pretty obvious the cows don‚Äôt enjoy it, and quite frankly it‚Äôs disturbing that you‚Äôre joking about it.
[removed]
There is no big lab meat industry yet, so any source claiming that is speculative. And there are studies suggesting [it might actually be worse.](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/612990/lab-grown-meat-could-be-worse-for-the-environment-than-beef/)
You're claiming that animal agriculture is 'constant torture'. How can you then not claim that farmers love to torture things? Are they being tortured constantly or not?
I don't stop caring when it diminishes my profit for the year.  

If I spend another grand on antibiotics to get them through an outbreak of pneumonia, so be it.  I'm not going to see them suffer unnecessarily, even if ignoring the problem would put money in my pocket.  I don't hurt my cattle intentionally, or unintentionally (but shit happens).  

See, I'm pretty sure you've never lived this lifestyle.  It takes the mindset of a dog owner with enough detachment to chow down on a fido-burger after a few months pass.  I care about the animals as living beings, it's the humane approach that is inherit in ethically raising livestock.  You nurture them, look after them, care for them.  In turn, they look after you.  
So you‚Äôre saying you eat corn stalks and alfalfa?  Both are extremely common fodder for livestock.
That's impossible. Everything I enjoy is the result of pain and suffering. I drive a car to go to the movies, I'm contributing to the pollution and death of our environment. I have the comfort of a home to return to, which is a freedom granted to me thanks to my government that kills innocent people to make sure I get to keep it. Evolution calls for a food chain, and for every predator there is a prey, and that prey is a predator. The truth is that most people are aware of these things, but they don't actually care, because their cells place preference in how good a burger tastes than trying to pacify the empathy that nags them in the back of their mind. So you pray, because it gives you console in a cruel world, and a sense that you are higher than I am, when really we're on the same level.
So extinction then.
No thanks.
Yeah but have they explicitly told you they don't enjoy it?

Also pretty sure the farmers hand goes in the vagina not the ass, because I've never got anyone pregnant using that hole.

Everything is fair game with humour.
Its not. I will admit fully and freely that it has big upfront barriers that might temporarily make it worse. But once the infrastructure is in place and the regular supply lines are established it is not at all, and any source telling you otherwise is being disingenuous.

An unsourced half page article making a claim with no sources is worthless even if it comes from MIT.


Read my comment again, please. You even quoted the relevant part. I said they‚Äôre *not* constantly torturing the cows (although I think many people would be surprised at how bad conditions actually are).
But you do hurt the cows intentionally. You kill them. And if killing them counts as looking after them or being humane, I don‚Äôt think I want you looking after me.
No, obviously I didn‚Äôt say that (although we can eat alfalfa sprouts). I also didn‚Äôt say we could eat grass or hay, in case there was any doubt about that.

But the reality is that most cows in the US are grain-fed, which means they‚Äôre eating foods based in soy and corn. We can eat both soy and corn. Either way, not having cows frees up a lot of crop land that we can use to grow a variety of plants.
Not all options cause the same amount of suffering, so pretending that all the options are equally bad doesn‚Äôt help anyone. Also, evolution doesn‚Äôt call for anything, it just is.
I mean... There are some easy steps that make huge contributions like take a bus instead of your car. Recycle. Consume less. Don't use animal products is the biggest contribution anyone can make. It reduces your footprint to 1/3 of what it was before.
yeah, we can stop artificially breeding them. they aren't wild animals. they don't fulfill an ecological niche
> Yeah but have they explicitly told you they don't enjoy it?

This is silly. Obviously we don‚Äôt need explicit communication with cows using language to understand that it‚Äôs unpleasant for them.

> Also pretty sure the farmers hand goes in the vagina not the ass, because I've never got anyone pregnant using that hole.

I‚Äôll let this instructional video from a farmer speak for itself:

[https://youtu.be/R6fYyxs_lDE](https://youtu.be/R6fYyxs_lDE) 
The source study is literally linked in the first sentence.
If you think artificial insemination equals constant torture and a violation of animal rights, what do you call the forced sterilization of spaying and neutering pets? Not to mention the act of locking an animal inside your house until they love you.

If you apply the same bullshit bad faith arguments to pet ownership as people like you do to farming, it's obvious that pet ownership is worse.
Farm animals actually do fulfill a niche in the ecosystem. There are about 1 million deer in NY state. In the US 120 million pigs & 39 million cows are used for food production. Using population percentage that‚Äôs roughly 7.25 million pigs and 2.36 million cows a year for the state. You remove the farm animals and the deer population is gone in months. 
How is it silly? Are you trying to tell me you know exactly how every cow feels and what there sexual desires are? I wouldn't think a guy would enjoy putting a jam jar up his ass would be enjoyable but I've seen seen the video
If you would stop putting words in my mouth for 30 seconds, you would realize that I have not said any of the things you‚Äôre accusing me of saying. Stop willfully misreading my comments about torture.
Why would the deer disappear if people stopped eating animal products?
[Here‚Äôs a better source](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/27/573774328/california-says-nestle-lacks-permits-to-extract-millions-of-gallons-of-water) since the Independent is not always a bastion of journalistic credibility.

*‚ÄùThe State Water Board says that of the 62.6 million gallons of water that Nestle says it extracted from the San Bernardino spring each year on average from 1947 to 2015, the company may only have a right to some 8.5 million gallons.

This is apparently related to Nestle‚Äôs Arrowhead label.

"California law does not prohibit private companies like Nestl√© from bottling the state‚Äôs water"

Why the fuck wouldn't a state who's known for suffering droughts clamp down on companies talking its water for personal profit?

Edit: getting quite a few replies saying way more water is wasted going towards growing almonds in a desert which is frankly moronic to do. All I can say to that is thank fuck I don't live in that basket place.
Nestle is a POS company. 

Edit: Well shit, thanks for the gold. 
Nestl√©, doing something deeply unethical?  [Well,](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/01/nestle-slavery-thailand-fighting-child-labour-lawsuit-ivory-coast) I'm [*shocked*.](http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestlefree)
this isn't new news, they've been sued loads of times for their practices surrounding their water. IIRC they were sued in the uk because they were selling standard tap water for a huge markup. 

[deleted]
Stop buying bottled water.  It's really that simple. 
Who knew that Mad Max would be such accurate foreshadowing?
This is wrong, but the quantities needed for bottled water production is dwarfed when compared to that used in agriculture. It is like blaming recreational fishermen of depleting global fish stocks. 
News flash: They've been doing that for 30+ years. Every so often they get yelled at for it somewhere, then they keep doing it.
Why in the hell is there a video of trump awkwardly drinking a glass of water with two hands halfway through the article? It literally has nothing to do with the subject matter?
> While California law does not prohibit private companies like Nestl√© from bottling the state‚Äôs water.

So Nestle is not doing anything illegal.
I say the same thing every time people bitch about Nestle or Monsanto.

BLAME THE FUCKEN GOVERNMENT that allows them to this.
Getting mad at a corporation for doing unethical shit is like getting mad at a lion for eating a gazelle. 

Democrats or Republicans are completely unwilling to hold corporate leaders responsible. 
The simple fix here is for the legislature of my state to change the laws on this. I don't know why that hasn't happened yet, unless it comes down to donations in which case shame on them.
[deleted]
Possibly stupid question but: why are people angry about this? I get that it is during a drought but it's ultimately being used for human consumption so I don't really see a problem. It's not like they're using it on large lawns or fountains or anything wasteful.

Also - how much water does nestle actually consume in comparison with domestic/other industry uses? Is it that significant?
As usual Reddit is making a mountain out of a molehill.  [According to the USGS](https://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/), each CA resident uses on average 181 gallons of water each day. If I'm doing the math correctly, at 39 million residents this is 7+ BILLION gallons each day. The State of CA is arguing that Nestle is using 54 million (not billion) gallons more than it should each YEAR. 

54 million gallons over a year is isn't going to make much difference in a state that uses 7 billion gallons each fucking day. 
If you buy individual bottled water from nestled at $1 you are an idiot. I only buy Fiji water for $5.
Has anyone seen the 2008 documentary [Blue Gold](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1137439/)? I honestly cannot recommend it enough. 
[Here‚Äôs](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1137439/plotsummary?ref_=m_tt_ov_pl#summary-ps0263048) the plot summary. Basically, there isn‚Äôt a drop of fresh water in the world that isn‚Äôt owned by some corporation or entity. It was very eye-opening for me back when I saw it.
Edit: 7.8 on IMDB. 
How much water are they taking?  Isnt it like a smutz compared to how much is actually there even with the drought?  Like if they shut down it would be equivilant of saving enough to water a farm for a few days?
It‚Äôs insane how much product comes through the nestle brand, but it‚Äôs possible to boycott. I‚Äôve done this since our provincial government (Ontario) pretty much let‚Äôs them have water for free despite most of us telling them that. 
Many places in the country, in the oldest sections of town, may still have lead goose neck services from the water main, like those in Flint. They function normally (and had been for 50+ years), until something as dramatic as (what happened in Flint) changing source waters, without changing their treatment technique. What happened in Flint is more about the management and DEP officials not doing their due diligence in drastically changing water composition and following suggested techniques. 

Going from a stable source ( lake reservoir), to the most fickle of water sources (river water), while doesn't seem a big deal to the layman (water is water, MIRITE?), The pH was different enough that it began corroding the scale built-up on the insides of the pipes, and eventually corroding the lead services, themselves. This is what caused the lead issue.

Hope this was helpful.
Ah yes, because the government owns the water. I guess I‚Äôll start charging rent for letting it be on my property.
This article and the responses show just how fucking stupid your average redditor is. 

The amount of water Nestle is using is miniscule in comparison to that used by agriculture, manufacturing and Californians as a whole.

But the oh-so-smart redditors (as they constantly tell you) are falling in line lockstep like the lemmings they are. The state points a finger at some small fry to take the fall and the masses get their pitchforks. Meanwhile the big abusers go on unimpeded. 

For example, each Californian uses an average of 181 gallons of water per day. That's 7.1 *BILLION* gallons of water used every day...and all of these morons are frothing at the mouth over 62 *MILLION*. Just like the politicians want. 
Jesus Christ. This is literally the plot of the Manga sandland
This is one of the many reasons I refuse to buy their products. Want to make your voice heard remember to vote with your money! Nothing works faster than hitting someone in the pocket!
In Ontario Canada as well..
Here we go again...

If someone else wants to collect, filter and bottle water at $3 per case be my guest. 

Almond farmers waste way more water than Nestle and in a much less needed industry. 

Bottom line is, even filtered tap water doesn‚Äôt taste great here and there is much more waste in other industries going on. On top of that CA has completely mismanaged water collection. We let millions of gallons run into the ocean during our last major rain and plans to conserve water ended up causing mains to burst and more water to be wasted. 

Stop with the ‚Äúmuh corporate‚Äù stuff. 
I shake my head every time companies take advantage of the misfortune of others to earn quick bucks.
Hmm, I tried to found out how much water California uses and I got this...

http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/

*How much water does California use each year?*

*It's a complicated question, but the U.S. Geological Survey now has an answer for 2010: 42 million acre-feet per year, or about 38 billion gallons per day.*

Obviously they use more water now.

And from the article.

*Ultimately, the board found Nestl√© had the right to about 26 acre-feet a year, or about 8.5m gallons, but had averaged some 192 acre-feet a year, or about 62m gallons.*

They probably shouldn't be taking more than their fair share (they are probably not the only company doing this), but this should put things into perspective.
The drought was officially declared over as of April 2017. 
http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article143321754.html
Read the article:  it's not like Nestle showed up with massive water trucks and started twirling its snidely whiplash moustache and sucked up all the water like a villain.

It cited 150-year old legal claims that were considered valid until a regulatory board decided it didn't, all of a sudden.

Maybe they've got a right to it and maybe they don't, this will probably go to court if Nestle figures it's worth the fight, but the headline (and a bunch of the top comments) seems to suggest something more sinister.
Here comes the Nestl√© hate train! Toot toot! 
They also use child labor in africa to harvest coco trees to make chocolate. If you think blood diamonds are bad, you should see what the chocolate industry is doing.  They claim to build schools and prohibit child labor, but they dont. Some of the kids are even slaves, kidnapped from 1000s of KM away. 
Wait,  California is back in a drought? Weren't they flooding like less than a year ago? 
Meanwhile, some civilians get fined for collecting rainwater. The world is a silly place
It's hilarious that anyone thinks there's anything we can do about this. We are fucking owned by these companies. Nothing will change, nothing will be done. Remember, in the US companies are people too.
people still buy bottled water? just put a filter on your tap if you're that concerned about additives. 
Considering this is the same company that was involved in the whole baby formula fiasco, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised. 
The invisible hand of the free market will sort this all out. People will stop buying water from Nestle if they don't like it. Or they'll stop buying water from California and just buy it from Nestle. Or the price will come down or go up depending on rain. Either way, if you don't like it just wait a couple of hundred years and it will all be balanced. Praise be to Ayn Rand.
This has been going on for years, after I saw the documentary about it I stopped purchasing their water. Everyone should do the same.
Sure nestle shouldn't be doing this.

Also how are people still saying CA is in a drought? We got record levels of moisture last winter. 

Source: lived in South lake Tahoe, got record snow in January. Shovelling a new 3ft of snow was a common occurrence.
62 million gallons per year is nothing, even in "drought-stricken" California.

Manufacturing plants in CA in total use ~~500~~ 400 million gallons per day. https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wuin.html

edit: here's a better link to the real report https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1405/pdf/circ1405.pdf, for the sake of comparison, agriculture in CA uses 24,261 millon gal/day
> Here‚Äôs a better source 

Is it a pun?
> since the Independent is not always a bastion of journalistic credibility.

Yet it remains the source that I see hit the front page the most on Reddit, by quite a bit probably.
It's like how children can't make dad punish mom for being mean to them. 

Citizens can't make the government punish corporations.

We need to brainstorm solutions if it's going to be non-stop exploitation.
Ahahahaha holy shit. That edit is primo, bro. 
After reading the article, which I would usually recommend as a good first step...

> While California law does not prohibit private companies like Nestl√© from bottling the state‚Äôs water

and 

> The board‚Äôs report isn‚Äôt the same as an enforceable order. It issued a series of recommendations for Nestl√© in a letter to the company, including suggesting the company ‚Äúcease any unauthorised diversions‚Äù, submit a compliance plan and secure a permit for diverting water beyond its allowance.

and

> Ultimately, the board found Nestl√© had the right to about 26 acre-feet a year, or about 8.5m gallons, but had averaged some 192 acre-feet a year, or about 62m gallons.

Nobody should be going to jail if it isn't against the law. Maybe the state should legislate something about this if it is a problem. Nestle should start following the recommendations of the board, and if they do not then further action should be taken. 

I say this even though I'm all for preserving natural resources and siding against large corporations.
[deleted]
Did you read the last paragraph? It's not illegal. It's recommended they stop, that's all. 
Lmao your edit is tops.
Yeah, they're politically well connected.
State of California is outraged after Nestle takes water from a much needed area and bottles it and sells it, state of California is castrated and stands by whimpering as all of this happens even though they could shut down this whole operation if they wanted to. 
They only reason they did it in the first place is because they knew they would get away with it.
Well the fine should be 150% of the profit generated from doing it. 
They also do this in Mexico. Meanwhile they're selling soda's for cheap. 
>  literally just leaves the tap on and let‚Äôs it flow into the ocean.

Can you provide a link?  
*lets - "let's" means "let us." 
What do you mean? Why would they do that?
If you have water rights to 8 million gallons, the state of california doesn't say "not for resale."
CA is clamping down...slowly. In 2014, e.g., Gov. JB signed the Sustainable Groundwater Mgmt. Act, which puts heavy restrictions on how GW basins are managed for overdraft and contamination. Previously, several regulatory measures administered by the SWRCB have dug the spurs into water quality control in agricultural production. With regard to sourcing, however, CA is still the Wild West, and no politician wants to be the unpopular sumbitch that drops the hammer on how unnecessarily complicated water rights law is. It‚Äôs a typical case of kicking the can down the road. For anybody interested in the biggest water fight in the history of CA, I recommend reading The King of California.
Individuals can go to jail for collecting rain water, but large corporations can collect AND sell it at no penalty. 
Most water in California (and really everywhere) is used for agriculture and industry.  Both of which are profit motivated.
Nestle is a bad company, and drinking bottled water is dumb.  However, I do not think it causes any measurable decrease in the water table here (I live in California):

Drinking water is usually less than 2% of water used. Agriculture uses 80%. People use 20% but of that, the majority goes to flushing toilets, showers, and leaks. Personal drinking water can only impact the water table by 2%.  Bottled water is a small subset of the 2%!

Also, if you bottle it in California and sell it to Californians who drink it, the water never left the state, right?  

In contrast, Agriculture (like rice and almonds) use up 80% of California‚Äôs water.  And MOST of that is exported for profit.  I think our outrage and efforts would be better used against the elephant in the room.

I mean this with the greatest respect, and I agree with the principle of what you're saying... 

> Why the fuck wouldn't a state who's known for suffering droughts clamp down on companies talking its water for personal profit?

But this? You can't afford to be this naive. You should know why.
Water is necessary for a lot of industries.  You can't even run a restaurant without water.  So it's not as if "water for profit" is some kind of great evil.  If they were using it for some purpose besides bottling it, people wouldn't make a peep.
Nestle uses practically no water compared to agriculture water use in CA.
Delta smelt. 
Better: you know for damn sure if you or I used that much water the cost would insane, and we'd likely face jail.. 
But God forbid you put a bucket outside to collect rain water. 
Because money
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say its got something to do with money in politics.
The article from yesterday was better. Basically detailing why California water rights are tricky, except it did downplay grandfathering practices. I think ultimately it will take a court to determine if Nestle has the rights or not, or new legislation on water rights.
It's not like the government itself is giving free water to people.
It‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll just keep the emergency drought restrictions going year round for everyone living in California. 

I hate opening up my water bill. Just with taxes and fees my bill is $180 before usage. I‚Äôll water my grass three times a week and my usage will be $20. It‚Äôs a scam. I would conserve a lot of water for you guys if you made it worth my while. 
The same reason your president gave 1.5 trillion to his rich buddies
Republicans, that's why 
>  companies ~~talking~~ *buying* its water for personal profit?

They don't get the water for free, they pay for it like any other person would.

If you really want to complain about companies wasting water look at the agriculture industry in California, Nestle is like a piss in a pond compared to them.




Because nothing makes sense in the US and profits are privatized 
[Nestle put this on their website and responded to me on Twitter with it](http://www.nestle-watersna.com/en/nestle-water-news/statements/swrcb-report-response) 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs it says: ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the report released by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) validates Nestl√© Waters‚Äô chain of title and reaffirms that we hold valid, pre-1914 surface water rights and groundwater rights to a significant amount of the water in Strawberry Canyon. We are pleased that they have confirmed we have a right to these ‚Äúauthorized diversions,‚Äù and we will continue to operate lawfully according to these existing rights and will comply fully with California law.  We look forward to cooperating with the SWRCB during the review process and to providing the necessary documents to supplement the SWRCB‚Äôs report, including producing information requested from over a century ago, to the extent that it is available. 
 
Arrowhead¬Æ Brand Mountain Spring Water has been sustainably sourced from the springs in what is now the San Bernardino National Forest for more than 120 years. We take our responsibility as a California water steward seriously, and our successful operations for more than a century point to our commitment to long-term sustainability.‚Äù
California resident here: can confirm most water is used for agriculture and industrial uses. Also - the state asked everone to cut back on water usage, we did, and know they are jacking up our water rates to make up for the revenue shortfall - we are paying more money to use less water. The same thing will happen to the cost of power as more people add solar panels. There is a fixed cost to paying for the utility infrastructure that must be paid for regardless of how much water or power is used.
Because bottling water barely uses any water, if you want to be angry then direct anger at the excessive agriculture in the state, you need thousands of kilos of water just to get a kilo of beef or fruit, for water you just need close to a kilo to get a kilo. 
I'm not quite so sure growing diamonds in a desert is moronic if it's making millions of dollars for the people doing it, as well as giving them more political influence (because of said money). 
The even bigger culprit are the RESNICKS.
They own POM, FIJI and Wonderful Pistachios

Why limit it to Nestl√©? Every single major food producer and supplier is a piece of shit company. It is because of these major companies colluding that I am forced, as a restaurateur, to buy from only them. I'm literally not allowed to buy from either the local grocery store, or from the farmers market because "they are not authorized distributers by the health department". No shit they aren't authorized, your authorization fee is thousands of dollars per year!
Nestle is not the only one. [Crystal Geyser](http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article159375254.html) wants to take our water, too. Look what happened when the French CEO didn't get what he wanted:

> Last year, Roseburg announced that it would not renew the 50-year lease. Adding to that shock was a visit from a Crystal Geyser corporate founder who demanded more water to fill plastic bottles for export. In a now-legendary tirade in which he said he would blow up the facility if he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted, the French billionaire threatened, among other things, to ‚Äúclose the plant and ‚Äòvomit,‚Äô ‚Äù Hall said.

Edit: This is taking place in Weed, California for anyone wondering.
On a personal level my dad used to work for them. Pro tip: don't. They cut back on his division and made him essentially work the jobs of 4 different people. It was awful and I'm still surprised the stress didn't give him a heart attack :(
Yep! Here in Canada they're allowed to outbid municipalities for natural water supplies. It's absolutely disgusting. 

(I'm on mobile so I'll try to provide a link later)
Nestl√© - it's French for cunt. 
I'd love to boycott them for this... but I've already been boycotting them for years. 
At this point if there was an award for the most predatory, unscrupulous company, Nestle would be a shoe in. Monsanto would be a close second though.
I had never seen these before. Bloody hell.
Nestle makes Monsanto look like saints
Sure were. Just standard tap water back into bottles. Sued for a lot less than they made as always.
Yes, I whole heartedly agree. 

City Hall: "Oh my lord, they took our water!"

Citizen: "Yeah, well... you let them."
I can relate. *cries in Illinoisan*
I‚Äôd love to use the tap water along with my fridge except that I moved into an apartment where there is no water hookup for the fridge in the kitchen. The tap water is very hard and I can‚Äôt drink it unfiltered.

Do you know if there exists something that will allow me to run a water line from the kitchen sink to the fridge? 
My girlfriend's family constantly buys bottled water.  I hate it.  We had to buy some because we were hosting Christmas.  The worst part is, all were used up, but hardly any we're finished.  A good third of them still had more than half full.  What a waste.

I will say, I think it's because they all live in the Baltimore area, but that's what filters and the large jugs are for.  If you have to buy it bottled, at least be cost effective.

Edit: not saying that Baltimore water is bad, just what the perception is.

>Stop buying ~~bottled water.~~ all of the products made by Nestle:

 http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestle-boycott-list
I live in Jacksonville, Florida. No amount of filtering, boiling, or flavoring is going to make our water taste decent. We like bottled water here.
Come drink my disgusting well water.
The water in my apartment smells slightly like rotten eggs and leaves yellow/brown residue on my shower curtain after just 3 days (I wash it weekly). It's also cloudy and it's not bubbles. I've let it sit and it doesn't settle. Tell me how to fix it and I'll stop buying bottled water. Moving isn't an option. Filtering it doesn't seem to help.
> It's really that simple.

No it isn't.  
That water is also in their soda. So you'd have to stop drinking soda, too. Not just soda, but any beverage that contains water.  
  
In order to not facilitate companies selling water out of state, you'd have to give up drinking anything other than local tap water.
yeah, but i can't turn on a faucet and get fruits and vegetables.

edit: spelling
It's not that they want to stop them from bottling the water, it's that the state wants more money to do it. 
I highly recommend you read The King of CA for a story about how not simple that solution is. It‚Äôs a good chronicle of major state and federal attempts to curtail unbridled use of water in CA via legislation and the major $ influences that have won instead.
Yeah but the cows are drinking bottled water these days
I feel Nestle is probably an easy target for local protestors and politicians, even if they deserve it. I've done the numbers and they alone, don't really have an impact anyone would notice...
>54 million gallons over a year is isn't going to make much difference in a state that uses 7 billion gallons each fucking day. 

No one really gives a shit about the water.  Environmental activists don't like BOTTLED WATER.  Instead of trying to ban bottled water, they are trying to make it more difficult for the bottled water companies to operate.  However, the end result of their efforts will simply be that water will have to be transported farther around the state in diesel trucks, which will end up being worse for the environment.

The article says they are taking 62m gallons a year.

California needed at least 38 billion a DAY back in 2010.

^Interesting article, btw. Most water already goes to agriculture, not some childish cliched version of 'Evil Corp'. Not hard to find a story once you get past the emotional clickbait.
> How much water are they taking?

Basically nothing compared to overall water use in California.

> Like if they shut down it would be equivilant of saving enough to water a farm for a few days?

Probably wouldn't even cover how much water Californians use to flush their toilets on a single day.


Ontario negotiated such a stupid contract with them in terms of the contractual compensation, that someone must have been paid off.
Also reminds me of Rango.
It's kinda hard not to buy Nestle products. The number of brands they own is ludicrously vast, and decent chance you accidentally bought many nestle products without even realizing it. 
Your chiropractor must be frustrated
That incentive is built into the system - externalize costs and profit goes up.  The root of all our corporate problems if you ask me.
This section was a graveyard until your two cents -- thanks from a hydrologist
Not in CA, but the place I work at will use over 4 million per day at times.  We average around 2 million per day on an annual basis.  This is just one place.  
Yeah, I remember something along this line the last several times this Nestle thing came up.  It uses something like half a percent of the total water used in Cali, maybe less, and people act like they are using 50% of it.  The vast majority of water is used by the ag industry and winderies.
> on average from 1947 to 2015

I think this is a key phrase and a downplay by Nestle. Averaging in decades before the bottled water craze took off is an attempt to hide how much they're currently taking. The bottled water industry is currently growing about 10% a year over the last decade alone
This comment needs to be higher. While it may not be "right" for Nestle to be doing it, it's not really destroying the lives of Californians. People who buy bottled water are going to continue to do so. Especially in a state with a drought. Manufacturing uses loads more on the daily and people don't bat an eye. You pay for convenience
It comes as no suprise that the only comment in this thread with an ounce of credibility is half way down the page.
Water you talking about?
Fines need to be far more aggressive for companies that are "too big to fail".  Instead of a single one time fine of $xxx,000 make the fine based on company income (5-30% based on severity of infraction) and make it payable every quarter for a year.  Fines are treated as a cost of doing business rather than an incentive to not do shady shit.  We need to make it so fines affect their bottom line.
How about not buying nestle water.  Social media campaign nation wide to boycott bottled water.

Because they know the power the citizen holds so they mastered the art of controlling those citizens through propaganda

Even here on this website we can find those people who have been indoctrinated and are currently loudly cheering about a massive corporate tax break which creates trillions+ in debt that they're on the hook for 
[removed]
Regulating corporations is supposed to be one of the primary functions of a government.
What about a class action lawsuit? The class here being every citizen of California.
If the fines dwarfed the profit they make from breaking laws, these organisations would quickly change their behaviour...

But this will never happen until you get money out of politics.
Bad metaphor. Citizens can and should punish corporations
Except they didn't say they don't have a right to any water, they said they don't have a legal right to all the water. 

"After combing through decades worth of permitting information, the water board declared last week that the company had no basis for much of the water it was draining from the Strawberry Canyon watershed. It said the company‚Äôs invocation of David Noble Smith was ‚Äúnot valid for Nestl√©‚Äôs current appropriative diversion and use of water from the San Bernardino National Forest‚Äù."

California also had state wide drought restrictions with fines during the drought (https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/15/us/california-drought-water-restrictions/index.html). Couldn't find numbers on a quick Google and am not familiar with California law, but that *should* apply not only to homeowners but also private industry (what good is putting restrictions on lawn watering when a bottling company can simply extract all the water they want and ship it anywhere they want?). 
And put them in jail. They don‚Äôt just take the profits of drug dealers, they put them in jail. They even put the drug users in jail. If these execs actually faced hard sentences they‚Äôd be much less likely to do these things. 
In the European Union they fine % of revenue for Competition breaches.

5% of that hurts anyone, even giants like Volkswagen or Apple.
This is the problem.
Then the title is wrong, if they have no right it is illegal. If it is not illegal, they have the right to do it.
I've been reading through the responses trying to find the best comment as a reply. Here's my favorite so far: 

> $100 fine per 8 ounce class of water.
Does your government let them take it all for free too?
There was a scandal in London a few years back over this too. Peckham Springs it was called, and no one ever found out what plonker was behind it. 
Apparently not, seems like it isn't true.
But a tax on bottling could be beneficial for citizens 
That's different from a ballpark of 126 million.
JB = Jerry Brown

GW = Ground Water

SWRCB = State Water Resources Control Board
I mean, politicians are somewhat constrained by the fact that the water rights were already sold and are now private property. The State can't just say 'backsies' and revert it all to their management. 

It's not just unpopularity, it's the consequence of previous decades' policy that ties their hands today.
You can't collect rain water?
Definitely agreed. People pretend that California is just two big cities surrounded by suburbs, but it's really a massive agricultural state that needs a lot more water than it should. 
This is what pisses me off about the political signs I see on farms driving down highway 99... "since when is growing food wasting water?"

No one is saying that you fuckwit, but when residential water usage only account for ~10% of water of usage in the entire state and we are being asked to cut our consumption by 30-50%, its ony fair to ask the biggest users to cut back their usage as well. 

Like maybe we shouldn't be growing fucking almonds in a fucking desert, ever think of that you stupid fuckwits?
Nestl√©‚Äôs usage amounts to 1/227,710 of Cali‚Äôs water consumption, so significantly less than 2%.
yep about exporting. I used to buy california almonds in China for the same price I could buy them for in california 
How do we know that the bottled water stays only in California and doesn‚Äôt get distributed to other states? 
This is the thing that gets me. Bottled water is used as drinking water. It‚Äôs not like people are washing their cars or watering their laws with the stuff. If we got everyone to stop drinking bottled water and start drinking tap water it would be a net ZERO difference in water use. 

Not defending bottled water. It‚Äôs a stupid waste of resources. Water just happens to NOT be one of the resources that‚Äôs wasted. 
Also I'm happy to point out that people (people like my mom for instance) bitch about getting produce from countries in tropical regions rather than getting produce from the good old US of A. You know, tropical regions that aren't deserts and that still have year-round growing seasons. So if we're not getting produce from elsewhere in the world, where are we getting it? California, I suppose. How are we doing that? By sucking the state dry. Some of that water inevitably leaves the state in the produce itself. 

And obviously, **Nestle is a bad company and has done awful things in the past and continues to do awful things and this is another awful thing that they're doing, seriously, what the fuck, Nestle?** But it's more of a comfort for people to avoid thinking about the impact they're all having en masse by demanding produce from California year-round and happily buying produce grown in a fucking desert. 
> Also, if you bottle it in California and sell it to Californians who drink it, the water never left the state, right?
> 
> In contrast, Agriculture (like rice and almonds) use up 80% of California‚Äôs water. And MOST of that is exported for profit. 

Arrowhead is sold nationally. So it's not just Californians drinking it. In fact, it's probably "most" in the similar sense that most agriculture is exported.

Also, the issue isn't whether the water leaves the *state*, but that it leaves the area it's meant to water. I have water restrictions so the Bay area can have enough water. If I have water restrictions because you are bottling it *and* the Bay area needs it, well, that ticks me off more than the previous sentence. I'm pretty sure people in SB that get restrictions so that LA can have water would feel the same way. 

Also, it may be a small drop in CAs overall bucket, but again we are talking regionally about a company where *86.3%* of it's water is found to be illegally gathered...  *53.5m gallons* is enough for a few households to not get water restrictions...
Yep, this is a stupid issue for stupid people. It's not based on any logical water management problem, it "OH MY GOD THEY ARE SELLING OFF OUR  WATER DURING A DROUGHT!" 

Meanwhile a golf courses are using the same amount of water as the bottling plant so that when people hit little white balls they roll differently. 
I‚Äôd like to point out that it doesn‚Äôt take that much effort to avoid their products, either.  They have a lot of brands in a lot of categories, but it‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt buy candy bars and cereal from someone else.  Take a couple seconds out to look it up, be an informed consumer.  You already have to go to the store anyway, why not do it like a smart person in a way that doesn‚Äôt support monsters?
They also knowingly profit from child slavery. Check out documentary "the dark side of chocolate".
Weed is my hometown.  There is currently a lawsuit by the City which is trying to reestablish its water rights from Roseburg Forest Company who is trying to make residents pay for usage of the water (above and beyond their monthly utility fee) that is already theirs in the first place.  Crystal Geyser pumps water from a natural spring that is part of the city's water source at an alarming rate for pennies on the gallon and sells it to Japan making an outstanding profit.  Residents now realize this is causing drought in the mountain community where lakes and streams no longer can replenish themselves and contribute the lack of water flowing to the South.  Several years ago a fire burnt down a large portion of the community due to drought conditions (started by an arson related fire) leaving thousands homeless and Crystal Geyser didn't pitch in, not even by providing clean bottled water to desperate residents.
How does vomiting help anything?
So what happened? Did he blow anything up?
Nestle or not - That‚Äôs pretty common these days unfortunately. 
I'd say it's a tie. Just different types of fucked up shit

Why not just get a separate filter, not relying on the one in the fridge? Like a pitcher filter or one that attaches directly to the sink faucet, then just fill some glass bottles and keep them in the fridge if you like it cold. Technically you could split off of the line to the sink, but I don't think you'd want to do that in a rental apartment.

Use the unfinished water bottles to water your plants. :)
I don't know how it is in other countries but in Belgium water from the tap is most of the time safer then bottled water since it is more regulated and more quality control.
I live in Baltimore County. There is nothing wrong with the water. 
I live in Baltimore, we have great water.  [Ranked 10th best public water in the nation.](http://bestlifeonline.com/best-drinking-water/)

Edit: Lead is still a problem in low-income neighborhoods here (pipes and paint), but there's not a ton the government can do for that.  In order to rent out a house you need a lead inspection first, so rentals are safe, but family homes that have been passed generation to generation are an issue.
Baltimore city and county have some of the best drinking water in the country...
Pretty much all beverages contain water so yeaj
KenM right here 
I only eat beef that drinks Fiji water exclusively.
It's funny to me that this news is posted every few months. The amount of water used by California daily is no where near the amount Nestle takes yearly. 62 million/(38 billion x 365 days) = 0.000447**%** of California's yearly water.
It's not all that hard. Just find graphic chart of Nestl√© brands, see which you use to buy and cut it out.  



For me that was Nestea, Garnier and Purina. Don't buy those anymore.
Contrary to that, he's laughing to the bank making big bucks off his regular customer. It's a conspiracy I tell you.
Professional water engineer in California checking in... I too hate when this issue comes up because almost nobody on Reddit knows what the hell they're talking about and are just looking for some reason to get up in arms about Nestle.
I used to try and reason with people when they'd get all up in arms about water bottling in CA and how incredibly pointless attacking them is in terms of CA's water problems. Too lazy to re-check my numbers, but going from memory, a given bottling plant uses something like the same water every year as 10,000 average CA households use in a *day.* But *Evul Corporation* is a nice safe target for CA politicos to attack and look like they're doing something.
[deleted]
And in a year nestle's california bottling operation uses equivalent to 0.02% of what LA alone uses in a year.

Getting angry about water bottling in california is like fussing over a dripping tap when you have a water fall right next to it. 
Repeat offenses should incur geometric fines. Should be the standard for all criminal misconduct for businesses.
~~CEO's~~ Board members need to be held accountable for their companies. Jail time plain and simple. Fuck fines. 
i dont understand how for normal crime the punishment is always an order of magnitude more painful than the benefit of getting away from it while for corporate bullshit its the opposite
If we make them pay too much l, these companies will just start firing employees to balance it out. No exec will ever take a pay cut.

Execs need to be held accountable with either personal fines or long jail time in state prison. Not that fancy hotel upscale prison for rich people
This sounds like a good idea but some industries operate with very small margins. So small that a percentage based fine will actually make the company go under or lead to significant number of layoffs. People who are elected, don't like sudden spikes of unemployment in their constituencies after a decision they make.

Your answer to this might simply be "tough" and that companies should follow the law then. It's hard to disagree with that but it's also hard to explain to a random newly unemployed middle-manager with kids to feed why a decision made 5 levels above him in the hierarchy now causes his kids to miss meals.
My mother boycotted Nestle while we were growing up because of many infant deaths it has caused in underdeveloped countries https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott
People have been trying that with Nestle quite literally since the '70's.  It doesn't work.  We simply can't get enough people onboard to make a significant difference.

You literally can't.

They are Hydra. For every brand you boycott, they own 3 more that you are buying. Especially if you want to boycott everything Nestle. 

This is one of the reasons major corporations can operate with such impunity, and a major reason normal people are at such a disadvantage to mega corporations. You only have one name, one face, one credit history, and one social security number.
This is what needs to happen.  
When was the last time you actually bought a bottle of water? I'd wager most of these purchases are done in bulk by corporations so that you get a free bottle of water with your lunch, or something like that. You don't exactly get a choice I those cases.

The only time I actually purchase water is in foreign countries where either the tap water is dangerous, or their culture doesn't seem to like tap water outside the home (wtf Europe?).
Voting with your wallet doesn't work.  Too many people don't give a shit.  Very few people actually vote with their wallets, and it's one of those things that only works at scale; most media outlets are either directly or indirectly corporate controlled; for many goods and services, only people of a certain means are even capable of voting with their wallets, because it necessitates having a cash surplus.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands#Water

Good luck with that. You'll notice this list isn't complete and that Nestle owns some 8,500 brands.
Yea! Eat the rich!

Well, there's your problem.  
In this case the water is already publicly owned.

VW fines were laughable in Europe. The US buttfucked VW in comparison. The EU only fines US companies like that.
Exactly. The title is incorrect. 
My parents live in Mexico. The villages near them don't have access to clean water. Yet there is a coke bottling plant in almost every region. I think coke has colluded with the government to force people to buy their products by preventing them to have access to clean water. 
Who do you think is gonna pay that tax? 
CA = California
I stand corrected. Before 2012, it was illegal to capture rain water. However, in 2012, California‚Äôs Rainwater Recapture Act allows citizens to capture water from their roof and what not. This was established to assist in dependency during droughts. 

[Lexus Nexus Citation](https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/top-emerging-trends/b/emerging-trends-law-blog/archive/2013/02/04/california-s-rainwater-recapture-act-lets-state-residents-capture-use-harvested-rainwater.aspx) 
You can't in many places because it messes with the the water.. Table? That is probably not the right word.

So some point i took water policy in grad school and this was explained... Probably a decade ago lol
Texas has right of capture. If water goes into your property it's yours as much as you can hold and if your neighbors get screwed over then so be it. Only in times of extreme drought may the government step in. 
Some places it is illegal to, yes. Others it not only isn't illegal it is encouraged. 
Many people don't realize that CA as a state, has the 6th largest economy in the world.
If almonds aren't grown in California, they effectively disappear from store shelves around the world.

Meanwhile, other states experience cataclysmic floods every other year that just drain to the ocean. 
The problem with your argument is that growing crops like almonds in the desert is a good idea. It gives you better control over the watering schedule and the temperatures are relatively consistent. Plus water that doesn't evaporate or get used by the plant trickles back into the water table. If you want to have a problem with fruit and nut growers have a problem with the ones using sprinklers or flood irrigation on trees. Drip irrigation will use more water but it's more efficient application. You will get larger yeilds per gallon and have less evaporation loss. 
Things like water and soda are too heavy and too inexpensive to ship very far. It‚Äôs why every metro area has its own bottling plant. Coke isn‚Äôt made in Atlanta. The syrup may be, but generally it‚Äôs mixed with local water and bottled/canned probably within 50 miles of where it‚Äôs ultimately consumed. Bottled water is similar. 
Water is not that "dollar dense" so it makes no economic sense to transport huge quantities of water that is pretty heavy over long distances and eat the additional cost that is a significant fraction of the value of the cargo itself.  
Most bottled water is locally sourced so the logistics costs are minimal.


Random fun fact about growing stuff in deserts by "mining" aquifers: Saudi Arabia farmed wheat for exactly 30 years and it came to an end FOREVER last year (2016) because they have mined their thousand year water reservoir and now it's gone.

Reddit is run by child slaves of the suburbs.
I wrote a paper in high school called 'Hedonism in America'. How eating chocolate is akin to supporting child slavery and sexual abuse all over the globe. It's disgusting. Good documentary too!
Yeah I live in the county next door. Been following the story for quite a while. It's scary and sad. 
Not physically. It's been a whole thing, though. So the town of Weed was owned by Roseburg, the timber comapny. They built it for their employees. Eventually it became its own city and Roseburg was leasing the water to the city for $2/year, and that lease expired in 2016.  That's when Crystal Geyser pulled this stunt, because Roseburg didn't want to lease water to the city anymore and they could sell it to Crystal Geyser who was demanding more water for the plant. 

There is apparently a document that exists from 1982 proving that the water rights were sold to the city. It allocates a specific part of the water rights to Weed and the rest for industrial purposes for the company. This is currently being used in a lawsuit against Roseburg, but Roseburg is now backed by Crystal Geyser so it's kind of hard to actually get the rights back.

We tried that with one of those brita tap filters but it wasn‚Äôt enough filtering to make the water not taste funny.

I meant more along the lines of running a water line from the top itself to the fridge, like a cheap pvc or something, not necessary splitting the line that currently goes to the kitchen sink. 
Yeah man... Baltimore has been recognized as having some of the best water in the nation. Don‚Äôt be slandering us. 
Most of Europe is like this. Tap water is perfectly safe and nobody doubts drinking it. I have never given it a second thought anyway. 
They fear it.  I think it's just the stigma of Baltimore.
Hey, sorry if this is off topic, but it's something I've always been curious about ‚Äì Why does California seem to have such crippling shortages of water compared to other desert states that get less rain than most of SoCal?  I've grown up in Arizona but I don't recall ever being asked to not water my lawn or wash my car because of drought.
> almost nobody on Reddit knows what the hell they're talking about and are just looking for some reason to get up in arms

Right? I used to work Colorado where Nestle has another facility and as I was checking the permit I was like yuuuup.... Everything is in order here... Anyone can do what they're doing

Regardless of the relative magnitude, is it not still an issue they are profiting off selling water they have no rights to? Sure the ‚Äúdrought-ridden‚Äù aspect of the story, and implying this water would make ant difference is sensationalist at best, but there‚Äôs still underlying issues to be addressed. 
Well California IS drought-stricken, and SoCal is especially dry, so it at least matters to the environment of the San Bernardino mountains. Plus, a large portion of that water is being exported to other states and little of that money is going into CA's coffers, if 80% of it is unlicensed. CA should be importing water, if anything.
geometric fines ? 
Like triangles at first but add more sides each time you screw up?
Shit if they treated it like my pothead buddy they'd be fucked hard after the third time... Too bad cheddar wasn't an exec to a billion dollar company :(
#freecheddar
There should not only be % based fines AND jail time for executives, but an additional fixed per-share fine that gets passed along to *every* *single* shareholder.

I.e. 
Company pays X% fine.
Executives go to jail.
Each shareholder pays $X for every share they own of the offending company.

Yeah but there's no amount of "restructuring" that can make up for the kind of fines people are talking about here.  If you fire enough people to alleviate the financial burden of the fines, now you don't have enough of a workforce to operate.  
Put the fines into unemployment and welfare programs, pay out to people laid off.

Businesses might stop breaking the law if it means being shut down and all their income going to the people they screwed over in the first place.
In Sweden, this is acknowledged, but the economists I studied under highlighted this as a benefit to the economy overall, as failing razor margin businesses clears up money, real estate, resources and niches to be used for companies and individuals that operate more effectively (have bigger margins - a razor-margin company is essentially considered a doomed resource hog that should rather go under or innovate sooner rather than later to minimize the loss of resources spent carrying them on their last legs).

This means the guy whose kids are missing meals is more likely to get a higher paying job in the long term instead of living on thinner and thinners margins towards a starvation wage.
Realistically, if a business operates on razor thin margins, even with extralegal or illegal practices, that business is probably not providing a net positive to society. Most likely having the resources such a company was sucking up available for other purposes will be more efficient and effective at providing opportunity for workers and valuable products and services for consumers. 
Innocent people are always going to be in the crossfire for any decision. Whether these companies are purposely using Innocents as a personal shield is unknown to me, but I hear this argument a lot when it come to punishing businesses. It's tough, and the decision doesn't warm the heart, but truly punishing these busnisses will help more people than hurt. Afterall, even if innocent people do get laid off, they don't have degrees in "chocolate mixing" from Nestle, these are hard working people with experience that should translate to other places of employment. 
If BoD members went to jail when the company broke the law there would be a lot more oversight and a lot less law breaking.
Me and my Mother still do.
It doesn't help that Nestle is a lot bigger than many people realize. They own a lot of brands, they're behind many generic labels, etc.
Do it anyway if you can. That's my policy. I hate them with a passion for their numerous scummy ways and I'm sure I'm still somehow supporting them by buying something I don't yet know is affiliated with them but I refuse to be a zombie consumer. There will always be people who boycott better than me, but if I see Nestle logo, I don't buy.  
But just boycotting or not buying some products would still hit their profits from that product.
I grew up in Northern California in the 7 year drought of the 90‚Äôs. I remember my mom switching us to all bottled water because the quality of tap got so poor during the drought. Usually Safeway generic brand in the giant jugs, Arrowhead was for rich folks.

The state has had plans for years to build a pipe to funnel Northern CA water down to Southern CA. Meanwhile they‚Äôre bending over backwards to sell their water to corporations down there, so they can sell it back to citizens. Unbelievable. 
10 years of mandatory 20 hours per week civil service, or maybe 1 hour for every bottle sold that came from the source? oh and to be clear, this goes to the entire board. They're responsible for the company, they do the time.

edits: to add clarity and certainty.
The means of production in this case would be Nestle's bottling plants. 
Embargo the streams, creeks and rivers!

Edit: but for real, I'd fully support a civilian pushback against this where regular people just go and destroy those plants.
If you think America has a left, I'd say the propaganda worked on you.
This part of the article really gets me:

> Conservatives and business groups say class actions are a form of regulation through litigation and insert courts into matters better left to administrative bodies.

Gee, these are the same groups who have been undermining and even dismantling administrative bodies over the years. It's not a question of methodology or procedure, they're basically trying to shut down every avenue for peaceful redress that the general public has available to it.
You're half right. The fines in US were more related to offending emission regulations, not so much regarding competition. I can't find thr exact numbers now.
That‚Äôs horrible, it would be interesting to see just how far this stretches.
Mexico has one of the worst obesity rates especially when considering their GDP. That is most countries with obesity problems are very wealthy. Saw an article don't remember where but they had pictures of the groceries that a typical family from each country eats each week and some of the more impoverished countries had a family sitting by a few bags of rice and limited meat and vegetables.

One thing that struck me was that the Mexican family was over weight but also that they had so much Coca-Cola products in their groceries while most of the rest of their groceries looked pretty healthy. Fruits and veggies. I'm convinced that soft drinks are the PRIME culprit for obesity along with inactive lifestyles. 

Found the link. Not sure if this is the original story but it's got all the same pictures. https://fstoppers.com/food/what-week-groceries-looks-around-world-3251

I think they‚Äôre doing the same thing in Brazil. My Brazilian friend refuses to drink anything but coke 24/7. She was surprised when I told her most Americans don‚Äôt even drink pop anymore.
I just came back from Mexico. It was interesting to see a trailer with a few hundred 5 gallon bottles of purified water. Those bottles were likely shipped from GDL to a city south of us. GDL is at least a two hour drive from us plus the time to whatever city the water was being transported. With the bottles also having to be returned when empty, those bottles spent at least 8 hours on the road. 

A 5 gallon bottle of water in MX costs about 60 cents USD.

How does this even make economical sense?
Consumers who waste money on bottled water?
It's= it is

What was the justification for this law? It sounds very tyrannical.
In those stupid flyers the send us about conserving our water it tells us we can't collect rain water. I remember being mad until I googled it and it said because of the mosquito issue. Maybe it's still the law in some areas?
That's correct. 

In Colorado you can't collect rain water because California owns the water.
Water cycle

Yet paving a parking lot for 3,000 cars is just ignored
I always thought it was because people couldn‚Äôt be trusted to keep the collected water clean and covered, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Water table is the correct word. It's the upper surface of ground water saturation areas
Where I am, rainwater capture qualifies as "best practice" which gets you a credit on your water bill.  Works great for watering gardens.

Other things that qualify you for the credit are volunteering to plant trees where people have requested them, or volunteer hours for a few different environmentally focused non-profits.

But seriously, just go to a hardware store and look what connectors fit together. You can learn a lot very quickly if you just try.
Hasn‚Äôt it been proven that bottled water is the same if not worse than most major US city public water? Obviously taking the few exceptions out. I thought there was a water documentary, maybe ‚ÄúBottled‚Äù that discussed it.
Most of the US is like this.  Tap water may taste off depending on the mineral content, but it‚Äôs almost always safe to drink.  I had to put in the almost because of what the incompetent government of Flint Michigan did recently. 
Most of the first world is like this.  People are just obscenely lazy and can‚Äôt be bothered to hold a glass under a tap for a few seconds.
Who fears it?  The people who live there or the OP?
95% of it is politics. Yes our reservoirs got low in recent years but it had nothing to do with people watering their lawns or taking long showers. Politicians make a big deal of those things because they're an easy target. Passing regulations about in-home water use like low flow appliances and fixtures makes them look like they are doing something and makes people feel like they're helping. It's all lip service.
Yeah but Arizona and California have different politics, so what you are or are not asked to do doesn't necessarily reflect the state of water availability as much as attempts to regulate usage.  Plus all of the agriculture in California has very few regulations on water, so while I don't know about Arizona I think that much of California water goes to things like berries, almonds, etc.
Industrial farming is the elephant in the room here.

First fine $y. Second fine $y*x. Third fine $y*x^2. Fourth fine $y*x^3 etc. Multiply by scale favor every time. (as opposed to arithmetic mean, where you ADD by scale factor every time)
Probably like a dynamic fine. Your starting fine is based of company value/profit and each infraction grows quickly/exponentially to really force everyone to pay attention.
Fines in all shapes and sizes 
Judgement: 20 years Iso-Cube
Logarithmic fines?
You've been dodecahedroned mutha fucker!
Yes basically, and then when it gets to an octagonal fine they'll really be in hot water.
(rolls a d20 for fine)
The issue with fines is that CEOs can just pass the hurt from them down to their employees. "No Christmas bonuses this year, thank the federal government." Putting a fine on stocks is hurting the company which hurts jobs. "Nestle" isn't just the board or the CEO, it's also all the middle and lower class employees just trying to get by who had nothing to do with these decisions.

Corporations are not people, and we need to stop acting like they are in every facit of life, not just in politics. "Nestle" is not doing this, the board members are.

Individuals are doing this shit, theyre the ones making the executive decisions, the individuals should be punished in a way that directly hurts *them* in a lasting fashion. Not the company that they work for, *them*. They need to lose their freedoms or at the very least their wealth and not be able to shift that punishment around to others or escape it.
I own very little stocks but in quite a few companies and I'm just a random dude. Do I have to pay fines if the companies in my stock portfolios commit crimes?

Edit: I agree we need to be harsh with these companies. Hefty fines that the company will actually feel, jail time for executives, stricter regulations and more oversight. The shareholders should be ashamed and feel the burn for the companies crimes. 

I however don't agree that every person that happens to own stock in a company should get direct fines. Most have no part in the crimes. If we wanna fine let's say shareholders that have 5% or more that'd more reasonable to me. Or shareholders that have voting rights. But people who invest in order to actually have a retirement? That's only gonna hurt the working class. 
The shareholder portion can‚Äôt ever happen. That removes the principle of limited liability from the investors and you be the end of every company that gets a fine. Also why punish someone who had nothing to do with the action? That‚Äôs like punishing the mail room clerk for an oil spill. 
An additional fine to shareholders is unnecessary. The whole point of the larger percentage based fine is to hit their earnings and cash flows. That already has a direct impact on the value of the shares and a loss to the common shareholder. Besides, your average joe invested in a company like that realistically isn‚Äôt entirely in touch with everything the company is doing and has no say in how the company operates. So many retail investors just buy shares of big corporations and then let it rest for a while. 
That's ridiculous, not every shareholder is involved in criminal wrongdoing. How can you fine people who have been found guilty of nothing? A lot of the time shareholders are actually the ones getting screwed over the hardest by corporate crime in the first place. Next you'll be saying we should just convict people without trial.
That's basically illegal. Shareholders have limited liability. They can't be held liable for company's liabilities. 
If you want the whole fucking economy to fail thats how you do it, making shareholders responsible for the company's actions. There is a reason that corporations are a seperate entity.
Shareholders may not of approved the behavior though. 
Then the company shuts down and a new one takes it's place that doesn't break the law. That's the whole point of Capitalism. Slap Nestle with a $10BN fine and I bet Dasani won't do that shit.
I think that's the idea: operate within the rules or don't operate.  This is a non-essential retail business.  The world will be just fine without it.  If you take a job at a shady outfit, you should be factoring the likelihood that it's going to be shut down at some point into that decision.
I like this solution.

I also think that you could punish them by directly limiting their ability to source water from sources they don't own.

I know that it's a drop in the ocean but I've been doing my utmost to avoid buying nestle products for a while ever since I found out they were [fucking over a town in Ontario ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/report-on-business/nestle-outbids-small-ontario-municipality-to-buy-well-for-bottled-water/article31999831/) taking their water from them and also their [deliberately misleading campaigns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl√©_boycott) saying their formulas are better than breast milk. Fuck bottled water and fuck Nestle in the ass.
and there's a lot of apathetic buyers... even if you hear about a problem like this and feel empathetic about it, for a lot of people they hear this in the media about every brand they buy and become disenfranchised. combined with the fact that nestle and other companies have an insane amount of related and subsidiary companies and even if they stopped another company could simply take their place and a lot of people feel like their boycott wouldn't be worth it.
[Here's a good list to start with.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands) When someone I know regularly buys these brands I try to inform them of how disgusting Nestle is and suggest better options. It may be difficult at the start, but it doesn't take long to remember most of the major brands under them. 
I think we would see an influx of people being paid to use a fake ID and perform service hours for other individuals at an hourly rate.
It was used as part of the crime, so couldn‚Äôt it be taken under the same civil asset forfeiture that cops use to steal from individuals? After all, a corporation is a person.
It's also just becoming a health epidemic because Mexicans( and a lot of the rest of the world), are addicted to sugar- the obesity rates are increasing. 
[deleted]
Americans still drink a lot of soda. And even those that don't are probably drinking a lot *lot* of sugar. Fruit juice (for example) has more sugar in it than soda, your latte from Starbuck, or that smoothie you get to be "healthy".

My favorite is my boss, who will comment about my soda consumption, usually has an energy drink every morning. 
Hey not fair what am I supposed to do drink out of the sink!?!?/s
I'd agree, but with the state of some lead laden utilities I'd understand if people didn't trust drinking from taps. Rock and a hard place. 
I mean it's not like you can spend days without potable water do to a massive wildfire ting?
Guy not every one has clean water from the tap. In fact millions have heavy metals in their drinking water.
Hey buddy, bottled water is my only option for clean drinking water. 

I live in an unincorporated neighborhood with only well water, and all around us are commercial and light industrial shops and the runoff they pour into our water table. 

It is literally unsafe to drink, and we have a giant-assed water system just to make it so that it isn't super harmful when we shower in it. 

So we get those 5 gallon jugs because it is a health hazard to drink our local water. 

JSYK there are people who depend on bottled water as their only potable source. 

And before you say 'get a britta or something', the only way our water can be rendered potable is via reverse osmosis...
Yes, filters are a thing, but consider this: much of the water being bottled is coming from Yosemite. Nearly every public water source in the adjacent San Joaquin Valley has terrible water. Things haven't changed *too* much from the Erin Brokovitch days
Flint, MI....
Doesn't seem as wasteful when there's arsenic and hexavalent chromium in your sink water.  
e.g. = exempli gratia
Thanks :P
Someone up hill could set up a collection array that would prevent water from running to peoples property downhill 
Standing water can breed lots of nasty critters. This law is much like others which are meant to ‚Äúprotect us of from ourselves‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs a lowest common denominator thing
>In Colorado you can't collect rain water because California owns the water.


There was an exemption passed a few years ago that allowed for rain barrels.  It's mostly for personal use.
Wait... California owns the water that falls as rain in the state of Colorado? Can anyone from Colorado fill me in as to why, or how that's even legal? 
If you‚Äôd ever owned property you‚Äôd know that isn‚Äôt true. 
They paved paradise?
No not really. Most states require extensive environmental impacts for large projects, and in the case of a parking lot of that size they would certainly require holding ponds for runoff, to help capture any toxic particles before they enter the main water system.
What do you mean water no longer escapes into the environment?  That water gets pissed out at some point and enters the sewage system (or ecosystem if an outhouse is still your thing) and then gets treated and released back into the environment.  With your logic we should haven't have pipes delivering water to our house since its just sitting in the pipes until its used, water tanks shouldn't be a thing because that water is just sitting not being able to return immediately to the water cycle and so on.  

In all actuality, people get their panties into a bundle about the bottling companies because the stats used are "millions upon millions of gallons" without providing any context on whether that's a big number or not.  The biggest consumer of water in California is the cattle industry by several magnitude.  It takes 1800 gallons of water to make one pound of beef.  at 1,500-2,000 pounds each, that is 270,000 gallons of water per cow.  So Nestle using 8 million gallons of water equates to just under 30 cows worth of water (29.63 cows).  Statistics can be so misleading if you do not understand the context of which the numbers are being used.
Woah where do you live man, it sounds great
I'm not actively boycotting them and I also don't believe I've bought anything from Nestle in seven years. I'm sure I have, but most of their products are just things I"m not interested in anyway.

And after that previous paragraph and before submitting this post (a pre-emptive edit, if you will) I just searched their products I have bought Gerber baby food, ~~Purina dog food,~~ and on rare occasion Stouffer's meals.

I had no idea they had such a diverse range of products.

*EDIT:* After further review we actually get Iams dog food....not Purina. We buy it so seldom I always forget what brand we get until I get to the store and I recognize the bag!
All that squatting means reddit doesn't need to buy those workers desks to work at.
I thought it aswell I'd caulk it up to a dark humor
> Hasn‚Äôt it been proven that bottled water is the same if not worse than most major US city public water?

The problem with that statement is that it compares "bottled water" to "most major US city public water".

Let's say we ran with the public water supply in Flint, Michigan.  That would lead us to think that *all* bottled water is better.

Then there are the variances among bottled water - how does one compare distilled water (e.g. Aquafina) to spring water (e.g. Crystal Springs)?  They are barely the same product.  Aquafina would greatly outperform Crystal Springs in terms of *"which is better for your car's battery"*, but that's just about the only win I can think of.

Some cities have *awesome* water.

Here where I live (central FL), the city water comes out of the tap *green*.  Not ultra-algaeish-green, but green nonetheless.  You really see it when you fill up the bathtub.  There's some sort of oil in it as well.  We get *"boil-your-water"* notices several times a month because occasionally they lose pressure at a main and just assume that bad water got into the lines somewhere.  I didn't catch one of these warnings issued a week or two after Hurricane Irma this year and 5 of my chickens just up and died one morning about 4 hours after I refilled their water.  Turns out that the water main 30 miles south of me had indeed been contaminated, but I didn't get the memo.
The EPA generally has more stringent water purity requirements than the FDA. 
>because of what the incompetent government of Flint Michigan did recently

Just to be clear, Flint's government did not make the critical mistake here. The state-appointed Emergency Manager did. When the problems with the water were first detected the city council voted to switch to another source, but were vetoed by the Emergency Manager.

I see a lot of misinformation and lies about the Flint water crisis, and while the City Council is not entirely blameless, the major fault (and cover-up) falls on the Emergency Manager and Snyder Administration.

FWIW, Flint was on the Detroit system for years and was fine. It was only when Detroit became insolvent that they had to raise their water rates, which pushed other struggling adjacent cities (like Flint) onto other sources, that this became an issue.
Her family.
It is not lip service in the central valley, where land surface levels have dropped over 70 feet due to aquifer drawdown. Lawns and municipal use are nothing compared to the exorbitant water use of agriculture. The main "lip service" is on the part of big farms, who pepper the central valley highways with signs saying things like "food grows where water flows" or "is growing food a waste of water?". Yes...when 99.9% if what you're growing is subsidized and/or being shipped overseas because you decided to switch to a water intensive cash crop instead of growing actual local food, yes....it is a waste.

So the lip service thing applies to the conservation measures for you and me, but it is far from lip service at the state level. 

Sorry I know you were mostly referring to the personal use, but felt the need to rant about big ag considering I've been living in the central valley for a decade and see first hand the disparity between ag water allocations and prices and people's actual access to clean water.
They'll never go after the true abusers of water, which is agriculture with outdated practices. In times of extreme drought flood irrigation should be the first thing to get the axe, and maybe emphasize producing crops that are more drought tolerant. I mean lord forbid if you can't raise alfalfa in the desert, where else (it can grow in every state in the lower 48) will it be grown.
The first and second fine are in normal range, but *man* that third fine gets brutal. I'm in favor - This is a good idea. The fucking government wants to apply baseball's "Three strikes, you're out" to criminal behavior then let's apply it to criminal corporate behavior as well. 
interesting thought. never heard of them, thanks for explaining. i've only heard of the fines that are fined in percentages. i think finland is one of the countries where they use that. a poor guy driving too fast will only pay a few bucks. a rich guy driving too fast, may have to pay 30 000 dollars for his ticket.
is that not exponential?
Government worker here. Know what happens? They go over your head to your higher up. When that doesn't work, go over their head up through depts then to representatives, mayor sometimes up to Governor, Senator. You see all hard work you do go down drain and these Corps get away with it. SMH.
I'd call that a square deal
I came here to say exactly this. Things like this need to be investigated and the perpetrator caught.
This is the exact problem I have with corporate protection - the shielding of individuals from responsibility. I'm tired of hearing that "you can't put a corporation in jail." Well, you know what? A corporation didn't make those decisions, *people* did. And *people* should be held accountable.
if the fine hurts the share price, you can be sure that shareholders will fuck the company up.
So unionise. Get unions in place to actually fight for employee rights. 
These decisions are always distributed enough in blame that you can never nail one executive for it.

Companies are profit driven. If it were more expensive to do than to not do, they wouldn't do it. The courts just need financial experts that figure out the risk-adjusted profit of doing these things and fine them for that + punitive%

Companies might pass that down to employees, but then that changes the equation for employees who might then choose to work elsewhere. They might pass it on to consumers, but that changes the equation of how many consumers are willing to buy their product. Both of those hurt the company, which is the true driving force of these decisions.

 All the people who make decisions like these are beholden to their own forces. It's employees responding to managers responding to executives responding to shareholders responding to some automated investment algorithm trying to max out the yield on your retirement portfolio. There's a lot of blame to go around, but the system is driven by profitability, and if you want it to change you need to affect profitability.
So fine the fucking CEO
The sentiment is ridiculous. The administrative burden of figuring out who owns what shares and collecting the fine from them alone would be far more trouble than it's worth.

You as a shareholder are already paying those fines in the form of lost profits for the company whose stock you're holding, so increasing the fines to the point where it noticeablely affects the price would effectively do the same thing.
I also own stock in quite a few companies, and in fact live off those proceeds. I don't think we should directly have to pay fines, but I do think that companies that break the law should be hit hard enough that their stock price takes a substantial, long-term hit - if that's enormous penalties or jailing of executives - whatever. And yes, that will hurt me. But it's the only way for the law to have any teeth at all. As a shareholder, that's scary, but if I don't want to see criminals punished then I'm part of the problem.
if r/libertarian has taught me anything, capitalism is when the government doesn't do stuff and socialism is when they do
Practically every first world nation has a better welfare system than the US
So you're saying this law would create jobs?
That's hard jail time, better to work for a company that isn't shitty and semi evil in it's operations 
You know, that's a great business idea. Don't want to do your online driving school because you got caught speeding, pay me to do it for you. 

Convenience is a stronger drug than heroin, this will work.
Actually the early origins of civil forfeiture were exactly for this purpose, to prevent liability from behind offloaded to a subsidiary, while assets were transferred elsewhere. Doesn't matter greatly who "owns" the land or facilities used in the commission of the crime, they are up for seizing by the state because they were used in the commission of the crime. 
Corporations are Schroedinger's people. They're people when it's in their interests but they aren't when it's not in their interests. 
This is underrated. I wonder if citizen arrest laws apply to corporations too.
Can confirm -- my ex-girlfriend consumed more sugar than I'd seen in my entire life (she was Mexican, I'm American). She would eat *large* bags of candy every two days, soda all day, she'd make extremely fatty and greasy foods at home, lots of starch, fat and sugar. She was only 5'2", but she gained almost 40 lbs in the two years we were together.
it really is astonishing, I live in Mexico and most of my friends and relatives (both from Sonora, where in from, and from Mexico City, where my mother's family is) drink soda everyday, for breakfast, lunch and dinner

Water? Like from the toilets? 
Southern Californian here. We got a reverse osmosis purifier. Best $200 we ever spent. 
I see the /s, but I'll throw this out there anyway....


My household doesn't drink from the sink because the water supply requires a softener to not destroy the pipes and appliances in the house.  Softened water tastes like ass.



So we bought a few five gallon jugs from a local big box store at about $8 each and fill them up for $.25 a gallon from a source that doesn't taste like ass and have smaller reusable containers to take with us when we leave the house and want water to drink.


Even if it costs more than the utility charges for water, it's less than bottled water and a whole lot more friendly to the environment with a trivially small up front investment.  Oh, and we actually drink it, because ass doesn't taste good.
Well... A lot of major cities don't have good drinking water. Not Flint bad, but still bad.
while I have no problems with drinking water out of  the sink here in germany, I've seen quite some wierd shit like burning water in murica... Fracking and that shit makes me doubt the water quality over there...
Every large grocery store I've been to has a reverse osmosis filling station. People who can't drink their tap water should be buying refillable gallons and 2.5/5 gallon containers, not disposable 12 ounce bottles. I don't even mean that from an environmental standpoint. It's just cheaper.
There are also people that use untreated well water that just tastes off, even when run through a filter. I don‚Äôt blame them for going the bottled water route. 

Or if you‚Äôre on the go and didn‚Äôt bring/ran out of water and don‚Äôt know anything about the quality of the local tap water. 

There are plenty of legit reasons to drink bottled water. 
Like a corporation bottling water in a state with droughts? 

In any event, the law could have been written to prevent that specifically, since rainwater collection usually deals with water coming directly out of the sky and most people don't have neighbors that live directly over them in rural areas.
California didn't just take ownership of the Colorado River. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Compact

> The compact divides the river basin into two areas, the Upper Division (comprising Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) and the Lower Division (Nevada, Arizona and California). The compact requires the Upper Basin states not to deplete the flow of the river below 7,500,000 acre feet (9.3 km3) during any period of ten consecutive years. Based on rainfall patterns observed in the years before the treaty's signing in 1922, the amount specified in the compact was assumed to allow a roughly equal division of water between the two regions. The states within each basin were required to divide their 7,500,000-acre (30,000 km2) foot per year (289 m¬≥/s) share allotment among themselves. The compact enabled the widespread irrigation of the Southwest, as well as the subsequent development of state and federal water works projects under the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Such projects included the Hoover Dam and Lake Powell.  
  

Water is a first come first serve thing. California took ownership of the Colorado River. Almost all of Colorado's water goes there.
Can you cite your numbers? I think it's an interesting argument.  Not sure what the beef/cattle industry is like on the west coast, but up here in the Midwest, it's pretty big.  
Baltimore.  For as much bad press as the city gets, we're working to improve things.  It's difficult to overcome the stigma of *Bodymore Murderland*
I really liked Maybelline foundation, so as someone actively boycotting Nestle, it was super irritating to find out that was them too.
They act like cunts because they know they have penetrated deep and people will just buy their products without even thinking
The only thing I haven‚Äôt completely boycotted by them is a dog food they bought a few years ago (not Purina.) My dog doesn‚Äôt want to eat anything but it. We‚Äôre experimenting with different things with various levels of success, and I might just give him cooked chicken, rice, and sweet potatoes.

I know that‚Äôs contrary to what I just said, but I am actively and continually trying to get him off the food. I am not going to starve him for a few days until he eats anything, as that is cruel.
Purina is garbage anyway, you might as well switch to something better for a similar price and avoid supporting them.
It's lip service when you take his actual point, which was "watering their lawns or taking long showers...regulations about in-home water use and like low flow appliances".  The issue isn't those things, they are resource conservation theater.  The issue, a real one, is what you said, agriculture and actual planning.


I have an issue with Almonds because of this. Yes, they are delicious, nutritious, and are awesome in many facets...except for resource efficiency. They take way too much water to grow, and a state with water issues grows most of it.
but buying locally-sourced alfalfa will save the planet... somehow.
Seriously. A tiny increase in the price of agricultural water would have completely fixed the water shortage problem in socal. 
The problem with both the Democrats and the Republicans are each of their mottos': "If a corporation does it, it's not a crime."

I for one welcome the new company aaaaapple53, who is definitely not aaaaapple52 just restructured to avoid fines. 
"Corporations are people" -US Supreme Court
Forfeiture.

When the company refuses to comply with regulation and simply decides to pay the reasonable fines then take the property used in the illicit activity along with the profit.  Nestle loses not only its cash, but the property where it bottled water *and the brand name of the bottled water company*.

This is how scofflaw corporations should be treated.  It is exactly how drug dealers and even law-abiding citizens have been treated (you aren't being charged with a crime, your $50,000 in *cash* is being charged with a crime and found guilty without trial).  Why not extend that to corporations?
Yes, it's x^y, where x is a constant and y is the variable. 
exponential growth/decay is y = A\*B^(Cx) where A, B and C are constants (note that C is allowed to be negative, which is where exponential decay comes from). the formula he's describing is y = A(B)^n where n = number of times they've been fined before. so... sorta

a geometric series is when you multiply by the same constant over and over again. let's take a simple one, where A = 1 and B = 2

n = 0, y = 1\*2^0 = 1\*1 = 1

n = 1, y = 1\*2^1 = 1\*2 = 2

n = 2, y = 1\*2^2 = 1\*2\*2 = 4

n = 3, y = 1\*2^3 = 1\*2\*2\*2 = 8

etc.

edit: ~~the thing is that C is allowed to~~
The "perpetrator" is the entire board.

i mean fuck sake they literally own the president right now lol.
Corporations in America are so anti union, that they will close an entire store or warehouse if there is even a whiff of a suggestion to unionize.

Of course our spineless, corporately-owned government will do nothing to curtail this behaviour either.

So, while it's easy to say Unionize, it's not as easy to for people reliant on a paycheck to form one. 
>So fine *and jail* the fucking CEO


FTFY


Really, jail time needs to be commensurate with the crime. This is grand larceny on a massive scale. We jail kids for stealing statues in public parks. This is much bigger and should carry a similarly massive sentence.


There should also be a list preventing these bastards from working if they get out. Like a sex offender list for corporate criminals.
Exactly this. These companies should be punished and hit hard. Stocks should drop. Shareholders should feel the hurt. I don't however believe they should face direct fines on top of those unless they own at least like 5% stock
It would probably just end up being a lot of high school/college kids enjoying a tax free summer income along with some illegals at a local food bank near you!
You‚Äôre under arrest, Nestle! DROP THE WATER! I SAID DROP IT!

Perhaps you should look into getting an RO filter for the kitchen faucet.  It costs around $150-200 and gives you bottle-quality water right out of the tap.  It was the best home upgrade we've made yet.

>There are plenty of legit reasons to drink bottled water. 

To be fair theres legit reasons for plenty that reddit hates, twitter, paid DLC, Bottled water. It's never stopped the circle jerk before.
After it falls out of the sky, it doesn't disappear when it hits the ground.  It runs downhill, seeps into the ground, and into the water table.

On a small scale, no big deal.  If rainwater collection affects the flow of water into irrigation channels, big deal.

However, enforcement in particular was overly onerous to the small scale people.
It‚Äôs not necessarily over, that was a poor choice of words, but upstream.  

And no, it‚Äôs not any different than a corporation stealing the water.  It is exactly the same.  That‚Äôs why this is such an issue.
That's not true. The water is among 7 states per the Colorado River Compact. California didn't just take ownership of the river. 
Omar's coming yo! 
ugh is there anything they don‚Äôt own 
I was mistaken. We actually get [this bag IAMS](https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/PetSmart/PB1801_PROD_GROUP-IAMSProactiveHealth-20160818?$CL0404$). I mistook it for [this green bag of Purina](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61np-C0DjYL._SL1100_.jpg).

The two bags look similar enough that I can't remember which one we get until I look at the shape & size of the kibble.
And he acknowledged that.....
It is a large state, which means water is going to be more scarce in some areas than others, but it is certainly humorous that northern neighbor Oregon, despite having plenty more water, instead leads the country in *hazelnut* production, which is a highly efficient crop for water usage.

I've heard this enough times that I should probably just do it.  My issue is that I just haven't been able to make myself believe that RO can take my awful tasting water and actually remove the ass from it.  It seems like it's worth a shot, and then I can use the jugs as an emergency supply.
Unfortunately it takes age and experience to know that any time someone says "don't knock it 'till you try it" it's a trap.  If someone says that to you, sucker punch them in the taint and run as fast as you can.
Yeah. Lead, hexavalent chromium, and drugs like estrogen and other shit is all over the place. I used to do water sampling... It was eye opening.
My mom lives in a suburb where the ground water is contaminated with PFOA. It is considered safe ‚Äúbecause the part per million are pretty low and we haven‚Äôt studied the chemicals effect in humans so it‚Äôs deemed to be safe‚Äù.  
*180* of the 2000 water systems with high lead *break the law* by not reporting it. Only a few water taps are tested (5-10), and the tests are designed to check for leaching in existing lead pipes , often servicing houses built before 1930, but up to ~1980. There is no safe level of lead in drinking water.
Sounds to me like they should just trade crops...

Oh, I don't think Owen and Beru will have to worry about that.
Mr. Skeltal
Since a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
Just gonna throw my 2 cents in here.  I live in the midwest and my well water is horrible.  It will stain sink/tub with rust and stinks heavy of sulfur.  We run a high dollar water softener for utility and a RO for drinking.  It is well worth the money spent.  Have your water tested.  The softeners can be quite expensive for good ones, but my water is extremely bad out of tap and you would never know it.
I'm a commercial weed farmer. All of our water comes from RO. Typically, the tds, or total dissolved solids at 5 parts per million.  That really should get rid of it.  And if you don't like it, put it on Craigslist some weed grower will want it
You should.  The RO filtration process removes *everything* from the water, leaving only pure water.  If your water is really that bad it should make a huge difference.  It'll definitely get everything out, but if there's really lots of bad stuff in your water, then you might just go through filters more quickly than usual.
Reverse Osmosis makes the water safe for use in things as delicate as the salinity balancing of saltwater tanks for exotic fish. I'm 100% sure that it can remove the ass from your water.
>I just haven't been able to make myself believe that RO can take my awful tasting water and actually remove the ass from it.

Lmfao, oh man I'm dying here. 

But seriously, it's at least worth a try instead of refilling jugs constantly, no?
Personal anecdote, but it works for us. It‚Äôs a bit expensive to set up but tastes great imo. And our water is very metallic and leaves residue on glasses if it‚Äôs not filtered.
How much estrogen would be required to turn a frog gay? Hypothetically.

They are going to build the infrastructure to do that to Brazil.
Yup that one
Do you have a source for this? The only reason to import water into China instead of just pumping it there is if you're selling a luxury brand(shipping would cost way too much to sell it as run of the mill bottled water)

And to my knowledge the luxury water brands in China are overwhelmingly from Asian sources like the Changbai mountains and Tibet glaciers. Those that are imported are things like Fiji, Evian, and San Pellegrino.

What is this American sourced brand of water that Nestle is supposedly selling in China that you're talking about? Can you name it?
maybe the president, but I think Brazil as a whole is probably worth $10.
Your google broken??
If someone makes a claim they should be able to back it up. Just saying ‚Äúgoogle it‚Äù when they ask for your source is not really having any information.
Is yours? If you look you‚Äôll find no credible source supporting him. Nestle literally doesn‚Äôt have an American sourced water brand it sells in China. American bottling plants largely just serve America.

Sorry, this got a bit long.  Scroll to the bottom, formatting, editing, mobile, etc, etc and all that jazz.

I dont know if this will make an impact or not being that you are focused on Nestle.  As a former truck driver I can tell you that the Walmart brand bottled water is/was bottled at some of the same facilities as the Nestle brand.  Not all of these facilities are directly owned by Nestle but are contracted to bottle for them regionally.  I distinctly remember 2 in California and 1 in Texas as well as a few others but I can no longer be certain where I was.  

I found that this was the same case with one of the more notable mexican beers (Tecate, maybe?).  It was made and packaged out of the same plant as Coors in Golden, Co.

As is the case with much production, the cost to manufacture is the same regardless of the label that gets slaped on to the packaging.  

If you want to do the leg work, finding out and publishing where and whom is producing products for Nestle as well as other companies could have a larger impact on their bottom dollar.  For example, if water plant "A" in Name-a-town,Texas also bottles water for Generic Water Company(GWC), you could financially support GWC. If the demands to supply water for GWC rise at the same time as demand for Nestle Water drops the impact could have the effect that you are looking for.

Unfortunately this wouldn't have the total impact that you are looking for.  If the demand for Nestle Water were to completely evaporate Nestle could still switch over to packaging for the GWC that put their brand out of business.  

As I see it,  one way to keep up with this information would be to build a subreddit or a website where truckers and knowledgeable residents can update what products are coming from where.  The steps that would need to be taken to keep that information quiet could be too costly even for a major corporation like Nestle.  

For example:  Some companies will keep loaded trailers in a door so as to reduce the cost of having and maintaining a storage lot.  That meant that if I pulled the trailer from the door I saw everything, especially if I had to place load locks(those are the expandable bars that are held in place with pressure to keep your load from sliding around or toppling over).

The steps to seal a trailer and store it before a trucker picked it up could be as much as buying a yard truck, hiring 2 or more people to move the trailers around and shut and seal them and then requiring the receiver to handle things the same way in reverse.  In both cases the cost to have the land available would at the minimum be an additional cost in purchasing, maintenance and taxes.  In many cases the reciever might not be able to comply with such demands.  There are many companies out there that dont have the facilities to handle a trailer load of any one product so they will buy, as an example 6 pallets (skids) of one product, 2 of another, 9 of another etc, etc.  What this means is that Nestle could still try to keep a trailer sealed at their own facilities but a trailer could be opened and resealed multiple times before it is actually emptied. 

In short if you want to have the impact on a company that you are looking for it will take more than just avoiding their branding and their subsidiaries branding.  It would also require having positive and negative impacts on who their suppliers are in addition to whomever else their suppliers are supplying to as well as the recievers.

400 gallons a minute... In Michigan... What an absolute non issue. 
here we go again with the Pepsi - Aquafina and  Coca cola - Dasani P.W.S. (Public Water Source) scandals 
Michigan actually has too much groundwater. If the water table rises even a little bit more it will cause an ecological disaster. If we're really going down the "free" water rabbit hole I hope people are prepared to oppose beer, soda, jeans (1,800 gallons to grow the cotton for just one pair of Levi's!). Drinking water is *literally* a drop in the bucket compared to agricultural/industrial water use.

Nestle is a reason why I feel corporations should have expiration dates.  They should be required to be broken up at least every 50 years and not allowed to be reconsolidated or have parts bought by the same company/group/individual.

Nestle would rather slap you with an NDA then sue you for breaching it.

If water's like milk, there'll be a plant code.  I know who bottles store brand milk due to this publically available information.  A state could fight a gagging NDA by requiring plant codes "for health and safety".

I read that as you don't buy Nestle and you spread MSG (the flavoring) everywhere. I was very confused as to the relation of these things...
They're the largest food company in the world, and they own a lot of diverse companies. They likely aren't going anywhere. They've been growing revenue and market cap too. 
Thats basically impossible. They are the most diverse and widespread brand in the world.

Which is absolutely insane.  If you're going to pay the 1600% markup you want the company taking and further treating already purified water instead of *literally* stuff that comes from a hole in the ground.
But no one cares. They jump on the bandwagon about it being a bad thing. I'm becoming an environmental scientist in Michigan. I've researched a lot about this and I agree that while they should suppliment the water to Flint, the environmental implications of the aquifer not being drained is detrimental to that area of Michigan. 

I'll probably get hate for this tho, but it's the truth. Nestle still sucks for other things but this isn't the WORST thing they could be doing. 


So then you're claiming that Nestle is really the savior?  What is your evidence that Nestle pumping water out of the ground is preventing said ecological disaster?
The issue is that water for agriculture/industry stays where it is, bottled water gets shipped elsewhere.
Well, they do have a bit of a [history](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards) of being [evil](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nestle-ceo-water-not-human-right/) bastards. So I kind of get it.
My dad worked as a contractor for them, only company you'll ever hear him complain about, not paying their fair share is their business model.
Flint is without water because of the pipes. Michigan itself has a nearly endless supply of fresh water because of the Great Lakes. 
Please look at Michigan on a map. Note all of the blue stuff around Michigan. Its a lot of blue stuff.

Michigan has 21% of the entire planet's fresh water supply. 6 quadrillion gallons of fresh water. 6,000,000,000,000,000 gallons, give or take a few. Michigan is the one place in the planet that has effectively infinite fresh water, and it replenishes continually from rain and snow melts.

Niagara Falls is the overflow valve for all of this fresh water. There's so much fresh water that one of the largest, most impressive waterfalls on the planet is the excess that won't fit in the lakes. Some 640,000 gallons of excess fresh water falls over Niagara falls every single second of every day all year, every year. Ain't no way Nestle is ever gonna drink that dry.

People just don't comprehend the vastness of just how much water there is. Its so much water the human mind can't truly comprehend it.

The issue in Flint isn't a lack of water, the issue is bad plumbing.
You‚Äôre coming across as desperate and irrational here.

According to data compiled by Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), Michigan's nearly 40 bottled water companies account for less than .01% of water used in the state. Their water use in Michigan ranks them as  85 on the list of the state's top water users.
http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/Water_Use_Statistics_557539_7.pdf

The water use is naturally replenished through the water cycle. For example, the data shows that over the past 15 years, there has been an increase in precipitation leading to a corresponding increase in aquifer levels.

Nestle pays the rate set by the local and state authorities and do not receive a special rate for water use. They are not buying millions of gallons of water for $200. That $200 is an annual fee that goes to the state, similar to a car registration fee.
While Nestle is not a generally a "good" company, this pumping is really nothing.  150 gallons extra an hour in one well.  About the rate of flow of 6-8 garden hoses.  

And where they are specifically located (Evert Michigan - a several hours drive from Flint - not like you could just build a small pipe to get Evert water to Flint), there is no water shortage - in fact the amount is just a literal drop in the bucket and an excess of water.

And it seems that NESTLE DOES NOT ACTUALLY REALLY WANT EXTRA WATER ALL THAT MUCH- there is a secondary reason or the pumping:  

Basically, the local town had a history of setting off very large amounts of fireworks.  And then, other water users around the town started to use a bunch less water than they used to. Which helped caused the local water table to rise....and fireworks related chemicals to become a problem...

Which Nestle needed to find a remedy for ITSELF (and while they were at it, to also finance a clean-up of a problem so it did not spread to other wells Nestle was using re: the fireworks chemical problem).  

And partially as a side effect, and partially to keep ACTUAL locals on good terms with them, help the town with the fireworks related pollution issue.

>In the meantime, Evart has moved its fireworks display and is converting three existing Twin Creek supply wells to contamination purge wells that would pump perchlorate-polluted groundwater out of the well field, treat it, and then discharge the water into Twin Creek, which flows into the Muskegon River.

article says an increase from 250g/m to 400g/m.  Not sure if thats "as much as they please"

seems that no ones been able to conclusively show that this rate of water use is harmful to the ecosystem...  Which if true, makes me wonder why I should be upset... Its like complaining about solar or wind farms... bottom line is, there are water shortages in many parts of the US, and michigan is drowning in naturally abundant water.  Seems like a no brainer.  Whether or not nestle should pay something for this is another matter  that the local govt should address.

Im sure this does create more than a few jobs in the osceola township, so thats something they do get out of the deal.
There area they are in has no water scarcity

And it is not as much as they please or they would not had even needed approval to pump more 
[removed]
Yes. Because Michigan doesn't sell water. They simply require permits to collect it by the metric fuckton. No one is stopping the people of Flint from driving to the nearest lake or river and grabbing a bucket of water, just like what Nestle is doing. 
> 2 hours away Flint Michigan is still without water.
> 
> 

You're a liar.
I only real issue with the pumping is that we do not charge a volume rate, just the permit rate, which is something that should done so the people of Michigan benefit when a company takes water from our watershed. The lack of a volume rate would never happen for say oil, but it is fine for water because the law regarding it sucks.
No problem, they can just buy it from nestle. /s
Also the law in the state strictly outlines water as *not* a commodity to be bought or sold, so you can't legally charge money for someone (or an entity) to extract water from a source. 

People can pay for the utility to have their water treated and delivered to them, but you can't buy raw water. 

So the problem is not with Nestle as it is with the consequences of the law. And the agency that approved the permit therefore had no reason to deny them the permit, so they can't deny them the permit.
People always seem to miss that part. 
There‚Äôs also the fact that there is abundant water in Michigan and Nestle taking some is not hurting anything. 

Particularly, Nestle taking water has nothing to do with the water problems in Flint. Flint‚Äôs water is contaminated by the pipes it flows through, not at the source. Stopping Nestle taking water will do absolutely nothing to help Flint. 
This isnt in California
It has in great forom.  It's called the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.  I'd recommend a read.
What does California have to do with it?
[deleted]
Just cuz they employ people doesn't mean the ethical and good thing isnt to stop allowing companies like Nestle to sell water back to us. If people lose jobs oh well. It happens and in this case needs to happen. Or they could shuffle the jobs onto other products that dont do shady shit
Just like the Amazon had an infinite supply of trees?
Sounds like people should be drawing more attention to that rather than whining about water bottling.
>Nestle has been hit with a proposed class action lawsuit by a Massachusetts resident, claiming the company is engaging in deceptive marketing by hiding the fact that its chocolate supply chain involves child and slave labor.

Really? Is that your objective proof that Nestle uses slave labor?
Got any links?
 you don't really understand the permitting process did you.
DEQ determined that not draining the aquifers will be detrimental to the areas that are affected by it. I.e. sinking, flooding, etc. This was done by state environmental scientists/engineers. Look into it. 
Idk why you are being downvoted. I was talking about this with someone the other day and it‚Äôs impossible to determine where bottled water is sourced from (aside from spring water or purified/distilled water) and that is something the consumer should know.
Are you paying for the 300 thousand workers till they get a new job, if they get one?

None in my opinion, we're getting fucked and future generations are getting fucked. Once a water table is gone, its gone.  We've desertified lush landscapes many times and now we're doing it on a continental scale.

Edit: here's a short article on desertification and our involvement in it, http://scienceheathen.com/2015/01/05/desertification-effects-causes-examples-top-10-list/

Here's another link for a documentary called Blue Gold.  It deals with the privatization of water, its disastrous infrastructural, environmental and economic effects and the dry pit of doom we all seem so eager to jump into: https://youtu.be/pJD1TsiM6KY
How exactly are you planning to ‚Äúhelp the world‚Äù with that water?
If you wanted to put up a well there then you too can apply for a permit for the annual price of 200 dollars
Nestle pays exactly the same rate to draw water from their private well as any other business or citizen in the state.    

 Zero dollars.   

The state is not allowed to sell or charge money for water drawn from private wells. 
You could buy up a bunch of foreclosed houses and either demolish them or replace the pipes.
That‚Äôs just silly. 
That may be the dumbest thing I read on reddit today.

/s‚Äù

There I fixed it for you
Not to mention flint
Nestle has been absolute *scum* in the past, there is no reason why we should trust them now. There's no corporation running a hate campaign, it's just informed people who remember their past actions. 
It seems more like Nestle has hired a couple of shills to be naively positive about the whole thing. 
An NDA would only stick if Nestle had their own fleet of trucks, trailers and own drivers.  In which case they would have to go back the additional cost which would skyrocket way past the costs I pointed out earlier.

I drove OTR for 6 years.  In all that time I was only asked once for my ID for more than just my name.  The shipper wanted to make a photo copy.  I refused.  The shipper contacted my company, the carrier, and told them that if I didn't provide my ID the shipper wouldn't release the load.  My company, one of the largest transportation companies in the world, told them that they, my company, had a responsibility to protect my personal information and asking for anything more than me to show my ID was in breach of contract.  The shipper was told that if I was pressed further I would leave and that all the loads currently in transit would be recalled because that meant the others were pressured to hand over a copy of their ID's.  They also told them that any further contracted loads wouldn't be picked either and that all issues would be settled in court.  I love speaker phone.  There were more phone calls after that but in the end the load was released to me.  When I got back in my truck a company wide message had been sent out on our truck computers to never provide a copy of our ID's and to contact the company if we were pressured to do so.

We were coached to not talk about our our loads, what we were carrying, destination, origin, etc. but that was for our safety.  After that there was nothing that could stop a driver from talking about a shipper or receiver.
Hm, I'm actually pretty good on everything, but I didn't realize they owned part of L'Oreal. Dammit. Bye, favorite lipstick. 

Thanks for the link. 
I know ...and its no easy task. When in doubt I buy from other big compamys and I'm sure I made some mistakes ...but the intent counts !?
Any mexican consuming abuelita chocolate is supporting this bullshit. My advice (as a mexican) is to change brands, mayordomo is way better than abuelita, and it is a 100% mexican brand, plus... any local brand or any chocolate from your local market is way way better than abuelita, turn off the nostalgia goggles fuck that old lady and nestle.
I use an App to help me with that pesky problem: Buycott. Sadly that means not buying my favourite pizza as they're owned by nestle. but i do have my principles.
Just checked the list (again) and I should be good ... I try to stay away from finished products (pizza/cereal/etc.) that helps a lot üëçüèª
First, holy shit that list is long. 

Second, I do not buy any of that stuff (thankfully), but not because I am some good person on a mission, but mainly because I just buy produce and chicken.

The exception is recently I had purchased a DiGorno or whatever. Won‚Äôt be doing that again. 
I don't buy any of those. But mostly because I can't afford any of those brands, I suppose.
I don't buy anything from the brands listed. It's not that hard
Thank you for providing that link. I bookmarked it. Now when in doubt, I'll just check the list.
That‚Äôs incredible, I honestly had no idea how far reaching they truly are.   
Thanks for this list, the only things I buy regularly on there were a couple frozen pizza brands. Oh well, off brand is cheaper anyways. I grew up in Michigan, and don‚Äôt want to support them in draining the land and lakes.

Much harder to avoid is Loreal's cosmetic products actually that I've only just read about thanks to you, especially if that covers garnier and maybelline. As a student I don't really need to worry about avoiding lancome yet, but I'll have to watch out for the others.
People should memorize this list.  I do and avoid all Nestle products.  
at first I was like, wow I really don't buy any of their products.

Then I saw HagenDaz and screamed "Nooooooooo" in my head.
I do the same, it‚Äôs a struggle, but fortunately I mostly eat veggies and fish, not so much processed crap. And to my knowledge they don‚Äôt own Pelligrino. 
Don't buy Nestle's Haagen dasz ice cream; just buy the store brand, throw some MSG on it, and you're good to go!
Yep, they are partnered with Purina! Found out when I complained about a bag of Purina Cat chow made my cats vomit! The dang possum on the front porch wouldn‚Äôt eat that crap. Purina/Nestle did not want the lot # or a sample of the tainted food! They only care about themselves, not about your pets! 
make better content use your up and down votes and quit bitching
Down you go.
Nestle fucking kills people and animals. Their shitty Purina dog food nearly killed my dog due to melamine contamination. They‚Äôve had three class-action lawsuits against them over thousands of sick and dead pets who showed the same symptoms my dog did. What came of the lawsuits? Nothing. Nestle denies all responsibility.

I‚Äôm a Michigan resident and I want them staying the FUCK away from our water supply. This has nothing to do with environmental reasons and everything to do with their history of deceit, lies, and poisoning things. 
The overwhelming majority of water for agriculture evaporates once you bring it to the surface and spread it on the top layer.  Essentially, it also goes elsewhere.
Water tends to do that. Water also tends to return as rain and snow.

Where do you think all of the water flowing through Niagara Falls goes? Its fresh water that flows to the ocean. Water then evaporates off of the surface of the ocean, forms clouds, and those clouds drop water over land.

Water is not a consumable resource. It it not destroyed. It is infinitely, endlessly recycled. The water in your coffee this morning was inside a dinosaur at one point in time.
[deleted]
Yeah, people seem to forget this particularly evil part.  And Nestle is Swiss, which... its not like the entire country has shady practices.  None at all... 
Shhhh... No we don‚Äôt. Our water sucks. Look elsewhere for water if you value your health!
>Michigan itself has a nearly endless supply of fresh water because of the Great Lakes. 

They are not pumping the Great Lakes.
but but, Nestle has a permit to pump 400 gallons per minute. It'll only take them 15,000,000,000,000 minutes to use ALL the water. That's like next week or something.  /s
You're right, the $200 is an annual permit fee -- not a payment for water. Nestle draws water from nine wells in Michigan -- Nestle owns 7 and the city of Evart owns 2. Nestle pays $3.50 per 1000 gallons for the water they get from Evart. Nestle pays nothing (to the city, state, or anyone else) for the water drawn from their own wells. ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/business/nestle-michigan-water.html))
Yeah.. and what effect does it have in the long runs shipping it out? You're probably paid by nestle or a moron so fuck off.

It's an extra 150 gallons per *minute* so 9000 gallons an hour or 360-480 of your garden hoses. 
People miss the fact that bottled water moves location far from the bottling plant that uses an aquifer for the local area.  While miniscule on its own the water table can be affected and lowers enough that the nieghboring residents have to drill deeper.  Water acts slowly and more viscous in rock.  
Hey how much do you get paid by nestle? Where's water going and is it being replennished? What long term effects does it have?
You have to remember that only the main line is repaired. They also damaged the pipes into people's houses which have not been replaced yet.
[deleted]
> makes me wonder why I should be upset

You shouldn't be. Simple as that.
There's a small stream nearby. It was originally thought the stream was no part of the same aquifer that Nestle pumps. After pumping started the steam has measurably less flow.

It's possible that the steam really has nothing to do with aquifer Nestle is pumping. It's possible they're joined. We don't know. I for one support further scientific study into the matter, but until they have reasonably conclusive causation evidence I support taking no action.
Flint Michigan has been without water since April 2014. 

It‚Äôs the local and state government‚Äôs job to protect its citizenry and provide them with utilities and some essential services. 

Corporates and industrial permits are made to offset the costs associated with providing these essential utilities and services, and it maintain a regions bioavailability for generations to come.  

If the price nestle is being charged is insufficient to provide for the water infrastructure of the state, if clean usable water is being removed from the availability of dehydrated and lead poised children, if nestle lobbied the state to lower their fee by playing multiple states off each other, then there is a serious moral crises on both the Michigan government‚Äôs part and that of nestle. 
And those places can keep their hands off our water.

I realize that sounds abhorrently greedy. We‚Äôre fine with sharing but many of the areas with water shortages are areas that shouldn‚Äôt sustain such a high population (Phoenix, SoCal, etc). Michigan has a lot of problems and we‚Äôre at the very least fortunate to have the Great Lakes as well as hundreds of lakes and streams. Allowing a major corporation to pump our water opens the floodgates (no pun intended) for other corporations and states to drain us elsewhere. 
And it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs Nestle‚Äôs fault that the elected government of Flint decided to fuck with the water to save money and accidentally corroded their pipes.

I‚Äôm sure if anything Nestle stays far more on top of that than Flint ever did.
How about the fact that my state allowed Nestle to pump all the water they need, then sell at a HUGE profit, of which the State sees very little in return from. Our government is literally allowing such a trespass. How does this relate to Flint? Nestle wants to pump water, charge them a proper amount and allocate those funds to the repair of the municipal water supply, for the sake of the people who's water they are allowing this corp to take. It is not a hard thought to process.
They're doing it here in CA too.
Sorry typo. That's still hardly registers as a drop. To give context for how big 6 quadrillion is counting out loud from 1 to a million 13 days, a billion would take approximately 32yrs, a quadrillion has 6 more zeros than a billion and that's where I loose the math honestly. I didn't even actually graduate highschool shammed my way through 
So solar facilities need to go out of business too. They're selling that light back to us,. packaged so we can use it in our house.
You can dig your own well if you want. No one is stopping you.

Maintaining a well does suck. Depending on the condition of the ground you may have to change your filter almost weekly, but you can did a well if you want one. That water is then yours to take.
That is not at all the same. 


You didn't think this through did you? If managed properly, it does have infinite trees.
Nope, a bit more like using toothpicks is not causing deforestation.
No, that's not my objective proof, that's an article I linked in order to give anyone interested a starting point.

There are plenty of reports out there from the last couple decades, a ton of which were comissioned by Nestl√© themselves, that much better serve as objective proof.

Add to that eye witness accounts from towns that have been taken over and exploited since the 70's and I think there's enough general information out there to warrant my flippant condemnation.

You would have been more than welcome to ask me for more information on the subject, but you instead engaged in bad faith in the name of an inhumane and barbaric corporation that makes billions exploiting and stealing natural resources around the world.

So not only will I invite you to make a case *for* Nestl√© to prove they *don't* use child slaves, but I'll also ask you what sort of agenda has found you here defending Nestl√© of all things.

Edit: linked you some objective proof on my original comment.
Idk either you would think people would want to know this stuff.  I mean the fact it's it's  possible to tell that about 90% of all the cereal brand's  are owned by like 4 or 5 companies and there are only about 3 actual manufacturers.  It shouldn't be so hard for a consumer to track where their stuff comes from
The Jawas will put them on their payroll.
Creating jobs and paying taxes is what companies do. It's not like they're giving money to employees for nothing in return.  If Nestle needs our water shouldn't they pay a fair price for it?
>Once a water table is gone, it‚Äôs gone.


While that might be true in sunny California, in the state of Michigan water is quite literally limitless. The 50,000 or so gallons Nestle pumps out in a day will be refilled by the literally quadrillion‚Äôs of gallons of water contained within the Great Lakes.

Michigan doesn‚Äôt have to be quite as strict with water conservation as the American Southwest should be.
That's not even a joke, it's a real thing that real people do to avoid getting scalped by their local water mafia.  Some of my neighbors got one last year.
Why?  That's how it was until a hundred or so years ago.
Why because I don't like the idea or an immortal entity with the power that modern day corporations currently have?
No. It's more along the line of Trump's supports. A curious group of drunks.
In the parent comment‚Äôs link, it says that no state in the Great Lakes area considers water to be a commodity, but rather a resource. This means water is not bought or sold. Therefore, according to the law of Michigan, the fair compensation due by Nestle in this instance is $0. I agree with the parent commenter on this one, that link is fascinating.
Another Michigander, and I am also stunned by the above comment,

The belief ‚Äúlook at all the lakes, they have plenty of water‚Äù is overly simplistic.  I have watched the shore of Lake Michigan over the past decade recede away as the levels of the Lake have continued dropping.  

Removing water from the planet‚Äôs ‚ÄúWater Cycle‚Äù and storing it in.plastic containers is a bad call, regardless of the corporation doing the bottling.
[deleted]
I mean, Michigan is kind of famous for being surrounded by water. The great lakes account for 21% of the world's freash water by area, and Michigan has the second most lakes of any us state.

>... a corporation profiting off our state's resources.

There are a lot of corporations who use water, and none of them pay for it. What makes Nestle different? Should Faygo get free water because they put corn syrup in it before they sell?
[deleted]
Also a Michigander. Nestle is exploiting a loophole in the Great Lakes Compact, an international treaty between all the Great Lakes states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York) and Ontario and Quebec. The Compact specifically states that the diversion and distribution of the Great Lakes, the Great Lakes Basin, and groundwater, for commercial purposes, outside the borders of the Basin. As was mentioned in another comment Snyder has links to Nestle so of course they got a great deal on raping our most precious resource.

A single Olympic sized swimming pool is 660,000 gallons. Thats not even enough water to fill one pool. Water comes in such vast quantities measuring it by the gallon only makes sense if we're talking for individual human consumption.

For industrial or agricultural purposes you measure it by the acre-foot, or other similarly huge units. A gallon isn't a lot of water. A hundred thousand gallons of water is still not very much, especially not compared to the overflow valve called Niagara Falls. All of the fresh water that doesn't fit in the Great Lakes flows out there. Its a lot of water.
What‚Äôs your response to the claims of perchlorate leaching and the need to lower aquifer levels to prevent it? 
That‚Äôs interesting. Two of my previous companies required ID from every driver pickup that was food related. FDA food defense rules along with anti terrorism countermeasures dictated we make a copy of the drivers license 
Look into getting the Buycott app. You can select something you want to boycott and scan the product you‚Äôre potentially buying and will tell you if it‚Äôs conflicting with your agenda 
There's an app called buycott that'll help you avoid brands like nestle.
L'Oreal also has a history of testing on animals so they just suck in general

if you wanna be sure, just use the Buycott app, you can scan products to check for their parent company
There's enough people doing that to effect their sales. Probably only like 5%... But the more business they lose, the better. 
Your favorite pizza comes from the supermarket?
Find out if there is a dairy that hosts a dairy bar in your region. In Niagara-on-the-Lake there is Avondale Dairy, with an amazing dairy bar with a load of fantastic flavours, open from late- March to late October every year. The cows that provide the dairy are in the barns out back. The product is fresh and amazing. The fruit (if you chose, say, peach or strawberry sundae) is cut right before your eyes - not syrup from a bottle. Much better than crap from a grocery store container. See what you can find..
Once you have Hagen-Dasz it kinda ruins all other ice creams. I loved Ben and Jerry‚Äôs until I had Hagen-Dasz. 
You ever tried making your own? or getting it from shops? My favorite ice cream shop is a little one in Amsterdam that makes the ice cream fresh all day so when you go in there chances are you're getting ice cream that was made 10-15 min. prior. There is a nice dairy farm not too far from where I live now that makes their own ice cream and also sells pretty great non-homoginized cream line milk that can be used for making your own or making yogurt and cheese.

Funny, I still said Nestle sucks but I also have the cognitive ability to realize that even if a company is ass, they can still have an positive effect on the environment 
I am a Michigan resident and I have no problem with them having pumping operations here. I do think we need to amend the law so they have to pay a volume rate though, just like they do to the city of Everett.
Yes. Which is *exactly* what the article I posted said. Instead he said it was an "extreme position". Why exactly did you respond to me?

Where do you think Michigan's ground water replenishes from? Might it be from all of those lakes in and around Michigan?
I'm on Grand Rapids water system, along with most of the metro GR area. Their pipe come from Lake Michigan. Detroit's water comes from Huron (including the water going to Flint).
You forgot to add in the rate at which the atmosphere will replenish the water. I‚Äôd hazard a guess at fucking never.
Still a relative drop in the bucket.
; )     ---  how many gallons do your hoses output in a minute?  Mine can fill a 5 gallon bucket in a bunch less than a minute.

However, I might have been a hose or so short.

https://www.hunker.com/12474071/how-much-water-goes-through-a-garden-hose-per-minute


What long term effects? Water isn't being destroyed. People pee out the water within hours. The water eventually flows to the ocean, evaporates into clouds, and the clouds drop rain and snow which then accumulates into lakes.
1.  A large amount of pipes have been replaced.
2.  You clearly have no fucking clue how they test for lead.   The lead test takes place at customers taps.
Why should we remember this when it still has nothing to do with the Nestle permit?
The purveyor can replace lead service lines but past the property line it's up to the homeowner to replace pipes in their homes. The purveyor's responsibility is maintaining water quality to prevent corrosion of lead and copper pipes. 
The problem in Flint has nothing to do with clean water sources, it has to do with lead in the pipes. Two different issues. Flint doesn‚Äôt need more water, it needs new pipes.
Michigan has access to more fresh water than they could ever hope to use (Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie)

Nestle (or any other company) could pump out 100x more water and it wouldn't affect Flint at all. The problem with Flint is their pipes, not that there's a water shortage. 
[removed]
It isn't available to those people, though. So even if the governments of the two townships want to work together to extract, treat, and ship/pipe it to Flint, it has nothing to do with Nestle. Fuck nestle for their global exploitation, but this scenario is not that.
Not sure why all the downvotes. Why doesn't Nestle go catch all that excess fresh water that won't fit in the Great Lakes right at the falls then? I mean, its just getting wasted running into the ocean right now. Lol.
So is it? Did they?
Hope you don't have any agriculture, businesses (like car manufacturers), or residential homes in Michigan as they use billions and billions more water than what is taken from the water table by the Nestl√© plant. 
Then here's a revolutionary idea!  *Sell* it!

Oh, you are!
good thing the rest of the country didnt feel the same way about bailing out the automakers that sustain michigan...  Guess if they had, Michigan would be a wasteland and no one would be around to notice nestle pumping some water.
There's more to it than that.  The city of Flint was too broke to be able to afford it's former water source.
> And it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs Nestle‚Äôs fault that the elected government of Flint decided to fuck with the water to save money and accidentally corroded their pipes.

Unelected*

But yes, you're correct. 
The government doesn't charge any body for water, not should they.
Michigan has an effectively infinite supply of fresh water. 21% of all fresh water on the planet. Niagara Falls is the overflow. They have that much fresh water.

Of course its sold for a huge profit. Water in Michigan is so cheap as to be pretty much free. Its not a valuable commodity in Michigan because it is so plentiful.
First of all, the state allows *anyone* to pump pretty much all the water they could need. Every single person in Flint has just as much right to extract free water as Nestle does, though the water exactly under their house may be less than ideal for extraction and use somehow, or their well-digging abilities might be restricted by the city. If you wanted to pump and treat all the water, you could go start your own extraction operation, though if it's big enough you might have to pay a similar small fee to offset the state's small licensing/monitoring/etc. costs.

Second of all, what basis do they have to charge exorbitant prices for an essentially infinite resource that costs little to nothing to maintain? Just because they can? 
That's not at all what is happening.
It is how we get our water, lots of iron in it around here, but with facet filters it tastes fine.
Yet, It's shrinking. So what does that mean?
What is a fair price for something so abundant?
Even still, nearly all of the water consumption in California isn't for human consumption. Its for industrial or agricultural purposes. Its for watering lawns. The amount of water a person actually drinks is tiny. Very nearly 100% of California's water use is not used for human consumption. Only the tiniest remainder of that pie graph, so tiny it can't be seen, so tiny its not even a pixel, is used for human consumption.

California has amazing soil and a fantastic climate for farming. The problem is that the natural environment is savanna. Two out of three ain't bad. At not point will California ever run out of drinking water. Farms and industry may suffer, but there will always be enough to drink. A small residential lawn may use 100 gallons a day. Even the most extremely well hydrated person in the world is only going to drink a gallon of water a day, tops. That same amount of water for lawn care is enough for 100 very well hydrated people.

With Michigan these concerns are a joke. Michigan has access to 21% of the entire planet's fresh water supply. Michigan has the most fresh water of any place on the planet. There is literally no other place on Earth with more fresh water than Michigan. I do wish all of these Nestle haters would understand what it is they're actually protesting. Protesting against Nestle, claiming it will use up all of the water in Michigan, is like someone protesting that you should stop breathing because you'll use up all of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Its utter nonsense.
I'd much rather have municipal control over any effort to privatize such a necessary natural resource.  Better oversight, no price gouging, better water quality and we have the security of knowing that it's ours.  

Companies like Nestle, Veolia and other private entities will almost always fire experienced and well trained workers for scabs which will result in a lack of experience and damage to the infrastructure that tax payers will turn around and have to pay for.  Think of PG&E and San Bruno, PG&E fired all the workers that knew where when and what needed to be fixed, their bottom line attitude caused a whole city block to explode when a transmission line ignited. They always go for the bottom line and they don't give a fuck about regulations, they don't give a fuck about their workers and they certainly don't give a fuck about us.  The more we let our resources into the hands of a greedy few the more we all suffer.  

This is all on top of the environmental impact I pointed out above.  So they may not drain Lake Michigan in our lifetime, and we regulate it, but dont think for a second that if we didn't regulate it those Nestle fucks wouldn't drain the lake and smile doing it. Quadrillion gallons are quite a lot, you're right, the numbers are on your side.  But morality and common sense are on mine and I believe that.
Oh yeah, I‚Äôve got one over at the family farm. The water tastes delicious as hell and the only cost is electricity for the pump. I was just being an ass because the problem with Flint was not that they didn‚Äôt have water, it‚Äôs that the city cocked it up and made it too acidic for the pipes.
Gonna need a citation for that, because there are many very old companies. This means that on the face of it your claim is quite simply false.

The Hudson's Bay Company, a company once so powerful it had its own military that rivaled that of most world powers, still exists. Now this company owns a line of retail stores mostly in Canada, but its still the same company. It was founded in 1670.

Lloyd's of London has been providing insurance since 1686.

Heinz has been making sauces, including ketchup, since 1869.

Pabst Brewing Company has been making beer since 1844, and this is one of the younger major brewing companies. There are European beer and wine companies that have been in continuous operation for nearly a thousand years now.

Colgate has made a variety of consumer products, including toothpaste, since 1806.

Nestle itself is a Swiss company founded in 1866.
Especially since we already know they'll try to abuse the permits just like they did in california
>I have watched the shore of Lake Michigan over the past decade recede away as the levels of the Lake have continued dropping.

You must have stopped watching recently. Lake Michigan levels are at an 18 year high 

https://www.weather.gov/mkx/highlakemichiganwaterlevel

You‚Äôre just ignorant. There‚Äôs no shortage of water whatsoever.
Lol,  watched it recede?  Lol... dude the water level has always fluctuated and is currently higher than average...lol.  maybe try looking at the actual data..

Love the down votes for looking at actual historical data.   You stay classy reddit.
You understand that people drink the water right?  It's not being removed from the water cycle anymore than your tap water is.
You can't take water out of the water cycle in any meaningful way. People drink the water from inside those plastic bottles and then piss it out. That piss then goes into the ocean, then evaporates, and then falls on your head!
Lake levels are higher than they've been in decades though? [Historic Increase](http://www.woodtv.com/news/michigan/historic-increase-in-great-lakes-water-levels/1035906006)
The link details how the state judges usage and applies fees but does nothing to justify the pittance of a fee. 

When I say due compensation for a corporation profiting off our state's resources I mean just that. I consume water but don't profit off it directly, they do. Its a global commodity to them, one that brings global shareholder value to the corporation, and should be taxed as such. The current regulatory regime is a joke.
> I mean, Michigan is kind of famous for being surrounded by water. 

Which are not the aquifers the corporations pump. 

>none of them pay for it

substantiateyourclaims.jpg

>Should Faygo get free water because they put corn syrup in it before they sell

People are demanding Nestle pay more than pittance for what they sell as a high profit item. Not pay less.
You tell me.
Gonna be honest, I don't know enough about that stuff to determine if it's bullshit or not. If those claims are coming solely from Nestle themselves or scientists funded by Nestle, it's most probably exaggerated. If I hear it from independent geologists I'd probably believe it. But to me it doesn't really make sense that the water table would suddenly need to be systematically lowered by humans (if that's what they're saying?). 
Would this have been in the last 5 years?  Also, was this for shipments coming into or out of ports?  I never picked up my TWIC Card since most of our port frieght came out of Longbeach, Ca.  California sent me a nice letter in 2010 stating that if I wasn't compliant with the new laws going into effect in 2011 that required DEF on all rigs regardless of year of manufacturer that I wouldn't be legally allowed into the state.  Dang it! I cant seem to find the 11k to have that installed! Shoot!

Anyways, I sold my rig and quit the road life a few short months after quite a few laws changed in 2013.  The 8 hour rule and the funny rule regarding the 34 reset starting or ending(I forget which) between 1am-5am, also JIT freight was dropping off in favor of cheaper rail frieght.  Even though my truck was paid off I still needed ~1800 miles a week before I turned a profit which wasn't too hard when I had a student with me but after 5 years of almost constant training I was burnt out and was looking for some alone time just when things started changing.  Also, I officially went Pro that year as with so many truckers, my wife and I were heading towards our eventual divorce.  I looked around and asked myself why am I still doing this and sold my rig for a loss a couple weeks later and restarted life.   I still hold my CDL and my endorsements just incase. It really is a small price to pay every year to know I have a back up to my current career which still allows me to drive, which I love to do, but at the end of the day I watch what I want to watch instead of constantly watching NCIS at Flying J, I shit in my own toilet,  sleep in a bed without listening to the truck next to me idling or the regen cycling through a burn and my dinner isnt behind a glass case or the coleman cooler sitting between my seats.

True Neutral? 
Aquifers get pumped faster than they can naturally replenish. This is how Nestle ended up in Michigan to begin with, they chase cheap water. 

"Nearly endless" implies a lot while barely acknowledging the truth of the matter. If you don't know much about the economics behind harvesting a state's resources you probably shouldn't comment.
Yeah, I guess nobody understands humor.
Yeah, but my hose fucking evaporates in "My" backyard. So fuck off nestle 

Any company removing water from Michigan should be paying industrial and corporate fees that support sustained access to water for all Michigan residents. 

This is a failure of the Michigan government, ballasted by the lobbying efforts of Nestle
The problem with Flint is America.
Fun fact. We're actually made of two peninsulas. 
[removed]
Coming in pretty hot there, angry man
Yeah but agriculture actually produces something with that water, Nestle is just bottling it up and selling it for $2 a bottle.
Your point? I think most people know that this water deal alone won‚Äôt make much of an immediate impact. Rather, concerns are centered on the principle of taking our state‚Äôs greatest resource and shipping it elsewhere. And that starts with this water deal.

They should charge a business for the use of it for gains and profits. The fuck. That is pretty much Governments job.
Water is always a valuable commodity. Always.


The same basis that it is a large corporation not bottling it for personal use, but to make money. The same basis that says if you do nto pay your property tax, you lose your house. The same basis that we are still suckered and forced to pay one third of our wages each week. Fuck man, you even have a concept of how fucked this is?
As I recently looked at it, if Nestle bottled a liter of water for everyone on earth every day using Michigan water it might reduce the level of one of the great lakes something close to a single wavelength of blue light, so no\-\- its kinda similar to using solar power, there's not an infinite supply but we're not running out of spots that aren't covered with panels.
I sometimes wonder if we should have dug an iron mine instead of a well. The amount of iron that thing picks up is absurd. It kills filters in less than a week.
Illegal Brazilian loggers and cattle?
Nestle is making a profit off of a shared natural resource, so they should pay the state of Michigan some small percentage of the profits they make selling Michigan water.  

According to [this article], in one year Nestle sold $343 million worth of bottled water sourced from Michigan.  Even just one percent of that would be over $3,000,000 for the state.  That amount can make a huge impact.
There are a lot of people who seem to think that everywhere else in the US has the same problems as the coastal regions.  Whether it's the lack of rain or high real estate costs or taxes.  They're problems must be affecting everyone else too.
Once California starts hurting much worse than it already is, and states like Nevada cut off Cali‚Äôs access to their water then we will start seeing meaningful solutions to the problems California faces. 

Eventually they‚Äôll be forced to either pray for rain to refill the aquifers that they‚Äôve drained, pass regulations on agriculture to limit the amount of water they can use, or pay the expensive price of desalination.

It‚Äôs a problem entirely of their own making, maybe once the populace can‚Äôt afford to stay hydrated they‚Äôll tell the almond and grape industries to either cut back or take a hike. But then they‚Äôll be absolutely boned financially. 

Anyways, as far as Nestle goes I really don‚Äôt see the problem, they follow the same regulations as everyone else and the state is the one who decides how much each permit holder is allowed to pump. If the residents have a problem with that they can vote to change it. 

My sneaking suspicion is that Michigan residents will prefer the jobs Nestle provides over the losing the .000001% (if that) of water in the Lakes that has seen water levels rise in the 20 years.
US based corporations not foreign ones
Sometimes it goes away and then I see it come back later. Magic. 
My company uses approximately 10k gpm between a local river and aquifer and we don‚Äôt pay for it. In fact, all of the other refineries around where I live don‚Äôt either.
You need some basic science refreshers. The water in the aquifers comes from the lakes.
No ports all manufacturers or 3PL sites in the Midwest. I can‚Äôt say I blame you for selling the rig, I don‚Äôt drive but I know I couldn‚Äôt handle OTR trucking. I could maybe do high mile local routes but I hate big cities in my car let alone a 53‚Äô or even a damn 28‚Äô straight truck. The driver shortage is getting insane right now honestly, big good companies offering 15k starting bonuses for local routes and can‚Äôt find people to fill the seats. Good luck in your new spot, I am sure your back is already thanking you for it!
Oh I forgot to add, we mostly pulled dry van unless we were Walmart or Target dedicated or we helped out with overflow.  I might drop off a dry van, pick up a refer, run a route 1 or 2 nights, return the refer and grab an mty dry van.  Most food stuffs I picked up had long shelf lifes with no refrigeration required.  Soda, water, canned goods, alcohol.  That sort of thing.  If the seals broke no one was going to put it on their shelves anyways so I don't think what I was moving would have fell under those particular FDA guidelines.  Also the one example I had where they asked for my ID to make a copy I think I was picking up car parts or computer parts.  I can't remember.  My alternator kicked the bucket about half a mile from their gate and another driver had to recover the load from me so I dont remember where it went.
The fact that an app like that exists suggests the opposite
More like let's keep hundreds of rabbits, mice and guinea pigs confined in cages and test our chemicals in their eyes and ears and make them swallow our products for weeks at a time to test for side effects, then euthanize them all when we're finished. 
Do you want to know more?
Good for you!
Now they just need to do the parts of 19 others and then we'll really hit them where it hurts.
I hate them too and make a conscious effort to not buy their products but I don‚Äôt heavily scrutinize every product so I‚Äôm sure I still buy their stuff from time to time. Up until about 15 minutes ago I didn‚Äôt know they owned Haagen Dazs so that‚Äôs a bummer for me as well.

You seem to be under the impression that I think he *did* say that water is not a human right. I did not say nor imply that. I posted the snopes source exactly for that reason. Personally, I felt that his position was stupid enough to use as an example why he is an idiot.
Neutral Evil for sure.  
And if there was any evidence that they were pumping enough water to affect the environment and the aquifer's replenishment rate, then that fact could have come up as a reason not to grant the permit. Unfortunately for those in the ANECC (Anti-Nestle-Everything Circlejerk Coalition) railing against Nestle for various moral or pseudo-environmental reasons, there has been no such issue worth restricting pumping rights; otherwise it would be brought up every time someone is in opposition. 

> If you don't know much about the economics behind harvesting a state's resources you probably shouldn't comment.

Funny, I would apply that logic to this situation and the 98% of Redditors talking about it.
OK then those companies will just move elsewhere and you won't have 

1. Those jobs 2. locally bottled water .

I'm sure getting rid of both of those will certainly help flint.Not like they need bottled water ! 
I honestly doubt it has much to do with lobbying efforts. Michigan simply has access to the largest source of fresh water on the planet. Even if they *did* charge for it, the supply so mindbogglingly outpaces demand that the price would essentially be zero.

~~Also Flint is ~600 miles away from the pump Nestle is using.~~ Flint's issue has absolutely nothing to do with a lack of fresh water in the area, it's the municipal pipes.
The problem with Flint is poor city governance. 
No, it's not a fun fact. You jerks got the UP and all us Ohioans got in return was Toledo. Fucking Toledo 

Like the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals. 
Yeah, laypeople tend to mentally treat water like petroleum, as in once it's used, it's gone. 

Everyone seems to forget elementary school when we learn about the water cycle, and how it's not really destroyed. We're literally drinking largely the same water dinosaurs were pissing out 80 million years ago
Coming in pretty ignorant there, kiddo.
[removed]
You‚Äôre coming across as desperate and irrational here.

According to data compiled by Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), Michigan's nearly 40 bottled water companies account for less than .01% of water used in the state. Their water use in Michigan ranks them as  85 on the list of the state's top water users.
http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/Water_Use_Statistics_557539_7.pdf

The water use is naturally replenished through the water cycle. For example, the data shows that over the past 15 years, there has been an increase in precipitation leading to a corresponding increase in aquifer levels.

Nestle pays the rate set by the local and state authorities and do not receive a special rate for water use. They are not buying millions of gallons of water for $200. That $200 is an annual fee that goes to the state, similar to a car registration fee.
No it wasn't. The city had been under emergency management for nearly a year and a half before the switch to the river. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis#Pre-switch
No, it isn't the governments job to discourage the use of water in places with more of it than they could ever possibly use. If the people of the Great Lakes River basin area that that bottling facility serves didn't value the service Nestle provides they simply wouldn't be buying it.
Pumped and treated water can be valuable. Untreated groundwater in places like the Midwest however is not valuable. 
I know the feeling.
So it's not being managed properly then? Corruption and immorality are the same whether legal or not. 
Plenty of companies make a profit from a shared natural resource without paying anything. 

Are you proposing to charge Uber a fee to use oxygen from the air in internal combustion engines? That oxygen is very important for humans to breath. 
Henry J. Heinz was an American. He founded his company in Pittsburgh.

Colgate was founded in New York City by a British immigrant.

Then the need for it suggests the opposite.
You're being illogical here. How else will I know whether I can put lipstick in my eyes or not?

omg this is just like facebook *cries*
In my experience, the only ones restricted by aquifer replenishment are homeowners. Golf courses are mysteriously unaffected. 

Looking at you San Jacinto River Authority.
Flint residents are no longer receiving rations of bottled water
Good. No one wants another huge corporation gobbling up productivity, while barley compensating workers  and squirreling the profits in an offshore account safe from the IRS. 
Flint is about 100 miles from Evart, MI, the city nearest to Nestle's wells. ([source](http://tjpeiffer.com/crowflies.html) - need to plug-in city names)    

Not saying this makes a difference, just correcting the misinformation.
I dunno. Alaska ranks pretty highly up there as one of the best and/or worst trade deals in history depending on which side of the deal you were on.

The US took Russia to the cleaners on that deal.
Just think how Toledo feels about the deal.  Haha
Hm. Noted.

I'm sure your opinion of one thread on reddit will resonate through the ages
Its just bad visuals. You have a town 2 hours away that hasn't had clean water in years while an international conglomerate with other shady business practices pumps water out. You're right, in the grand scheme of things its not a debilitating amount of water being pumped out. This just feels like it goes along with the general feeling more and more people are having that their government cares more about big business than its citizens
You are terribly daft.
Which has nothing to do with the original point that trees are infinite. They just keep replacing themselves. Water in Michigan especially at 400 gallons a minute is infinite. You're not going to drain the aquifer ever at that rate. Aquifers are being constantly replenished. The only time there is an issue is when you take more out than is being naturally replaced.
There is a middle ground between dystopia and utopia. I‚Äôm 90% sure that‚Äôs where we are right now.
I'm sure L'Oreal would pay you to be their new guinea pig
Things are different in the Great Lake state than Texas.
They get paid in barley, instead of money?
It is okay to be ignorant, but you might want to correct that ignorance before opening your mouth.
Lol at the down votes. I guess maybe you do want that but god knows why
It doesn't matter. Flint's problem is corroded pipes. It doesn't matter if the water has to travel 500 miles or 500 feet. As long as the pipes are corroded and full of lead the water will still be contaminated.
I don't believe that's the pump in question though. The article says the one they're increasing is in Osceola Township, which is ~600 miles from Flint.
Louisiana Purchase is another one to add to the front page of that book....

Goddamn the US has scammed a lot of countries out of a lot of extremely valuable territory.
Do you enjoy being willfully ignorant? Your "zero critical thought" mentality is why we get shit like Trump. You're just the same thing on the other side of the coin. 
The more you look into it, the more normal and not evil it becomes.

The ‚Äòbad visuals‚Äô are entirely the fault of the people promoting half-truths with no appropriate context.

Which yes, fuels the hatred of ‚Äòbig business and government being evil together‚Äô; and here is the thing, Nestle are doing shady stuff in some places, like California, but here it looks pretty clear that they really just aren‚Äôt. 
Says the moron who apparently didn't make it through elementary school and is unaware how the water cycle for places like the Midwest make untreated groundwater a valueless resource because of its insane supply.

"Let's not let our local economy benefit from our resources, I'm a genius!"

Say "Yah" to da yoo-pee, buckaroo.
Wheat and Barley prices are shite right now. If we‚Äôre getting paid in commodities I want to get paid in Pork Bellies.
Yes, however maize can be easily substituted. 
No it‚Äôs not. The lower peninsula is only 277 miles long at it‚Äôs longest point. I‚Äôm more inclined to believe Flint is 60 miles away from Osceola Twp (even though it‚Äôs longer than that).
Well I suppose about some things I do

I operate everyday willfully ignorant of quantum mechanics and how to bake pies, among a great many other things not within my areas of expertise.

I imagine you are willfully ignorant as well on certain topics.

Do you enjoy expressing some sort of latent macho energy through aggressive comments on the internet that neither win you nor lose you anything (except of course time and the emotional energy necessary to get mildly salty)?
So as long as it doesn't look like it here, it doesn't make a difference? Same company, just in a place that has more sustainable amount of water. Still the same greedy executives that drained certain places dry off water when it could have been avoided with some study and paying attention to the water levels in said places.

To me a company not willing to do the right things the first time round won't do it the second. I am not commenting though on whether the argument to not allow Nestle more or less water in this instance though. 

However my opinion is that bottling water should stop. It is not a commodity to be traded and sold. It is something that everyone should have a right to (safe drinking water) as it is a necessity to live. And states do that by not allowing people to pay to get it but as utilities. But I don't get why we're dumb enough to pay for it when you get it out of the tap for free, unless you're places that have been drained of said water. People are too busy with visuals of looking rich or being rich so they clamour for random consumer goods to say that. 
I understand exactly how it works. I also understand how the State and Federal government rapes the people of their hard earned money while letting a corp like Nestle make money for almost free. I know a gentleman in Northern Wisconsin who has to pay much more to the state to pump and bottle the water in his land, from the Lake Superior ground water. What I am saying is the meager price they paid for access to the peoples water supply is ludicrous when you consider all the other ways they take money from the people.  
Why would you ever not want to be paid in pork? Delicious
You're right. Apparently there are *two* Osceola Townships in Michigan, one on the northern Peninsula (Dollar Bay) which is ~360 miles from flint straight, or ~500 by road. The other is pretty much right next to Flint. I am now entirely uncertain which one it is.

>I operate everyday willfully ignorant of quantum mechanics and how to bake pies, among a great many other things not within my areas of expertise.


And I bet you don't make any assertive statements on those topics. And yet you decide to make assertive statements on things related to municipal infrastructure, which you clearly know nothing about. "I'm mad at this thing because of this even though it has zero impact on it." How logical.

Like I said, zero critical thought. Whenever you think to yourself "why can't humanity be better" the answer you should really realize is "because most of humanity thinks shallowly like me."

Bye Felicia.
>I also understand how the State and Federal government rapes the people of their hard earned money while letting a corp like Nestle make money for almost free.

Are you 14 years old? Edgy much?

> I know a gentleman in Northern Wisconsin who has to pay much more to the state to pump and bottle the water in his land, from the Lake Superior ground water. 

I doubt it. Wisconsin is part of the Great Lakes Compact and its policies fall in line with Michgans. They do not charge usage rates for privately owned systems. 

>What I am saying is the meager price they paid for access to the peoples water supply is ludicrous when you consider all the other ways they take money from the people.  



The water isn't "the people's." The water is part of the property Nestle owns and Nestle uses its own system to draw and treat it, it is not tapped into any municipal supply. You clearly don't get how this works.
>80,945 commenters were against the request. 75 were in favor.

This was passed by Republicans who were cashing the Nestles checks on their way to vote. You got sold out Michigan, you are going to regret it. 
They don't need permits here they just suck Canada dry on a 20 year expired deal.  Nestle is Lucifer's brother
Seeing this after reading an article this morning about a 5-7 mile wide plastic/trash field in the ocean really makes me sick. Do we not see the correlation here? Greed is just fueling these companies that end up poisoning the earth with their products.

Guess if people weren't stupid enough to keep buying these products they might stop pumping them out, or at least reduce production. 
Nestl√© [loves to sell leaded products](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maggi-exceeded-lead-content-violated-labelling-rules-Govt/articleshow/48436435.cms).  Will the vampires of Nestl√© get into your blood?  Boycott Nestl√©.

>In a press release, MDEQ director Heidi Grether stated, ‚ÄúIn full transparency, [the] majority of the public comments received were in opposition of the permit, but most of them related to issues of public policy which are not, and should not be, part of an administrative permit decision. We cannot base our decisions on public opinion because our department is required to follow the rule of law when making determinations."
Mike Moore (documentary filmmaker):

*"As Deep Throat told Woodward and Bernstein: 'Follow the money.' Snyder's chief of staff throughout the two years of Flint's poisoning, Dennis Muchmore, was intimately involved in all the decisions regarding Flint. His wife is Deb Muchmore, who just happens to be the spokesperson in Michigan for the Nestle Company -- the largest owner of private water sources in the State of Michigan. 
Nestle has been repeatedly sued in northern Michigan for the 200 gallons of fresh water per minute it sucks from out of the ground and bottles for sale as their Ice Mountain brand of bottled spring water. The Muchmores have a personal interest in seeing to it that Nestles grabs as much of Michigan's clean water was possible -- especially when cities like Flint in the future are going to need that Ice Mountain."* (published 02/01/2016)

In other words, the Flint water crisis was very good for bottled water sales - any wonder why the State of Michigan still hasn't fixed the problem?

I know what it says, but I would much rather see "Michigan withdraws Nestle's water permit approval."
In future decades, as clean water becomes an issue all over the world, you will regret this sorely. 
Personally, I've boycotted Nestle and don't buy bottled water from anybody. 
Not sure why people are saying fuck republicans as I'm sure of the 80,945 comments a lot were republicans. Do you think people have the ability to see the future of what their politicians will do when they vote them in? Always seems like american politics is about voting for the lesser evil, rather than voting for the good guy. Far too many politicians use their power to benefit themselves rather than their constituants. Sure would be nice if there were more laws about drinking water and other necessities which mandates there be an adequate amount and surplus for citizens before companies can profit off it. Bottled water is a nice thing as not every citizen has a way to store fresh water in case of an emergency, though the bottles used are apparently leeching chemicals into the pro duct.
Every elected official in Michigan has now lost my vote not just over this but over everything I know there are a couple good guys there but they failed to stop the bad ones so if you're in office good luck you lost my vote
The water race is going to be scary in the coming years
So the public gets lead poisoned water and the company gets fresh ground water. Seems reasonable in a political system run by lobbyists and big money.This is why I don't buy anything from Nestle or any kind of bottled water.
In other words - fuck you flint.
So there are people in that state without clean water in their homes and the government sells what is left of their clean water?

This will be great for the economy, eh?

Speaking as a Californian... Michigan will regret this.

Does Michigan have a lack of water? I think I am missing something here because I am having a hard time seeing how preventing Nestle from pumping up water somehow results in Detroit and Flint getting clean water.

Isn't democracy great? */s*
Following "the rule of law" when it suits your needs... 
Fuck you Nestle, leave our water alone.
This isn't a big deal Michigan has been digging deeper for fresh water for thirty years.    Once the world population hits 10 billion Nestle will be able to charge ten times what they do now.   None of that money will make it to Mi.   A bank in Switzerland will add a few zeros and the planet will continue to get drier.   All is normal here move along.
Welp, time to boycott nestle. 
Yet again proving that the governor cares more about money than his constituents‚Äô well-being. 
They should make them send every ounce they harvest to Flint until they have clean water.

So we need more water for chocolate than water for people.  Wow.
Fuck Nestle man. Such a terrible corporation. 
They'll just keep going until theres nothing left. We have to get people we know personally to the polls this year. Every vote counts.the Russian bots know that!
FUCK NESTLE. I wonder who they paid off, it is the PEOPLE WATER  FUCK NESTLE!
Why and how?! I am disgusted.
Nestle is like a slut at the glory hole, it finished California leaving it dry,  now moving on to Michigan.  This can't be happening
[deleted]
We do have the worlds largest supply of fresh water here in Michigan.  

My thoughts are that if nestle is adversely affecting the wells of local residents, the corporation should pay to dig them a deeper well.  

If nestle's operation does not negatively impact the local residents, then who cares how much water they use as long as they are in compliance with all the regulations?  

Lake Huron flows 1.4 million gallons per second down the Detroit river according to Wikipedia.  

Nestle's request of up to 6.6 gallons per second is barely a drop in the bucket.  
I have to get out of this god forsaken state. 
I can understand being angry if nestle was pumping out of an ancient aquifer that couldn't be replaced, but I'm pretty sure michigan groundwater is pretty shallow and it's a use it or lose it regime that's going to end up in the ocean anyway.
Ummh... okay -- is there some amount of water that can be removed from Michigan in such a way that it will effect anything? Isn't this simply creating jobs in Michigan,. just as if they were bottling air, or hope.. or anything else that was more or less infinitely supplied 
Im not super knowledgeable of the water business, but isnt the infrastructure and capital investment pretty expensive to get a water distribution network to get set up? I cant imagine the margins in selling water even if its given to your for free is terribly high
If only the permit was to get water from Flint Michigan...
Not as much as the other great lakes are going to.
Our democracy in action

How is this even possible? 


Democracy at work
Doesn‚Äôt California sell off most of its water to bottling as well? Even in a drought?
Someone has to give Flint clean water! Might as well sell it to them because as The CEO of Nestle says ‚Äúwater isn‚Äôt a right‚Äù. 
"Representative Republic"
From Michigan, our state government is corrupt af, we know.

The problem is that Michigan is gerrymandered to hell and back, so even though the state is split pretty much down the middle politically, Republicans dominate all branches of state government. And that's just ONE of the issues with our state government. Then there's all the sneaky shit they pull to undermine the will of the people when we actually try to fix things with popular referendums. 

A lot of my fellow Michiganders (our word, you can't use it) are pissed off enough that I'm hoping for a reckoning come next election.
Yeah they've been voting up hard right politicians for years.  Same story as the rest of the states that do it.  They campaign on social issues and just do what their rich donors want once in office, and their constituantcy can't or won't do anything about it because they get all their news from Fox or their Sinclair-owned station.  The cycle continues.  Democrats?  Just gerrymander them out. Look what happened to David Bonior.
 Will it still be ironic if it burns down or will it be arson? 
God, those politicans are so damn stupid, its unbelievable. 
Is it not possible for 75 arguments to be better than 80,945 non-sensical arguments?

It isn‚Äôt a vote here. There wasn‚Äôt good reasoning. This was the same problem with net neutrality and the FCC. 
Can we just drop the party lines already? It's getting effing tiring. It's wrong, period. I don't give a shit which party's responsible. (And no, I'm not a Republican.)
By creating a lot of good jobs ?
this is a dumb comment, as if the party crap has anything to do with it. Democrats and republicans both would sign off to get paid. 

Fuck this, let nestle go down, who gives a fuck if there are less sodas to make people fat.
How many commented in a way that was valid for consideration under the law?

Very few.
Haha you blame republicans for Nestle increasing production.  So you must really hate Dems for what they did to Detroit.
Ooh, I love ginger ale. 
I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but for the sake of accurate information I'll post it anyways.

1. The permits being expired is irrelevant. SOMEBODY is entitled to the permit for use, and until the government reviews and re-issues it, Nestle is still legally entitled to pump water.

2. They pump less than 60% of what they are entitled to, and it has no impact whatsoever on the water levels of the Aberfoyle spring.

HERES THE BIG ONE:

Nestle accounts for 0.6% of the water usage in the Aberfoyle region. The biggest users? Golf courses at 25%+, and the municipal government to wash gravel for roads at 32%. Number three? Farms.

So while we're talking about protecting our natural resources, maybe we should shut down all the golf courses we all love so much (myself included)?

People need to actually do research before buying into sensationalist media bias so hard. I'm not saying these corporations are in the right, but at least portray accurate information.
Taking Flint's problem and bringing it to the people!
Same thing in California.

Yeah, let's not forget Nestle's [history.](http://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6) 
5-7 miles? Hah that's funny. Wait till you hear about the one that's the size of Texas.
Don't google "ocean garbage gyres"
It's ridiculous. If you are lucky enough to live in a first world country with clean water, you don't need bottled water. And there are loads of water filter products out there if you're particular about the taste of your water.
No, people are stupid and vote for those that are able to be paid off by those who will profit from this. 
I got an RO system for my house and a good hydro flask. for about 4 years now and it is still considered one of my best investments
So lets stop buying Nestle? It would only take one big reddit post and a few big instagram posts put a dent in their earnings. What all do they make? 
Yet at the same time I want to punch people who bring home cases of bottled water. Especially when the tap water is safe and tastes good. Just buy it in gallon jugs if you're better than the rest of us.
We should reeeeeealllyyyy go back to glass if it's possible and start developing bio-degradable plastics...
Everytime I see a family buy 4 24-packs of nestle water a week for groceries I die a little inside. I just want to rip it out of their hands and yell at them. It's sheer stupidity.

Even if you don't have clean tap water, just buy the big jugs and refill a bottle. It's less work once you realize you don't have to deal with a fuck ton of garbage every week.
I tried.  It's impossible to boycott Nestle.  Even if you can figure out which brands are actually owned by them, they're so pervasive it's unreal.
They are not getting it from Flint Michigan are they?
is it technically a boycott if you're avoiding it for health reasons? 
Flint gets their water from the Detroit River, same place everybody else in this part of the state gets it from. It's fine until it gets there.

There were already rumors about it before this was in the news. He needs to bring jobs in and their was a story saying he traded Nestle water for like 31 jobs or something ridiculous like that. 
>
The MDEQ determined the application meets the requirements for approval under Section 17 of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, 1976 PA 399, as amended (Act 399), which is required to produce bottled drinking water if the water is from a new or increased large-quantity withdrawal of more than 200,000 gallons of water per day from the waters of the state.

> ‚ÄúIn full transparency, the majority of the public comments received were in opposition of the permit, but most of them related to issues of public policy which are not, and should not be, part of an administrative permit decision. We cannot base our decisions on public opinion because our department is required to follow the rule of law when making determinations,‚Äù Grether added.

This is the important part.  I think this is a bad deal, but it really looks to be out of the DEQ's hands.
sooooo... now we need a democratic process to stop the silliness of for-profit water extraction from public resources altogether. call your reps.
Feigned outrage. It doesn't affect the water in Flint, but Flint still doesn't have clean water so I think selling water to Nestle that is clean while charging the residents of Flint for water they can't drink may come across as not so great. Though again totally legal. 
Only one party is at fault.  "I hate all incumbents" is how we got here in the first place.
No kidding, but Michigan voters have oftentimes been misinformed also voter turnout is not that great at the state level. 
They essentially are when they shop their produce... 
Water in that part of the country is essentially an infinite resource. Furthermore, they don't ship water all over the country from this one plant, that would be retarded for shipping reasons. This is a regional bottling plant that supplies the region. Even if that weren't true the water would almost always be going somewhere where water is more scarce than Michigan. You're complaining about the equivalent of a small stream.
Why do you think these two things are related? Nestle didn't put the dangerous pipes in the ground or change the water treatment chemicals that messed with those pipes in the water. Nestle isn't responsible for the Flint water issue in any way shape or form. Thinking that because two things are geographically near each other that they must be connected is the way a small child's mind works. Are you sure Flint even exists if you can't see it right now?
Damn. Didn't see that story. There has to be some crazy coverup going on at this point that none of us saw coming. 
Huh, turns out I don't use much of any Nestle products... TIL.
It's also helpful to let them know that you are boycotting, and why. 
I'm gonna miss those crunch bars
I like their products, I'll keep buying.
When you factor in their money it is really simple math
Pretty much if they would have denied it Nestle would have gone to court and won their case because it's the law. 
Because for the problem to be fixed 100% basicly would need to replace every pipe in flint. That is a mind numbing job and the residents won't be happy to see their streets and house ripped apart to replace them. Then there is the cost and the contracts which is a whole other beast.
>Do you think people have the ability to see the future of what their politicians will do when they vote them in?

I expect people to see basic patterns.
*Do you think people have the ability to see the future of what their politicians will do when they vote them in?*

Sorry can't agree.  The parties have basic principles you're aware of going in.  There's only one party that's gone off the rails.
We can finally make [Solarbabies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarbabies) a reality.
How do you figure?
You're an idiot.
That would have been a funny conversation.  

"Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny -- were they millionaires?"

"No."

"Well, your Uncle Nestle is. And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were here, they would furnish you with a whole house HVAC system, which your Uncle Nestle is more than happy to do."
Honestly, their chocolate is hardly the best anyway, but most American chocolate is inferior unless you find some artisans around town that make it directly from the bean and don't over process it. 
The time to boycott them was awhile ago. Take a look at this video showcasing how Nestle does not believe water is a human right:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iGj4GpAbTM#t=2m6s
How does this impact the wellbeing of anyone in Michigan?
They get their water from the same source that Flint does. Flint pumps theirs through poisonous pipes and Nestle filters, treats, and bottles their own.
None, this isn't a public opinion driven decision. This is an administrative agency that is bound to follow the law. Nestle has demonstrated that they are entitled to the permit under the law of the state. 
Bottled water accounts for 0.6% of all the water consumption in the state of michigan, total water consumption in the state of michigan is a tiny percentage of the maximum sustainable rate. Nestle would have to start bottling millions of times more water than they are right now to pose a threat to the local water tables, and they'd have to stockpile those bottles rather than sell them too because bottle water winds up in the same place as water coming out of your tap does, back in the water cycle. Your moronic fear mongering is no different from the Russian bots.

Do you live in Michigan? Wisconsin? Canada? Minnesota? We will keep our own counsel on what the hell we want going on in the great lakes and this sure as hell isnt it.

If you do live here, then you wouldn't take what we have here for granted, and you wouldn't be defending Nestle.
there's a whole lotta this going on in this thread.  they won't even listen to anything that simply explains the situation if it doesn't blatantly, unabashedly, and expressly support their "corps are EVIL!!!!!!!" position.  
But they're not pumping Lake Huron water. They're pumping ground water. And the only thing they've paid to the people of the state of Michigan  is a one time $250 permit fee to pump, bottle and profit off of our water forever. 
You should read about the toxic plumes in Michigan's groundwater that were caused decades ago by now-defunct businesses that can't be held accountable.  Ordinary citizens are *always* stuck with the mess when public resources are tapped for private gain.
>We do have the worlds largest supply of fresh water here in Michigan.

Pretty sure that would be Lake Baikal which has 22-23% of the world's fresh water, more than the Great Lakes combined. 
Stay and help us all make it better. We need people here to defend michigan from this crap.

What? Bottling is extremely cheap and profitable. 
Compared to water, pop is highly processed, but there is still a huge profit in that.
> I'm not super knowledgeable of the water business

Then don't bloody talk about it.
The per-unit contribution margin is extremely high but so are distribution costs. 

If a 24 pack of water sells for $2.50 to a retail outlet and a pallet contains about 80 packs (ballpark, I'm going off of very old memory here) a single pallet is worth about $200 and weighs about 2,100 pounds. A standard 53' trailer can carry about 24 skids meaning that the wholesale value of a trailer full of bottled water is about $4,800 and weighs about 25 tons. That's a rather small amount to start with, then transportation costs such as fuel, driver wages, vehicle maintenance, packaging (not bottling), loading, etc...

It is a profitable business, but lets not pretend that for every $2.99 pack of water $2.89 goes into some fat cat's pocket.
I'd imagine a lot of the bottles will be used in Flint 
They get their water from the same source as Flint and their consumption has absolutely nothing to do with the water problems in Flint. Flint has old pipes that poison the water that passes through them. The Nestle factory that bottles the water uses the same water that goes through those pipes.
Ok...Im going to say this up front, because most of this post is probably going to be a rant, and I don't want it to be misconstrued...I agree this is a bullshit move, and shouldn't have happened...that being said:

Fuck you and the other great lakes states.

You know who foots the bill for maintaining the lakes? Michigan. You know who spends the most on research regarding the health and stability of the lakes? Michigan. You know who constantly asks for help in covering this massive expense, and yet never gets anything in the way of help? Michigan. You know who NEVER pays for ANYTHING regarding the lakes? EVERY OTHER GREAT LAKE STATE.

We pay for them, the lakes are ours. Y'all can go fuck yourselves. Nestles too.

Democracy: The US illusion.
> Our democracy ~~in action~~

Is in danger

A turnout of 81k people should not be able to decide policy in a state of 10 million. That's what the elections are for.
Well, it's the best you can buy.
You need money to win, and you don't have enough.
Vote with your dollars!
Obtain money . THEN. you can hang with the big boys. 
Fuck politicians in general. I've yet to meet one I truly trust.
Yeah because democrats have NEVER sold out their voters. Stupid sheep. 
the story is the DEQ can only reject the permit if it would impact the water table in some significant way and the truth is it probably won't and all the science tends to agree that whatever they pull out of the well will be replenished from the nearby lake.

if the DEQ had rejected it then Nestl√© could just sue them and pretty much any judge would agree with them. 

I'm not happy about it but people in this state keep voting for the same damn state legislators, so fuck em. ain't gonna screw up my water. 
I am particularly interested since it is my state but I will look shit up if lets me show people how shitty the Republican party is for the world anyway. 

I did some searching, and I couldn't really find any information on the approval of the permit, not even that it was voted on by a council of people or not. In fact, the permit isn't even to draw directly out of the Great Lakes as many in the comments are suggesting but from a well in a town. 

The director of the MDEQ (which approved the permit) was appointed by Rick Snyder and previously worked for Amoco and BP, so chances are that she is, in fact, a piece of shit, however. 

Overall I'd say that this probably isn't as bad as others are making it out to be, but there are of course issues and moral questions about selling water extremely cheaply to a company to have it bottled and sold for a huge markup when the population of Flint went without clean water for so long. 

The people in this thread seem to be claiming what they think as fact and just making wild assumptions, unless I missed something when I was searching for information.
From the articles you posted Governor Granholm helped Nestle get a stay of the court order until the well water rights could be handled in legislation.  The bill presented by the Republicans (Republican State Rep. Aaron Miller's House bill 5638) didn't address the issues and instead gave Nestle what it wanted.   **By simply reading what you presented your first sentence isn't true.**  It misrepresents what happened.
Did you read the articles you linked? I ask because they blow your weird alt right gaslighting out of the water. No offense but you seem confused about the issue. It's literally as if you have no idea what you're ranting about, and you have no idea how the Courts work. But keep gaslighting, comrade.


Except it's connected to several other states and even another country. It's not a Michigan resource, it is a regional resource. More important than the actual water we're talking about is precedent. 
The problem isn't the people. The problem is a system that allows people to choose between making tons of extra money for themselves and their loved ones or doing what they should do for strangers.
Last time I tried to vote in Michigan (November 7, 2017) there wasn't a single polling station open in my tri-county area, and I suspect the entire state. The Clerk of Courts told me that "We only vote on even number years, 2017 is an odd year so there's no polling today.", 30 minutes later the person at the Township Hall (Where the Polling Station should have been that day) told me that our county only polls when there are State issues on the ballot, and since it was local only there's no polling.

I had a copy of the State and county ballot (For Nov 7, 2017) on my phone during both of these conversations, as well as a "Top 10 Tips Before Voting on Nov. 7" article on mlive.com (Michigan's State Website). So there I stood, awake and trying to vote on something I am passionate about and on a few new (hopefully) less corrupt officials, completely unable to do so. It appears that last November, the people who run Michigan decided they weren't going to let anyone but themselves vote, so they blanket passed all the bills/re-elected all the cronies.
Everything you said is completely true, but everybody should also not fool of themselves and remember that a good portion of the Democrats we've had in office for the last several decades aren't a hell of a lot better than the Republicans as far as the shady under-the-table deals go... Yeah they made policies that we are more inclined to agree with, but they haven't exactly made us a shining beacon of hope in the world or else we wouldn't be in the situation we're in today.

We need to all go vote and actually vote in candidates who take zero corporate money and are willing to make a pledge to continue to take zero corporate money even after elected.
You spelled cocksuckers wrong. Assholes. 
I was wondering the same thing. I thought all states and Canadian territories with access to the Great Lakes water shed must be under agreement before an outside entity can extract water from the GL water supply.

This is exactly how representative government works. 

There are close to 7.7 million people of voting age in Michigan, so 80,000 is less than two percent of voters (assuming they all were Michigan voters).

I think it's pretty safe to say that most of the people complaining didn't vote for the Republican representatives who now hold power. The people who elected those representatives probably don't care at all about this issue.
Yea not direct democracy

FIFY, it was the people who put those aholes in office.


Yes, it was the same problem with the FCC, namely that there were tens of thousands of dissenting voices and they were never heard.
No actually we can't. When one party is intent on destroying our society and destroying our environment for profit only the simple minded and cowards sit on the fence.
Missed that whole part where Nestle was bringing all the jobs to Michigan. Is that kind of like all those job that the Keystone XL pipeline was going to bring to N. Dakota?
>let nestle go down

It's not Nestle that is going to be the one suffering, that's the point you missed.

>who gives a fuck if there are less sodas to make people fat

It's bottled water...how did that fact escape you? It's in the fucking headline?!?
>How many commented in a way that was valid for consideration under the law?

All of them? What does 'valid for consideration under the law' mean? A public comment period is just that, a bit of time for the public to comment, not a single comment needs to be considered by the agency issuing the decision after the comment period is up, regardless of how the comments are crafted.
This is a dangerous type of thought process that we saw with net neutrality. Just because a subset were illegitimate doesn't mean you get to disregard the overwhelming trends of the data 
I'm trying to make it look like I'm working. I can't have you making me laugh at my crotch at work. My wife does that enough
> So while we're talking about protecting our natural resources, maybe we should shut down all the golf courses we all love so much 

Not that that would even make sense because the total water use in the region is still a tiny fraction of the sustainable level. Water is essentially an infinite resource in this part of the country. The demand for water would have to skyrocket in order for any total use regulation to be actually binding.

But flints problem is in infrastructure not water supply?
Just referencing the article that was on the front page today. Read days before that several countries in Asia are big parts of this ocean plastic/trash problem.
Twice the size of texas now. They measured it wrong the firat time, apparently.
TWICE the size of Texas.  TWICE.
Alot of us have poor quality water high in sulphur or nickle and cant afford a thousand dollar filter 
Which is basically most politicians today. I can't really name one that hasn't taken corporate handouts. 
I have a lrivste well, but I always drink ro water.  

At work, we have Detroit water, but still only drink ro water.  Have you seen the water that comes out of a fire hydrant?  You're crazy to drink that!
The ONLY time I buy bottled water is when I go on a camping trip with no water access. That or I fill my 5 gallon camping jug and fill cups from that. 
It's not impossible. I've been doing it for 4-5 years now. Sure, I've messed up, but now I don't even think about it. It's second nature for me now to know and avoid all the products. There are even apps like Buycott where you can scan the barcode of a product and it will tell you if it goes against your cause.
Yep. I live in Asia and there stuff is everywhere here too. 
just avoid their big ticket items? they probably make most of their profits from bottled drinks anyway. Nobody's perfect and  if there's only one brand of a cocoa powder at your supermarket what are you going to do?
The problem was they changed where they got the water from and the pipes are what lead to the water poisoning. They need to re-do the entire piping in the city which is expensive and they still haven't done it. I'm in one of the Flint Water groups on FB and they're getting billed for water they can't even drink. 
Isnt fine when it gets there too?

I'm gonna have to research...but I thought lead levels in flint returned to below the threshold a while ago.  

31 jobs 5 for his biddies who make six plus figures and 25 for minimum wage that do all the work. 
So I live in the Michigan area, and I was wondering what reps to contact about this? I'm ready to rip into someone over this and I want to make sure I'm sending angry emails at people I should actually be angry at. 
If you want to shut down a major employer and tax payer in the state for no good reason that's your business. Nestle's water consumption has absolutely nothing to do with the Flint water issue, nor does it have any negative impact on the water supply in the area. This isn't a region of the country where they have to worry about droughts. 
Selling? probably not. Nothing indicates Nestle is paying for this.

But no, the two things are not related. Flint gets its water from the Flint river.  Nestle is pumping from the underground aquifer. And is probably better at chemistry than the political appointees in Flint that caused that fiasco. 
It's the same water. Nestle just has the advantage of not having lead pipes. And if you are still consuming water even though you know it's not clean, why wouldn't you be charged for it?
It's the same water. Getting mad at them for this is like getting mad at your boss for letting your coworker drink from the water cooler because the water cup that they bought themselves is clean and the water cup that your other boss gave you is full of human shit. Get mad at them for not giving you a clean cup, not for letting someone else pull from the same nearly infinite source of clean water that you are. The two things are totally unrelated. Given that this is a state regulatory administrative agency and the people responsible for the decision have absolutely nothing to do with the people in Flint who made the decision that fucked up the water in Flint this outrage makes absolutely no sense.
We need to hold our representatives responsible for their decisions. Our representatives should be protecting the things that make Michigan great. Please explain your comment. Giving Democrats a free pass for being complict in this travesty will not allow for the change we clearly need. We need to send a message.
The ruling class who own the politicians is what got us here.
look at the water it takes to grow almonds.
I wanted to make that same point. If you don't like it...don't buy their water. I guess that is the point of complaining though. .to raise awareness so possibly others won't buy it.
What products do they have that are that much better and/or cheaper than competitive businesses
 Edit: then to than
Sounds like a good JOBS JOBS JOBS program. Oh wait black people live there.

Agreed Hershey chocolate is awful I‚Äôm blown away anyone buys it
Well when you can buy everything you want why not charge everyone else and get richer? That's kind of the idea they're going off of. So sad especially when seeing parts of the world going through incredible harsh droughts right now. 
I knew about that but I didn't see that things have gone this far. Goddamnit. 
You realize youre defending nestle right? If youre down to waste your time you could at least get paid for it.
You can blow numbers down your dick honestly. People are running out of clean water while nestle is selling water from reservoirs around the U.S. that get low marks indicating contamination. What a coincidence that trump floats infrastructure spending. You should keep in mind that micro plastics are also contaminating water globally so we sure as fuck dont need more it bottled you incel.
Yeah seriously. The slut is providing a wonderful service and helping people. Nestle is just taking things for profit. 
You forget the 4 digit checks to corrupt politicians. Four fucking digits, maybe a few 5.
How much do you pay the state of Michigan to pump ground water from your private well?  I pay zero dollars.  

Granholm wanted to tax private wells but the proposal didn't go anywhere.  
If the ground aquifer feeds into or fed by the lake basin, there really isn't a difference.
You are correct. I googled and both Brazil and Russia have greater supplies of fresh water.     I worded my statement poorly.  

The EPA website says this, which is rather confusing:  "The Great Lakes are the largest surface freshwater system on the Earth. Only the polar ice caps contain more fresh water"
Umh.. people are getting jobs. Nestle's is a low profit company. We are the ones getting something for cheap. 24 bottles of water are a couple of bucks. Something that costs nothing and cannot be exhausted or even measurably decreased by tapping it is creating jobs in Michigan. We're getting extraordinarily cheap portable fresh water. 
Sell something worth pennies to idiots for dollars. Yup, the math checks out.
Walmart trailers can hold 28-32 pallets
Oh the irony.
They get nestle bottled water in lieu of actual water? Nestle water tastes like ball sweat
As an actual Flint resident, Nestle is the biggest piece of shit company on earth. In my eyes, Comcast doesn't shine a light on the shittyness of Nestle. They used our crisis to make money and I hope they all burn in hell for it. 
Are you implying that Chicago does nothing for the lakes? 

Also lmao at the "Lakes are ours". I did some basic googling but do you have any stats for in investments in the lake. 
Source? I'm pretty sure Wisconsin puts their fare share of money into Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
Source?

Because, how I see it, NYS bordering the two smaller lakes, foots a sizeable chunk of the bill.
Ohioan here, fuck Michigan!

Jokes aside, Ohio/Cleveland do a lot for Lake Erie too. 
Your post is bad and you should feel bad.  
What do you mean that Michigan is the only state that pays to maintain lake Michigan?  Do you have a source because I have been to a variety of talks about Illinois efforts to maintain the lake.  Is it all BS?
That's a great read.  The findings are backed up by the data in the book by Piketty, "Capital in the 21st Century."    
Also in video form titled "corruption is legal is America"
I think the US is more of a plutocracy. 

Citigroup even agreed.

Voters aren't able to decide policy at all. That's what lobbyists are for.
Actually you can have no money and win if enough people band together. Look at what boycotts have done. Nestle wouldn't be able to do this kind of crap if no one bought their products. The Supreme Court said that money is speech. Using large amounts of money to buy politicians is now legal through citizens united, and if money is speech, not spending it is speech as well and a Constitutional right. Poor people as well as rich still have the power to bring corporations to their knees if they just use it right.

Look out. We've got an edgelord over here.
There is a southern republican pedophile that needs your support. Better hurry.
I've said this before...I don't have a problem with them pumping water.  I have a problem with them doing it for practically nothing.
I'm not a fan of nestle but I happen to agree with you.  

The amount of water they are asking for is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things.   
Flint still doesn't have clean water.
I really think it's more of a moral issue. There's nothing illegal about this, it just seems disheartening considering not much has been done about the water in Flint at least not on a grand scale that and the city keeps having issues with corruption over and over again and keep fighting with the mayor. I believe they even ousted her at one point, I can't remember. Overall, I think the question is is it right to re-sell the water when not everyone in the state has access to clean drinking water? 
I'm not a fan of nestle, but I have no issue with a company following all the regulations and making money off of their bottling/transporting/marketing of an abundant resource.   

They are asking for the ability to pump up to 6.6 gallons per second.  That is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of water the lakes lose down the river every second.   

I know the groundwater is not the same as the actual lakes, but they are related.  
You douchebag, the democrats have been diverting water out of Michigan since 2003. Well before the republicans took over, and when the democrats had a supermajority.

> By simply reading what you presented 

Which you clearly fucking did not do. You did not read dick of what I posted.

*"The reason is that Ms. Granholm's rhetoric and decisions on water policy haven't matched up. During the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Ms. Granholm said she opposed mass water diversions outside the Great Lakes. Yet, in December 2003, as governor, she filed a legal brief siding with Nestle in its legal battle to pump, bottle, and sell spring water from Mecosta County. The governor's brief stayed a lower court ruling in November 2003 that said the Nestle operation was harming a nearby stream, wetlands, and the property rights of a neighboring landowner. The judge ordered the company to cease its operation."*

Yep. She totally wasn't helping the water companies divert!

That's a total misrepresentation! /s
> blow your weird alt right gaslighting out of the water.

I guess pointing out the facts that starting in 2002 a democrat state house and senate drafted a bill that allowed for what everyone is pissed about right now, that was then signed into law by a democrat governor is "alt right gaslighting"??? 

> No offense but you seem confused about the issue.

The issue is that faceless, multinational corporations are exporting the water out Michigan to the tune of billions of gallons a year for exorbitant profits while Flint bathes in and drinks lead. This was allowed for in the early 2000's by DEMOCRATS and signed into law in 2006, by DEMOCRATS. That doesn't mean I think republicans are good. In fact, they are both equally shitty and worthless. Both parties only care about corporations and profits. 

If you think the republicans are at fault because now, 12 years later, they raised the limit on the bill DEMOCRATS passed in 2006, then I would argue it is *you* that's confused by the issue. And that's mostly due to your bias. 

It shows. Your first assumption is that I am an "alt right gaslighter" just because I said "Granholm and the democrats are the ones that allowed diversion by law."

That's a pretty far jump, especially when I've said nothing about the right and I am sticking to the issue at hand.

> It's literally as if you have no idea what you're ranting about

Richly ironic. Because your identity politics have been triggered so hard by what I said, you fly off the handle in a blind fit of rage with personal insults, ad-homniem attacks, knee-jerk reactions and baseless ranting. 

> But keep gaslighting, comrade.

Keep using those catchy memed out buzzwords you saw on facebook, neo liberalist!
What precinct or county?
Huh, what a coincidence.
This is true. I'm from Michigan hence why I posted. I live in Cali now, but growing up it was under the Dems and under them, things got worse, under Snyder they still seem to be going bad. I think what citizens need to realize is it's not the party that matters, but who is lobbying those parties. I keep having this argument with people I went to school with, but in their mind one party is evil and the other is good because someone promised jobs will be brought back, but really what will save Michigan is innovation and new companies showing up the auto industry isn't going to magically come back and save it.  
Is there any?
Bold move for people to blame Republicans in Michigan when Detroit was fucking sank by Democratic leadership for decades. Bold move. 
We were being charged penalties in California for going above a certain water usage because of the drought, while they ship out water out to be bottled. And we are a Democratic state, im pretty sure politicians from both sides are selling us all out.
They were heard, it is just that what they said had no no value because it was just conclusory opinions with no argument or substance. 

They are trying to make an informed decision. A yes or no answer does not help them. 
Both parties are pretty intent on it. And FYI It's pretty shitty to chuck insults simply because our views don't align though. Such shitty comments are why we can't have constructive political discussions in this subreddit. 
fuck bottled water then....happy now?

I get my water from tap water I filter, who gives 2 shits.
Read the article. It specifically addresses this as a problem with.the comments.

That a comment is made by the public does not mean it us due for consideration.
Exactly my point.

It's ridiculous the amount of fuss people are making over Nestle's water usage, because in reality, it's nothing.

But the media loves a villain.

Not heading towards. It already exists.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch

Just look at the estimates of size
There already is and has been for years a patch of garbage the size of Texas in the ocean. (It's probably way bigger now.) It's been nearly a decade since I first heard about it...
Do you have a link to that article/reddit post?
Every ocean has a garbage patch. They get caught in the gyres. 5-7 miles is small. The pacific garbage patch really is the size of Texas, and growing.

Some of these plastics are from as early as the 60s/70s. The US definitely contributes, as does countries in Asia. The problem is, nobody wants to take the lead on mitigation/cleanup because "well, other countries add to it, too". Its a giant blame game.

Also, people knew about the Pacific garbage patch in the 90s. Its been frustratingly slow for awareness of the garbage patches to catch on.
Actually, its grown since they 1st measured it. People have known about it for a very long time.
We had 2 nitrate warnings in our city water, it was nice to know that our RO system was guaranteed to block out more than 85% of nitrates. Especially when giving it to infants.
Same.  I do everything possible to avoid their shit. Been at it for a little over a year.  It's totally doable.
Thanks for mentioning Buycott, I just downloaded it. I was about to buy a Kitchen Aid mixer but eff that now.
I didn't know about that app I'll have to download it for sure. 
I do the same but its actually quite suprising how many companies belong to nestle itself. I swear, I can barely buy cereals because they own almost every second brand in the store
If it makes you feel any better, I believe they've sold their candy brands to Ferrero Roche. Not sure if that applies internationally or just in the US.
"For 18 months, data has shown that Flint's water quality is restored and testing is the same or better than many cities across the state and country," Keith Creagh, director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, said in a news release.
Yes the issue is with the lead pipes inside individual houses. The city's water is fine.
Private testing has contradicted that. 

Also, still advised not to drink it. The pipes still need to be replaced.
Ah, sweet, locally bottled, lead free capitalism! 
mmm goes down smooth. 
not in or from the area, so not sure who to rip into. but it's a federal, and really an international problem. multicorps like Nestle are buying the world's public resources and sell them back to us at a profit, adding a bunch of plastic and footprint along the way. 

you should be very angry indeed at anyone who takes money from said profit. 
You're right it has nothing to do with flint, but that doesn't mean people can't still be outraged. The permit they got is $200 per year and they get to pump out as much water from the great lakes that they want. The Great Lakes are every bit as much of a national treasure as Yellowstone and they should be protected. This was universally hated in Michigan regardless of party, and this needs to be changed. According to Nestle's own website they only employ around 280 people in the state fyi.
where do you see me saying this has to do about Flint? you are assuming. I'm merely saying that for-profit exploitation of a common good is immoral, jobs or no jobs.

edit: and I would LOVE to see the tax bill of Nestle. that point costs me a mild chuckle.
Not "politicians".

republicans.  

Their water is pretty dope. 
They have been working on the project continuously since the problem became apparent. Huge public works projects don't happen overnight. 
It's alright for Smores, but yeah it's not like "I must have this". Best chocolate I've had was out of Belgium anyway and in Japan. Japan has some good chocolate too very creamy. 
Those private wells are in Michigan.  Is the water Nestle pumps going to stay in Michigan and be used in-state?
What people? What jobs? Do you live anywhere near here? Do you know anything about ecology? Do you know anything about NESTL√â?? That'd be a great place to go start. 
You don't know how labor econ works, nor do you know how to compute *actual* job creation and not just job mobility across industries, which is more than likely what will largely happen here.  Moreover, jobs are not the end in themselves.  If you think they are, I'll pay you $0.10 per hour to clean my bathroom, and you shouldn't complain because I'm creating a job.  Jesus Christ.
[removed]
Sure.

Like I said in my post, I'm going off of old memory. I used to work as a manager in a grocery store eons ago.

If memory serves me correctly a standard 53' trailer can fit 30 40"x48" pallets wide-wide which is a huge pain in the ass for any outlet that doesn't have a ride-on forklift. However, a full load of water would exceed the weight limit of a triaxle semi-trailer and local road regulations may reduce the permitted load further (often 5 tons per axle).

My numbers are rough but they're in the ballpark.
No, the leady. If they had iron pipes we wouldn't have the issues there lol
It's not ironic when its by design. 
Probably not only nestle bottled water. I think Costco is cheaper
And more contaminated with plastic particulates than any other company
I think he is
Or Cleveland? Cleveland has worked hard and is continuing to work hard to keep Erie clean.
I'm sure Michigan does a ton for Lake Ontario too

You must have stepped out of a time machine from 150 years ago, because a lot of stuff has happened between then and now that shows Marx didn't know dick.
Oh boy, it sure must take a real genius to point out that some individuals will collude with the government for their own benefit....

> Good thing were a constitutional republic....edit: not sure why people are downvoting a fact...

People are downvoting it because the two (democracy / republic) are not mutually exclusive. Most republics are democracies and most democracies are republics. A republic (from *res publica* or "public matter") is nothing more than a nation that isn't ruled by a monarch. In most republics, the head of state and other members of the ruling body are elected by the citizens.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic):

> In American English, the definition of a republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body[2] and exercise power according to the rule of law under a constitution, including separation of powers with an elected head of state, referred to as a constitutional republic[4][5][6][7] or representative democracy.[8]

Constitutionally-limited Republic
I down voted it because it's irrelevant and adds nothing  to the conversation
Because you clearly don't know what those words actually mean. They don't preclude you from being a democracy. 
My guess is because it says ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù in it.
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
They're still more legitimate than a turnout of 81k
Lobbyists give campaign funds so candidates can persuade voters to go vote.. if voters had the impetus to go vote without any external persuasion then lobbyists would have little to no power
> Nestle wouldn't be able to do this kind of crap if no one bought their products.

I've been boycotting them for a decade and the one takeaway is.... we've allowed these companies to grow too large for free market rules to apply (without a significant coordinated effort made by a very large group).  You'd be amazed how many shelf items at your grocery store are owned by them at some level.
Wouldn‚Äôt have happened if the dnc hadn‚Äôt of cheated for Hilary. (I‚Äôm neither republican nor democrat)
Oh you poor uninformed soul. The dems do all the same stuff as the repubs. Or did you not pay attention to the primaries in 2016?
yes the comment I wrote to the DEQ was basically approve the permit but apply a 100000$ regulatory fee annually.

or something like that. I never expected them to do anything but I'm still disappointed.  
This is my main beef with Nestl√© too and the same thing is going on in BC. Here they pay a whopping $2.25 for every one million litres of water extracted. Given how much they profit, I think they could stand to be paying more and that money could in turn be used for water conservation. Honestly, bottled water should be banned in place's where potable water exists. I understand it's need for emergencies but otherwise it's such a waste.
In 10-15 years you will have a problem with them pulling water and the fact that looking back to now, you didn't have a problem with it. [The Great Lake Water Wars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175820.The_Great_Lakes_Water_Wars) have already begun. 
I basically just have a problem with Michigan rolling over like bitches and not charging Nestle a bunch of money for the additional usage and expanded water rights. 
The water is clean it's their lead pipes that are the issue. Turns out it takes a long time to physically replace every single lead pipe in the city.
How's Puerto Rico doing, btw?
I agree it is more of a moral issue, I just didn't like people in the thread spreading disinformation about the situation. 
They are two completely separate issues.  

If a private individual or business in the state wants to drill a private well; then build infrastructure to pump, filter, and bottle the water, they can do this as long as they follow the proper guidelines.   

It has nothing to do with the incompetence of the government in flint.  
Did you take the short yellow bus to school?
Again from the article that was the entirety of what she did, all of it. 
> Because your identity politics have been triggered so hard by what I said, you fly off the handle in a blind fit of rage with personal insults, ad-homniem attacks, knee-jerk reactions and baseless ranting.

You are describing yourself here.  You immediately started with personal insults like "you douchebag" etc.   

> It was actually the neo-liberal, corporate democrats before Snyder that sold them out and down the river:

I objected to your saying that this was a problem caused by the Democrats (plural) and then you can only point to the one incident  by Granholm as evidence that this is a problem caused by all Democrats.  

You haven't made a convincing argument.  You've personally attacked everyone who disagreed with you.   You and I agree more than we disagree but one reading this would never know that from reading this.   I took the time to read all the articles through all the links you posted.   They don't support your original statement any more than the first set did.    

The original bill established that limits were needed.   From your statements you object to the existence of the original bill completely.   You are ignoring that the current GOP legislature perverted that bill to allow massive private use of the public water.

You are misrepresenting what happened to blame Democrats.   What you are doing is like blaming the gutting of the EPA by the GOP on the fact that the EPA exists at all.    Gaslighting




Republicans = Corporations. Dems = People. Don't forget it.
I was able to personally confirm this for Crawford and Otsego counties, and am fairly certain Roscommon (as well as most of the rest of the State)
Not in Michigan it seems. : /
Detroit was sank by many things, corrupt leadership being just one of them.
That's what I'm currently trying to remind everybody of every single chance I get.. If we're all going to go out and vote like we say we are then we need to vote for completely new leadership. That doesn't necessarily mean we'll get it right next time either, but if we go voting in the same old guard, or at least the people that the same old guard tells us to vote in, we're not going to be any better off... it'll just look and feel like we're better off on the surface like always. Just like a Hillary presidency would have looked and felt if Donald hadn't won... We would think everything was a lot better right now, but in reality we would be sold off just as quickly, just without a tweetstorm about it.
Trying to use the infantile "both sides are bad" argument is why we can't have legitimate discussion. 

>Nice whataboutism.

Says the guy using whataboutism to deflect the issue. Screw you.
Is there some prize for stupid that you are trying so hard to win?
I think the problem isn't that nestle is using water, the problem is nestle is buying our water on the cheap just to sell it back to us at a profit. Not to mention the absolutely fucked up shit they do overseas.  
you misunderstand, the problem isn't their water source, but the infrastructure of the water distribution.
You're wrong. Flint and Nestle are both drawing from an essentially infinite water supply. The underground river they draw from could support hundreds if not thousands of times more consumption with no ill effects. The unused water just winds up becoming surface water, which is what happens to the bottled water eventually anyway.
Yeah but people make it sound like its a literal island of connected trash. It doesn't seem to be that way, however.

>"Its low density (4 particles per cubic meter) prevents detection by satellite imagery, or even by casual boaters or divers in the area. It consists primarily of a small increase in suspended, often microscopic, particles in the upper water column."
Why won't you be buying a KitchenAid mixer all of a sudden?  I'm unaware of any issues with Whirlpool Corporation.
You don't like whirlpool?
It is surprising and a little overwhelming at first, I'll give you that. Cereal was never a problem for me though. What cereals do they own? I think Kelloggs owns most of them. 
When they switched the water source they didn't treat it properly so it was corrosive to the water pipes and ate away at the protective layer that coats your pipes and prevents lead from being in your water. So when that layer was gone it started eating away at the lead and that led to the vast amount of lead in their drinking water. But now, even though they switched the sources back to a safer, non corrosive source that layer is still gone and it takes a while to build it back up. So yea, it's a shitty thing they did to the people of Flint.
It's from a well and groundwater not lake. No Great Lakes state/province can issue a permit for lake water by commercial use without getting approval from these guys http://www.glslcompactcouncil.org/ now. The states around the Great Lakes all signed a compact, so don't worry they're protected.
>  they get to pump out as much water from the great lakes that they want

This is straight up not true. You're lying to justify your outrage. You're  no better than the Troglodyte trump supporters on this website.

> they should be protected.

More dishonest bullshit. This nonsensical truism has absolutely nothing to do with the issue. You're whining about an absolutely tiny amount of the total consumption in Michigan and even the total consumption is nowhere near being unsustainable. 

> This was universally hated in Michigan regardless of party,

More lies from the dumbass trying to justify his own impotent outrage. A tiny percentage of the population of Michigan commented on something. Those people are morons. This is how moronic Berniebros convinced themselves Bernie could win just because of all the bots and astroturf they saw on reddit from Bernie's paid shills and Russian trolls. Populism is retarded. If you had your way gay marriage would be illegal and we wouldn't have the Affordable Care Act.
And if they did then all the housing, streets and some fields would be ripped/dug up. Where would they entire city go? Who would protect the areas under construction from theft and such? But no this guy jobs straight to race. I didn't see the whites at the Love Canal having it better in fact they had to leave.  
Yes. It's a regional bottling plant.
If they took 1 liter of the water for every person on earth from the Huron/Michigan system it would only be 1 millionth of the water in the lake. So maybe this only creates jobs and does not dissipate any resource.
They can't bottle water without creating jobs. Its not a possible thing. They cannot draw down the water table or create any deficiency in water in Michigan. People piss the water away... its not going anywhere. Water will turn to piss whether it is bottled first or not. Bottling it only means that folk are using less tap water and running it less. There's a net gain. Less water is processed for drinking if its bottled. 
You can get gallon jugs of water for like a dollar, that‚Äôs pretty good considering some people don‚Äôt even have clean drinking water
They are a pain in the ass to unload even with the fork lifts when the put the pallets side ways to fit more pallets in the truck
But then they‚Äôd have to worry about Magneto attacking! Obviously the Republicans made the best choice to protect those innocent people!
yeah isn't it like... a thousand times more than the next leading competitor who just got eviscerated for the amount of plastic particulates in their water?
Yeah what he was was really pretentious imo
Are, you saying he was wrong about the state being a tool of the bourgeoisie? Because judging by this article, he was right.
He was wrong about a lot of stuff and was right about a lot of stuff. Clearly the person who doesn't know dick here is you. 

Did you not read the above link about how our government only serves the interests of capital? 
That's not what I said and not what Marx wrote so feel free to read up on it and get back to us if you're having trouble understanding. 
The not-having-a-monarch part of "republic" might not be quite as important as the constitution part - the set of explicit limits of the power of the government.
So have I, but that is why I said if no one bought their products. If people did pull together they could move mountains.
No, the essential problem is that they're not paying FMV for the water and they're reselling it at a healthy profit.  If they were paying FMV, they wouldn't be pumping so much....nor would they make as much profit.


It's doubly fucked. Not only are they paying micropennies for the water, which obviously must be a valuable resource otherwise this international corporation wouldn't want to pilfer it. But they're also not paying the full cost of their product (the massive amount of plastic waste they manufacture), the environmental cost is offloaded to taxpayers or just ends up killing animals and who knows what else. It's fucking evil. 
They're getting away with this in California too...for nothing.

http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-nestle-water-20171221-story.html
Eh whole other set of problems there as well. 
I think it's mainly public discourse more so than any type of information. Those leaving information have been correct this is perfectly legal, though I will say this I'm not a fan of Nestle and how it goes about it's water permits they purposely get water on Native land in Cali so they don't have to deal with the state and they did this during our drought out here which caused even more people to get mad, but they were doing it legally. 
What happened in Flint was a state issue though and went back to Snyder it wasn't just in Flint and yes it's legal, but what I said is it comes across as morally disrupt hence why half the comments are basically saying fuck them, because Flint still has issues and the state is fine with selling water to Nestle before they figure out a way to get clean drinking water to everyone, but I guess it's fine they sell water to Nestle and Nestle then sells it to Flint residents. That's the idea that's floating around. Don't hate the messenger I'm just saying this is why people are mad. 
They are separate issues but linked.  They are linked by the fact that people write laws and the laws represent the values of the people writing them.

Do you really think taking 400 gallons per minute is the same as someone taking water for their house or their farm?   The permits fail to take into account the limits of a shared resource.   That's what should have been addressed in legislation but the Republican legislature failed
*"Oh no, valid facts and information formulated into a logical argument that's counter intuitive to my own personal ideology. Better call him a retard, backhandedly."*

(Checks post history, nothing but obsessive trump bashing.)

Yep. Checks out. Chill out on the identity politics. For your own health.
TheMacPhisto is so full of it. Michigan's Attorney General at the time was Michael Cox, the first Republican AG Michigan had since 1955. I'll betcha MacDipshit has no idea that State AG's are elected.
I would be willing to wager large sums of money that if it were a Republican that made the same moves that Granholm did in 2003, all of the talking heads on the left wouldn't let it go, ever.

But since it's a member of the party you most closely associate with, you dismiss it as "that's the entirety of it" like it's no big deal, even though that's not the entirety of it.

If a republican had promised during their campaign that they would prevent the water from being diverted (bottled and sold elsewhere) from the state which they represent, only to be elected and immediately file an injunction with the courts on behalf of a company that wants to do **exactly what the governor said wouldn't happen during their campaign**, we would never hear the end of it. And that's exactly what happened with Granholm in 2003. 

After Granholm's court injunction, it took the order of a different judge and a higher court to stop Nestle from Diverting and causing more environmental damage......

......Which was then promptly appealed by Nestle, and won *with assistance from the State Attorneys* office in 2005 which allowed them to keep pumping water. Granholm used the "Nestle provides 120 jobs to people [in the areas where water is pumped]" as justification for the move.

> that was the entirety of what she did, all of it.

This is abhorrently incorrect! In 2005, after Promising to not allow Nestle, or anyone else for that matter, to divert water during her campaign, then promptly going back on that promise after only 3 months in office, then filing an injunction/brief with the courts to allow water diversion to save 120 jobs (yay! /s) Granholm announced a "Moratorium" on water diversion permits. 

Sounds good, right? Like maybe she actually realized what was going on and decided to finally put her foot down, right? **NOPE!** This moratorium was announced and paraded around in a fanfare around the state as pretty much a tool of deception. You see, they did put in place a moratorium on water permits, however, only on NEW permits for Water Diversion. What does this mean? No competition for Nestle as they were the only ones at the time (2005) with Water Diversion permits in the state! Basically, this secured a monopoly on water diversion for Nestle indirectly via Democratic legislation!

Now, on Feb 28th 2006, Granholm capitulated to the pressure from the corporate lobbyists, and the corporatist state legislators and signed a bill that, for the first time, permits a multinational corporation to scoop up given amounts of the Great Lakes and sell bottled water across the world at a ridiculous markup. (2 million gallons a day, at nestle's markup is about a half million dollars a day in profit)

https://freepress.org/article/great-lakes-sale-michigans-odawa-indians-lead-anti-nestle-fight

Now like most Bills, there was a ton of shit crammed in there not even related to water. Fireworks legislation, a budget bill, and Senate Bill 850, which is the one we are concerned about: 

http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(lifyk0gvafmap4gz00n0ykjy))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=2005-SB-0850

http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2005-2006/publicact/pdf/2006-PA-0033.pdf

Here is a wrap up (TL;DR) of the bill: 

*To require a state groundwater withdrawal permit for users that withdraw more than two million gallons a day. The bill would require the Department of Environmental Quality to issue a permit within 60 days if the withdrawal will not cause an adverse resource impact or is from a confined aquifer. This is defined as an aquifer overlain by geologic material that has a low hydraulic conductivity and impedes or prevents vertical groundwater movement, and ‚Äúadverse resource impact‚Äù is defined as decreasing the base flow of a stream or lowering the level of a body of surface water such that it will no longer support characteristic fish populations. A permit application fee of $1,000 would be charged, and violations would be subject to civil penalties of $5,000 per day.*

I don't know about you, but 2 million gallons a day for each permit, doesn't sound like much protection at all. Not to mention that Nestle had received multiple permits in multiple pumping areas. And that was just Nestle. This bill allows for ANY corporation to come into Michigan, buy a permit, and start pumping water for ridiculous profit. Also, lets not forget the bill was sponsored by a bipartisan panel of mostly democrats, which then was voted in support of and passed by a democratic majority house and senate, then signed into law by a democratic governor!

And now, for the cherry on top. The insane amount of spin and misdirection on the official Michigan.gov announcement of this bill's adoption into law: http://www.michigan.gov/som/0,4669,7-192-29941_34757-137274--,00.html

**"Granholm Signs Landmark Legislation to Protect Great Lakes"**

*Governor Jennifer M. Granholm today signed legislation that for the first time protects Michigan waters from large-scale diversions and withdrawals. The landmark legislation fulfills a commitment Michigan made more than 20 years ago to join with other states and Canada to protect and preserve the waters of the Great Lakes Basin.*

###BULLSHIT.

> that was the entirety of what she did, all of it.

Yep. That's all. Nothing to see here. Please disperse while I claim that I protect the Great Lakes but actually allow foreign-based, multi-national, faceless corporations to pump three quarters of a billion gallons of water out of the state to be sold across the globe at insane markup and profit.

Tell me again how it's the republican's fault?
>  You immediately started with personal insults like "you douchebag" etc.

No, I "immediately started" with:

"It was actually the neo-liberal corporate democrats that sold michigan out"

I then backed that up with facts and evidence as to why I believe that. (Hint: Because democrats negotiated and signed the bills that allowed nestle to divert)

Then someone says "your first sentence isn't true." - *That's a douchebag move.*

How can you literally sit there, and click on the links and see the bills that were passed by a democratic state house, then passed by a split state senate and then signed into law by a democrat governor, 2 years before Obama even took office and 10 years before Trump was even a thought in anyone's mind and say "that's the republicans fault." - Or in the very least, say "It's not the democrats fault." ??? 

> I objected to your saying that this was a problem caused by the Democrats

Follow along. How is it NOT the democrats fault when, at the time, they controlled the state house and state senate and was the governor? How do you account for 2.5 million a year nestle spends lobbying? How do you account for the secret, behind closed doors negotiations between the granholm administration and nestle in the weeks leading up to the feb 28th 2006 SB 850 vote? How do you account for the rediculous amount of spin in the Michigan.gov article announcing the passing of that bill as "protection for michigan's waters" while the bill allowed for companies to pump out billions of gallons of michigan's water? How is any of that not the direct result of democratic control of a state?

Oh wait, I know, now, a whopping 12 years later, the Republicans that are now in control were successfully LOBBIED to raise the pumping limit of a bill the democrats passed well over a decade prior! IT'S TOTALLY THE REPUBLICAN'S FAULT, I FORGOT! WHOOPS! /s

> and then you can only point to the one incident by Granholm as evidence that this is a problem caused by all Democrats.

One? No. Try three. First she intervened in Evart situation to allow Nestle to keep pumping, which then required the order of another, higher judge to stop. 

Secondly, she issued a moratorium on all new water pumping permits, but only after issuing a handful to, guess who? NESTLE, and Nestle only! Essentially granting them a full on water diversion monopoly for a solid 2 years while the democratic state house and senate worked on drafting more comprehensive and sweeping legislation regarding that issue.

Thirdly, that bill that allowed *any company* to file a water diversion application, pay a nominal license fee and start pumping out 2 million gallons of water a day was passed by the democrats in the house and senate (and yes republicans did vote for it too) and signed into LAW by a democrat governor in Feb 2006. Not only that, the Granholm press people released a statement that spun the signing of this bill as "protection for the great lakes and michigan's water" - Which is total bullshit.

> You haven't made a convincing argument.

This is why you're suffering from a severe case of identity politics. I can, and have, literally plopped down a mountain of irrefutable facts, evidence and a timeline as to why I feel the democrats are responsible for Michigan's water diversion. Despite this literal pile of evidence that's screaming at you to investigate deeper than your bias will allow you to, you refuse to do so. You childishly dig your feet into the ground and pout "NO!" simply because you don't want to hear it.

> You've personally attacked everyone who disagreed with you.

You're generalizing a bit. And even assuming this was 100% true, it's not like I haven't been also putting up links, timelines and historical fact with actual events and detailed elaborations on why they are relevant. You can still personally insult people and be right. The two aren't mutually exclusive.

> You and I agree more than we disagree 

I will say that the same thing most likely would have happened with the Republicans in control of the state. However, at least the Republicans probably would have gotten more out of the companies requesting diversion permits than a $1,000 license fee.

> I took the time to read all the articles through all the links you posted. They don't support your original statement any more than the first set did.

Then you would notice they are clearly written from a left perspective, and I did that intentionally. There's a ton of grey language in those posts, but there's also important, accurate information as to the timelines.

> The original bill established that limits were needed. 

No, it actually established those limits and allowed, by law, for the diversion of water by any permit holder. You can start an LLC, buy water pumps, pay a $1000 fee and start pumping out water to the tune of 3/4 billion gallons a year, and to be sold for massive profit while Michigan gets nothing in return.

I am not in Objection to water diversion or the bill. My objection comes in the transaction. Michigan gets $1000, Nestle gets 3/4 billion gallons of water to sell at INSANE profit margins. 

You're telling me you think that's fair?

> You are misrepresenting what happened to blame Democrats.

Michigan gets $1000, Nestle gets 3/4 Billion gallons of water to sell at extreme profit.

The democrats (and republicans) voted to sell out to their corporate masters. The difference between them is that one party held veto power, while the other did not. I'll let you figure that one out.

Where's the misrepresentation? 

> What you are doing is like blaming the gutting of the EPA by the GOP on the fact that the EPA exists at all.

False equivalency.

 

Republicans = Corporations. Dems = Also Corporations.

###FTFY


I don't see any state ballots for Nov 7 2017. Roscommon didn't have any local elections that I can see. Grayling City in Crawford should have results but I can't find them. Ostego had a bunch: http://www.otsegocountymi.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20171107222415921.pdf
Lol alright. Take a look at the shit Democrats did and the shit Republicans did during their time in the presidential office and tell me that they're the same. Just because shit looks the same to you doesn't mean that changes aren't happening across the nearly 400 million population of US.
I'm not. This is an extremely serious issue. I avoid nestle products like the plague. What actually detracts from the issue is your making this about party lines. Address the issue. Don't make it about what you want. 
you already got it
The plastics dont decompose, but they do breakdown into smaller particles in the sun. Which is worse because then it is easily consumed by sea life. The volume of the plastic is immense, but it spreads instead of stacking on itself. It also takes up valuable surface area of tbe ocean that phytoplankton need, which is the major primary producer of the ocean.

It doesnt need to be dense to do damage.
so because you can't see it it's not really there? microscopic plastic particles in the food chain already reached human organisms. while I appreciate your care for accuracy I still strongly suggest to not have conversations about the size of the whole thing or its content but rather about what we can do. avoiding plastic altogether is a lovely start.
It‚Äôs fuckin trash bro. It shouldn‚Äôt be there regardless. Don‚Äôt play devils advocate

> they didn't treat it properly

To clarify they treated it improperly for the kinds of pipes that were in use. 
Hey how about instead of calling me a moron and a liar, you post some evidence that contradicts what I said. This may be the most arrogant response to anything if ever said on reddit. Also I live in Michigan, so fuck off with trying to tell me what percentage of people here care.
And are the profits being redistributed to the public?
Hahaha.



It's all fucking automated, bud! Running a pump and plant at max capacity doesn't add more than a dozen-ish jobs.


The world IS running out of fresh water and Nestl√© is getting it basically free with no return to MI. 


I can't even go on further with this, it's too dumb. Look it up yourself. 
The store that I worked at had a front-loaded forklift which had two wheels to side to keep it front falling over. It could lift a 40" pallet along the length but not a 48" pallet. We also had lift jacks but they couldn't fit under the width of the pallet.

Regular loads would often come packed wide-long and it was a simple matter of working the jack under the corner and brute forcing it 90 degrees. or removing the long pallet then the wide pallet with a little manoeuvring. However, I once had a full trailer of water arrive packed wide-wide for a sale. I had to send it away because i had no way of unloading it.

No, he wasn't.

> Did you not read the above link about how our government only serves the interests of capital?

You are typing your nonsense on a piece of capital more valuable than anything John D Rockefeller ever had access to. You just don't know how to use it as capital, and so it goes to waste.
Yes. I'm an environmental consultant in the great lakes. This is a massive deal and vastly complicated. You think Russia or the 2016 election was complicated? It's nothing compared to the politics of the water resources of the Great Lakes. We have states suing states and states suing companies and all kinds of shit going on that is incredibly important. I promise you, you will think back at this very conversation within 10-15 years.

Mainstream news does not cover environmental news barely at all. Like .001% of it.
From wiki: "In San Bernardino Nestl√© pays the U.S. Forest Service $524 yearly to pump and bottle about 30 million gallons, even during droughts." 

"I dunno, $500 seems kinda low to let you suck groundwater from our public aquifers like the soulless corporate vampires you are."

"OK, we'll throw in like 20 bucks worth of Kit Kats. And 2 bottles of crystal clear spring water."

"Deal!"
Could other water companies band together and sue based on the fact that they all aren't being charged equally?
The next school shooter should really just cool his heels until the next Nestle board meeting. 
you are a moron for linking an article that calls Republicans demons for what they do to the environment while trying to make it seem like it was democrats.
> After Granholm's court injunction, it took the order of a different judge and a higher court to stop Nestle from Diverting and causing more environmental damage......
> 
> ......Which was then promptly appealed by Nestle, and won with assistance from the State Attorneys office in 2005 which allowed them to keep pumping water. Granholm used the "Nestle provides 120 jobs to people [in the areas where water is pumped]" as justification for the move.

Do you read what you write, old man? Governor's don't make laws. Legislators do. Judges, do you know what they do? Do you not realize Michigan's Court of Appeals is CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN TO THE BONE? Did you not read your linked article? From the first paragraph:

"...the closed-door operating style of her predecessor, conservative Republican Governor John Engler. Mr. Engler was ruthless, secretive, and so intent on helping the state‚Äôs business community evade environmental laws that he encouraged his senior aides to regularly meet in private with executives to hammer out agreements that generally led to more ecological degradation."
So, I was (and am) a Crawford resident in 2017, that's where I tried to vote and received 2 separate false stories. There was a ballot for Crawford, there were no bills/proposals on it just people running for local office (this is one of the ballots I had a copy of on my phone). I grew up in Otsego county (I've actually known the current Mayor my entire life), spoke with 3 different people who were residents and were unable to find any open polling stations, all given similar B.S. excuses. You can see quite plainly in the results, the voter turn out was less than 15%, and if I'm reading it right pretty much unanimous for everything, which is what you'd expect if you don't open polls to the public.

I followed up on Crawford county the next week, and was able to confirm people were elected/re-elected for local positions on Nov. 7th, though I was physically present in both possible polling locations and not a single ballot/card/machine in sight.

The State ballot had, among other things, 3 separate proposals for Marijuana legislation, this is the main thing I wanted to vote on. I actually pulled them up from the State sample ballot first, then used the info there to research each proposal. One was quite simply to make possession, use, cultivation, etc a constitutional right and nothing more (no regulation etc, just blanket decriminalization), another was a recreational proposal with well thought out and common sense regulatory provisions/tax/logistic stipulations, etc, and the third was a bill revamping the former Medical Marijuana law (keeping it illegal) and introducing stricter regulations/restrictions on the current laws with oversight by a newly created "Board of Medical Marihuana Regulation" (full of retired police officers and anti-marijuana politicians). Guess which of those 3 bills the State passed on a day nobody could vote?  

I did some more digging, it looks like only a handful of counties in Southern Michigan were able to vote that day. Which still makes me wonder how there could be multiple people elected for State positions and at least one major State bill/amendment passed on Nov 7, 2017. It's unfortunate I didn't save the copies of my sample ballots, it seems other than news articles educating people on HOW to vote (no mention of what to do if there's no polling station!) and the results of that, anything about what was on the ballots is too difficult for me to find right now.

Because context matters. 
Also, surface area. Thats competing with phytoplankton abd inhibits light below it. In the open ocean, where resources are limited, thats huge
What‚Äôs wrong with devil‚Äôs advocate? The guy made it seem like it is a literal field of trash the size of Texas, which it absolutely is not. Dishonest exaggeration is bad regardless of whose side it‚Äôs coming from. This is just anti-intellectual.
That wasn't my intention. I was just trying to paint a more accurate picture, because I expected to see like a literal landmass and I'm sure many others did too. Sorry if I've somehow offended you. I do agree trash does not belong in the ocean. I wasn't even suggesting that what I posted was a better situation than a literal landmass of trash. I fully understand it being broken down and dispersed through the water is way worse. 
It's at like 5kg/km2.  Yeah it sucks and we should be trying to fix it, but that's like 10lbs of waste in the area of 186 football fields.

The micro plastic is a real issue but it isn't world ending if we do something about it.
That could easily be an issue with the Whirlpool Corporation.  It is the first I've heard of it, but I suppose I can see how somebody would use their handling of this issue as reason to avoid their products and subsidiary brands.  I don't know all the details of this case, but it sounds not wonderful.

For my part, I live in the states and try to buy American-made products whenever I can.  I grew up in a town that used to have a dozen different clothing or textile related factories in it--all shuttered up over the past 30-40 years and it is killing the area as a result.  So I buy US-made stuff when I can.  So for me, KitchenAid is one of the great examples of a company making quality, useful stuff in the US, and I'm gonna keep supporting that.  Hopefully my stand mixer doesn't catch fire while I'm mixing cookie dough, though.
It's called corporate and sales tax moron. You want people to invest money into a bottling plant when the profits from that plant are entirely taken from them? Are you retarded?
You've looked up bottling plant on youtube and found an entirely automated robot factory, with robot managers, robot distributors, robot truckers, robot everything.
it's 20 jobs being added with this new capacity.



I'd love to hear your plan on how we are going to get this water to the places in the world that are running out of it.  I hope your plan doesn't involve bottling.....maybe we should run a pipeline!  An Extra Large Pipeline.   Whattya think?
With our hydrogen powered forklifts at the DC you can pick up pallets that at long way but it rips the bottom board off and creates a lot of debris. Only like 3-4 of our vendors do it.
 He actually does that in one of the movies

I'd prefer we didn't allow Nestle to pump any water...but I'm more enraged that they're getting it for next to nothing and making money off our natural resources.
you are a moron for thinking I implied those things are mutually exclusive.

You're incredibly dense. Legislators author, debate and pass *bills* and *resolutions* - They don't become law until the Governor signs the bill or resolution. You might want to educate yourself on how Veto power works, also.

Interpret the law.

Now, yes. In 2002-2008 which is the time frame all of my post have referred to, no.

> Did you not read your linked article? From the first paragraph:

This is why you can't have a legitimate discussion on the issue at hand with anyone any more. Just because I think that the Democrats are at fault for the michigan water crisis **does not** mean any of the following:

* I think Republicans are good
* I am a Republican
* I said anything positive about the republicans 

That being said, it's not John Engler's signature on the permits to divert, or the bill that allows them to do it. Think about it.

Agreed. Tbis just allows deniers to claim it's not their because theirs no pictures of trash island.

Who said I want people to invest money into a bottling plant?  They're tapping a resource which is rival and nonexcludable, and you don't understand what that means.  Moreover, a regional bottling plant does not entail that the water stays within state lines.  You know exactly jack shit about business or economics, so don't front.  Corporate and sales tax...  No shit, idiot.
Because nestle is all about helping people access water.

> Legislators author, debate and pass bills and resolutions - They don't become law until the Governor signs the bill or resolution. You might want to educate yourself on how Veto power works, also.

Do you know how stupid you sound? I said legislators make laws. You agreed!!! Read what you wrote moron. Signing a law is different than MAKING A LAW AND PASSING A LAW!!! Christ you are the dumb Michigan trash I've known most my life. Hows that Macomb Community College degree working out for you? Michigan is the worst state in the union but you wouldn't know that because you never left the state. Guessing you got a pill problem 3 kids. LOL.
I was directed to the Township Hall by the Clerk of Courts (who told me Crawford only voted on even # years), I don't live in the city itself, I believe there are 2 separate townships/voting districts in the county.

So, I remember them not getting enough signatures in 2016, I remember them getting enough by the deadline in 2017 and being on the sample ballot I downloaded. Reading that was in fact the reason I wanted to vote in the first place. Somehow instead of what I read/understood was supposed to happen on Nov. 7, people being able to vote on those 3 Marijuana proposals, what happened was the BMMR was created quietly and without(or with minimal) citizen input or voting.
I no longer have the ballot file (or the same phone). 
Do you have any data to back that up? I would imagine a Texas-sized island of trash would be much more harmful than a miasmic underwater cloud of the same size.
You are fucking retarded. You want to live off the handouts of other people all while wanting to prevent them from making the money you want to live off of.
I hate posting this, because I'm 100% positive that Nestle spends as little as they can to be able to put up this website but:  [you deserve it](https://www.nestle.com/csv/impact/water/access-conservation)



The comment makes perfect sense.
> Do you know how stupid you sound? I said legislators make laws. You agreed!!! Read what you wrote moron.

You're incredibly dense.

Bills are not Laws.

Legislators author, sponsor, introduce, debate and vote on **BILLS**.

Bills are not Laws.

That **BILL** does not become a **LAW** until the **GOVERNOR** or **PRESIDENT** signs it.

Therefore, legislators do not "make laws" - they "make" **BILLS**.

> Signing a law is different than MAKING A LAW AND PASSING A LAW!!!

The Governor or President doesn't sign laws, dipshit. They sign bills. Which then *become law after, and only after their signature*.

> Christ you are the dumb Michigan trash I've known most my life.

You have absolutely no idea how civics work. You are the dumb  trash here. Also, you've been clearly triggered.

I actually have two law degrees from Cooley Law. But you know more about civics and the law than I do. /s

> Michigan is the worst state in the union but you wouldn't know that because you never left the state.

Ah, projection. This is why you're angry. Because *you* have never been able to move out of Michigan, and *you're* the one suffering. I actually live in Pheonix now. I am also double barred in AZ and MI. Sucks to be you.

> Guessing you got a pill problem 3 kids.

Guessing more projection here. Anyways, no kids, a nice salary, a new truck and a nice apartment in a beautiful part of a desert oasis. The things you dream about. No pill problem, but I do smoke lots of weed, something else you probably wish you could afford but cannot.

Exactly what I thought.  You don't know anything about actual economics; you just have some dumb fuck dime-a-dozen opinion and you make facts up to support it.  It's called a *common resource*; read about it and why common resources must be managed (i.e., the tragedy of commons).  These are very basic concepts, econ 101, that you can probably understand if you stop watching stepsister porn all day and pick up a book.
What, propaganda from the source...?


Thanks? 
I didn‚Äôt know CA had water to spare.
> The Forest Service says its permit fees aren‚Äôt based on the volume of water it removes, but rather on the market value of using national forest lands. The agency said the initial fee for the new permit will be about $2,050 per year.

Wow:  $2050 for how many million gallons?  Terrible deal - worst deal ever!  Sad.

>Nestl√© denies causing harm to the environment and has insisted it‚Äôs entitled to keep using the lucrative namesake source of Arrowhead 100% Mountain Spring Water.

I wonder how much improvement we can make using that $2050?

And what are these  improvements?  Boring holes in the mountain to get the water?  Ah yes.

>The company collects water using a system of 10 gravity-fed boreholes and two water tunnels drilled deep into the mountainside. The water flows downhill through a 4.5-mile steel pipeline to a roadside tank, where it‚Äôs pumped into tanker trucks and hauled to a bottling plant.

Remember when we used to associate Nestle with Chocolatey goodness and not some evil Bond villain corporation?
the Forest Service? The Forestservice? Good God Nestle can buy anyone now. Fuck them.
Simple:  boycott bottled water.
There are plenty of personal water containers available.  I prefer Klean Kanteen (stainless steel), but that‚Äôs just me.
Nestle has a really interesting record of over pumping in this area ... Drastically ...

There are some serious drought concerns in CA in general and a bad bark beatle infestation in the San Bernardino mountains specifically.

I am very glad our tax dollars have been hard at work protecting water for Nestle's owners to make fucktons of money from. 
I stopped buying Nestle like a year ago. I recommend you do the same. I mean, unless you'd like them to steal your water next.
We don't NEED bottled water.
Someone is being oiled.
I'm seeing a lot of misinformation in this thread. This is a grant given by the US Forest Service, a federal agency. This is a Trump administration decision. The state has been fighting against it, as described in the article.

I am waiting for the people rom T_D in this thread calling this a terrible move to do a complete 180 once they realize their god emperor is the one responsible.
Remember this people. Its ground water that is bottled and sold, without filtering. It doesn't come from a stream or river. Tap water is cleaner than Nestl√© and Arrowhead water, at least that has minimum standards of cleanliness. 
Just stop buying Nestl√© water. 
   Secretary of Interior Zinke is the guy leading the charge to assure that corporations can continue to rape the land and steal water.
We need Captain Planet to turn some motherfuckers into trees
Yes take public water then sell it back to the public
''All of the water here is poison! My children are no longer with me after one shower, and I have smelled like bacon for 2 years.''
They do the same fucking thing here in Michigan.  Everyone hates the idea but somehow they still get their permit.  Go figure.
Why do we keep ‚Äúgiving‚Äù corporations essentially free natural resources so they can sell it back to us with at a huge profit?
Dirty corrupt turd blossoms, all of them. How is this a thing in a state that is putting water rationing measures in place:https://www.dailywire.com/news/31462/californias-water-law-55-gallons-person-day-paul-bois
So I am fine with the Nestle deal in Michigan (I live here and think we need to charge a quantity fee, but that is something that needs to be fixed with legislation), but CA has major drought issues so this makes no sense.
So let's stop buying Nestle water, right?  And if they continue then we boycott all Nestle products.
What in the actual fuck! Anyone have a list 
 so i know what not to buy?
How the fuck did this happen?!? Is the Forrest service this corrupt? What the ever loving fuck? I can‚Äôt imagine that pumping millions of gallons of water out of the eco system being good for it.
$624.00 per year. Isn't this Corporate Welfare? How much are they making off of this? 
Then all of CA residents should be getting money from Nestle.
Nestle‚Äôs permit situation is a mess. They have the rights to some of the water but some of the ‚Äúpermits‚Äù are shady and it is up to the forest service to approve them and the SWRCB to validate. Nestle seems to know they‚Äôve totally messed up and are willing to comply. Nestle is doing something immoral but it is legal for them to extract the waters within the current system. The real question is how much water they have a right to and if that number is being fudged by officials ? Honestly, the issue needs to tackled via the water code and the reasonable use of bottled water in the state as a whole. 
W.T.F.   This needs investigation.
Nestle tastes so bad why would you ever give them a permit
so, what are they paying per gallon?
Fifty years ago the idea of people buying water in bottles was crazy. Water comes from the tap since the Romans. Here we are and entire states are allowing their water to be divvied up and sold back to them in bottles. We are stupid.
Question. Where else can they get it from? 
How the hell does this terrible shit keep happening? 
Well, that's some fucked up shit.
Can someone explain why are the citizens of CA letting this happen?
I wish I had a sweet job we're I just sat at a desk and companies threw money at me to just be the shitty person I already am. 
Is it even possible to get drinkable water without buying it now?
Leaving Edward Abbey novels at strategic points along trails.
Wonder how big of campaign donation Mr. Trump got for that little bit of California resources?  Damn, I though there was a drought.
As long as they put it plastic bottles, I'm fine with it. Oh, and charge at least $2 per.
Free Market. Nestle pays more for water than all those trees and illegals and tech companies and shit. So Nestle gets the water. 

Also, on /r/politics the thread on this topic will be full of dumbshits blaming Scott Pruitt and Trump and not a single person naming Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. Most of them won't even know who he is. Some "revolution" they'll fight if they don't even know who their enemy is, also, they don't believe in guns, so, lol.

Anyway, it's funny to me. Drill baby drill. Or, pump.baby pump. Whatever.
Neither did California...
They don't, Nestle DOES NOT BELIEVE WATER IS A NECESSITY OR HUMAN RIGHT. The ceo has gone on record multiple times stating he strongly believes water is a "food stuff", and should be privatized for individual gain. These kinds of people need to be extinguished from our earth.
Seriously. 

Why not bottle on the east coast where there is a surplus of water? Bottling in the most draught ridden state seems counter intuitive.  

Logic, apparently absent in corporate America. 
Well it definitely won't soon!
It depends on how much money you have.
>Groundwater is a critical element of the California water supply. During a normal year, 30% of the state's water supply comes from groundwater (underground water). In times of intense drought, groundwater consumption can rise to 60% or more.[4] Over 850,000,000 acre feet (1,050 km3) of water is stored in California's 450 known groundwater reservoirs.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_in_California#Groundwater

there's water. its just in the ground and you got to get it out. 

aquifers are pretty important. 1 cubic megameter of water is a shitload even if half of it isn't cost effective to get to/clean. 
They don't!


Nice pipeline you've got there.  Be a shame if something happened to it.

But you're right. I've spent time in third world countries. Plastic trash is *everywhere* because it's the only clean water they can get 
People seem to not understand that Nestle is just trying to keep up with the demand that people are creating. If you buy bottled water, you are the problem, not the company that's just trying to give you what you want. If you stop, they won't have to do this.
That was before they gave women in the third world free formula for their babies until their milk dried up, then it wasn't free any more.
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
This isn't that surprising; the Forest Service is based around resource extraction, unlike the FWS and NPS.

But generally, it's based around SUSTAINABLE resource extraction.
While thousands of trees are dying from drought no less... Nestl√©'s new slogan should be "Nestl√© - Fuck the Planet".

I've been using a Nalgene because it's made in America. If Klean Kanteens weren't made in China I'd use them.

I've been boycotting bottled water for several years now. I don't think it's made an impact.
And install a Reverse Osmosis filter in your home. There's some cost for installation and maintenance, but once it's up and running it's much cheaper than constantly buying bottled.

I wish I could and I live in a nice area. The water in my area smells disgusting and tastes so nasty :(
>  Its ground water that is bottled and sold, without filtering.

What? No, it is most certainly filtered. 
But do the almost century old pipes that water runs through have the same standards?
Is Arrowhead really that bad? What about Crystal Geyser?
>Tap water is cleaner 

With the EPA we have, I'm not so sure this is true and I think anyone that drinks water from the tap is taking their chances. 
Just stop buying bottled water all together.
Wow it‚Äôs scary that everyone saying something about this is getting downvoted
This is America. Yes, they absolutely are that corrupt, and we will continue to sit here and let them be.
It was protested and appealed but it went federal and got approved.
This is Federal land and the state has no control. 

Many of the western states have a large amount of Federal land that they cannot develop or protect. 
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe people think you can‚Äôt drink tap water .  As a civil engineer, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúpotable water supply,‚Äù for a reason. I can say that all of Vermont tap water meets higher standards for drinking than many bottlers. In some cases, a bottler may locate in a state with lower standards than those states exported to.  In other words, some bottled water is dirtier than tap water. FACT.

It‚Äôs funny until all of the water is gone. 
The US Forest Service is a federal agency. This is a Trump administration decision. The state has been fighting against this. That won't change the anti-California narrative in this thread, though.
Extinguished? With what water?
That's fine, but it's the US Forest Service granting the permit and they're the problem here
Nestle'  is a Swiss National company, and they would prefer to remain neutral in this war.
This is simply not true, and the irony is he said the exact opposite; everyone is entitled to the water they need for basic necessities but no one is entitled to unlimited free water for their swimming pools and golf courses.

They should have the right to live as much as we should have the right to the water that in no way belongs to Nestle.
they do... its in the ground. we have huge aquifers. 
Water is not a human right. Tell that to the two billion people without access to clean water. Anything that costs money and resources to bring directly to you is not and cannot be a right. If you don't like it, then stop buying bottled water and blame the people who do. Nestle is just trying to keep up with the demand. The problem is the people creating the demand.
Why would they leave?  California is giving them the water practically for free and they are getting tax breaks on top of that.  

Fuck the environment, they have money to make.
Why the fuck should they be allowed to bottle public land water in the first place? Regardless of where it is, why the fuck should they get to profit off of it?

This is the one I prefer to bring up. A few selfish statements about water not being free from a CEO is one thing. The formula milk scam was fully realized and is one of the most horrifying acts of a corporation in existence.
That's why the Forest Service is under USDA while NPS is under Interior
Yup, conservation is different from preservation. I remember reading in *A Walk in the Woods* that the Forest Service builds more roads than any other agency.

I tend to err on the side of preservation and I dislike Nestle as much as the next guy, but after reading the article, it doesn't sound like a *terrible* deal from an environmental perspective, since it's only a three-year permit and it will require them to ensure the river maintains minimum flows. Plus, it sounds like research is being done that will be able to lead to a more informed decision when it comes time to consider renewing the permit. It actually sounds like a (small) step in the right direction, although the headline makes it sound like the opposite. The $2,050/year permit is laughable, though.
Jewish God predates the Jews. Tmyk
My friend worked for Klean kanteen and they tried really hard to get anyone to make their bottles in the US and nobody would take it. They honestly didn‚Äôt even care about the cost. Apparently American stainless steel companies don‚Äôt want small products like that and would rather do large work. 
Krusty's Komedy Klassics
What do you think Arrowhead water uses? The first pipes were set up around 1935.

The reason Flint's water situation was so bad, wasn't because the water was polluted, it was the wrong ph level. The water made the sediment, which covered the pipes and lead sealed joints, exposed. Once it was exposed, then it leeched into the water, at a local level. The pipes in the houses were polluting the water. 

The main mistake by the city of Flint, was not neutralizing the ph levels. Had the water been piped into the system at the correct ph level, the water crisis would never have happened. 
They're pretty much all that bad. Penn & Teller did a great episode on bottled water in their Bullshit series. It's one of the biggest and most successful scams of the century.
I don't think one can speak about tap water like it's the same everywhere in the county. In my city I get a report twice a year with all the testing results and it tastes great. That's not true everywhere obviously, but I think it's silly to suggest its always a risk.
Well, I‚Äôve drunk tap water for 52 years and I‚Äôm not dead yet.
Do you think just because Scott Pruitt is in charge of the EPA, that every municipality in the country threw out their filters?
It was just banter.  I can google. Fuck Nestle!
Edit: Apparently Nestle bought reddit. Figures.
But *obviously* all Tap water is not made equal. We all watched Flint, Michigan unfold and *continue to this day with a projected completion date of 2020!!!*

And also, just because regulations exist everywhere in the U.S. doesn't mean that they are upheld everywhere in the U.S. Even many pipes owned by the local governments aren't regularly maintained and upkept *let alone* the pipes in a random apartment building etc.
While I want to downvote you for that SAD meme at the end thanks for the info. I knew about potable water, but with the fact that alot of places don't even let you stockpile rain water coupled with stuff like flint and the probability that bottling plants pollute any water they don't use makes me not trust anything near big businesses.
What can I say?  I'm sure they were all compensated appropriately.  Do you know if Nestle has to pay some kind of fee to Treasury for amounts pumped?
The Foresty Service has been forced to change so much since 1/20/17.

Nestle'?, you mean The Water Company?

but its not free, people still pay for it. besides, dont many areas have laws against collecting rain water? 
It's no use. You're arguing with a bunch of children who grew up with everything being handed to them. They just expect everything to be given to them for free and if they don't get it, they bitch and whine and try to say they're somehow entitled to it.
>**Human right**: a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person.

That might be your opinion, but I believe access to clean water to be a human right. 

Freedom of speech is a human right in the United States. The fact that they don't enjoy that right in North Korea is pretty irrelevant.
The US Forest Service is a federal agency. It's not California's fault. It is Trump's administration.
Thank God California is such a liberal state that cares about the environment!
Because CA cares about its people and wants to use all its power and resources to completely suck us all dry.
Oh. Well I'm an idiot.

It's pretty terrible in the context of California, a drought ridden state with one of the most complex water law deals in the world, to allow nestle to extract water for commercial purposes.

Also, there is constant issues having enough water in the rivers for Salmon.  

This seems really bad, and likely will be challenged via NEPA.

>Tainted tap water isn‚Äôt just a problem in Flint, Michigan. **In any given year from 1982 to 2015, somewhere between 9 million and 45 million Americans got their drinking water from a source that was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act,** according to a new study. Most at risk: people who live in rural, low-income areas.
Smokers use the same rationale.
Errr thinking is hard after lead eh?
Flint, Michigan.
fuck the deep state
Flint is the kid who got the F- in class but there are plenty of D- and F+ cities in the US when it comes to water filtration and quality. And lets not even get into the poor people who live in fracking towns. 
[deleted]
The bit about not collecting rain water is less about a homeowner with a rain barrel, and more about the asshole who builds a 500 acre retaining lake. 

(Also note that most people have no idea that rain water still needs to be filtered, as airborne pollutants can be a serious concern.)
There's plenty mocking CA for "pretending" to protect the environment as if this is something CA is doing rather than something being done to CA.

Also, Reddit generally hates CA.
^ found the guy who falls for internet B.S.
> its not free, people still pay for it

Not always. California, for example, allows many agricultural producers to use as much groundwater as they want for free, leading to the depletion of our shared underwater aquifers for private commercial purposes. 
A right by definition is a principle, not a tangible object. As you said as an example, freedom of speech. The principle is the right. The platform or physical objects and tools you use to exercise that right are not rights. Clean water costs money and resources. Nothing that costs money and resources can be a right because if someone isn't paying for it, it's gone. No one needs to pay anything for you have exercise your freedom of speech. So if everyone decides to stop paying their taxes, stop paying for water, and the workers running it stop showing up, you expect it to just continue by the grace of god because it's a human right? That's not how it works. If you want clean water delivered to your house on demand, you need to pay for it. Otherwise, you're free to go get your own water and purify it yourself. Access to water could be a right. Clean purified water delivered to your house, absolutely not.   

I don't even understand your problem here. You want water. They take the water from a place far away from you that you will never go to, never see, and never access, clean it, bottle it, and bring it to you. Isn't that what you want? You just expect them to do it for free because you think it's your right?
Trump's fault?

"Nestl√© acquired the operation in 1992, and has been paying $624 per year to the Forest Service for the permit."
The US Forest Service is a federal agency. This wasn't a California decision. I don't expect Reddit to get that in the way of their CA hate boner though.
Daily reminder that liberals and conservatives are playing for the same team - the bourgeoisie. Sure, liberals and conservatives differ on some policies, but they are ultimately just different arms of the same beast - the beast of capital. A vote for any of the two is a vote for the beast. Only when workers realize that they have lost the class war and rise up and seize the means of production will things ever get better. You have nothing to lose but your chains, comrades. 
The US Forest Service is a federal agency under Trump's control. Nice try.
Ooo fuck

Please tell me what you took from that article. Cause I don't think that study covers what you are claiming 


Edit: down votes don't change what is in that study. You would know that if you read the link
??? No Fuck it
None of that detracts from what I was saying, though. It's still a reduction in what they were previously allowed to take, with mandatory minimum flows, and a requirement that they stop draining the water at times to study the effects of taking the water. I'd prefer the water to not be bottled, but since it is being bottled, this is the way it should be done. In a way that requires Nestle to reduce the environmental impact while research is done in order to make an informed decision in the future.
Nestle bottles water primarily for human consumption. There is an upper limit to how much water a person can drink.

Agriculture uses around 85-90% of all fresh water in California. The amount of water used for human consumption is vanishingly small compared to agriculture. 
Yeah it‚Äôs a great company. They‚Äôll keep trying to find a US company to make their products and I‚Äôm sure someday will.

I smoke AND drink tap water, and I‚Äôm texting this while driving. In the Indy 500.
Bottled water drinkers use the same rationale.
Agreed. Also, I was reading something not long about how railroad companies used to sell the land beneath their railroad for burying industrial waste and there is still tens of thousands of TONS of it buried near and under railroads in the US. (Turns out you do need the EPA when companies just don't give a fuck.) So all it takes is one little leaky pipe in the neighborhood of this waste to totally contaminate that part of the water supply.
Unfortunately the details are a bit more complicated than that news station wants to present:

As stated in the article, the EPA lead limit testing rule *insanely* requires that only 90% of the tests of a given area's waters pass. This is briefly mentioned but not directly explained in the article that you linked. That means that graphs like this (round 5 tests in blue) ["indicate"](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2017-01/flint_update.jpg) that everything is within EPA's acceptable standards. But look how 17 houses still have test results above 15 ppb. Sucks to live in one of those houses I guess, or the unknown number of other houses that still have high lead.

In another article about the same data you're referencing, the residents are still recommended to do the [following](https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/09/latest_virginia_tech_testing_s.html): "Although city water meets the requirements of federal Lead and Copper Rule, officials have suggested residents continue to use faucet filters or bottled water to protect themselves from lead that can break free from transmission pipes while a significant amount of underground construction is occurring in Flint." Construction isn't supposed to be finished until 2020.

And in April of this year, elevated lead levels were found in a number of samples from [Flint public schools](https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/04/lead_elevated_in_4_percent_of.html) with 3 samples more than 100 ppb, **6 times** the upper EPA limit. So don't attend one of those public schools, I guess.

There are still more than 14 *thousands* active lead service lines in Flint.

So while yes, their water might meet an arbitrary standard, calling it safe to drink isn't necessarily accurate.
Let me start with your weird definition of a right. I assume you're one of those libertarians who tries to spread their ideology by trying to force everyone else to work under their very myopic definition of a human right? You're referring to "inalienable rights" and even then that definition is up for interpretation.

Freedom of speech and access to clean water are both human rights that can be protected by the government. The government has to actively protect rights all the time. I don't really understand your issue with my supporting the government adopting a policy that access to clean water is a human right.

As far as my problem with this deal with Nestle, it is taking public water and giving it to a private corporation to profit from. I don't think I really need to explain the issue I have with this further.
[deleted]
This person is a Russian troll
Except conservatives aren't going around saying how the environment is precious and we need to do everything possible to stop climate change and what not. Liberals like the ones in California frequently let us know how we are killing the environment and the need to impose water conservation measures to the citizens of the state, yet companies like Nestle and Farmers throughout are the most responsible for the water consumption. Stop telling me about the environment and climate change until you get your shit in order. Until then STFU.
I was unaware that it was a federal agency making the decision (if true). However you blaming Trump for this is stupid as Nestle has been doing the same thing for decades under both rep and dem administrations.

You need to learn express yourself, you not only come off as an ass but you aren't being clear.

Also, I'm linking some sources, so unless you got something to back it up, "universally accepted" isn't really an explanation.

Here are a list of human rights recognized by the United Nations. You can see water is not on there nor is any other commodity that can be bought and sold. http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/human-rights/  

No one is taking public water and giving it to anyone. Nestle is taking it by a permit granted to them at the cost of millions of dollars. They are paying you for that water. You are profiting off of it. That's also the whole purpose of the Forest Service. The Forest Service and National Forests don't exist for the purpose of preservation. They exist to manage resources; resources that are intended to be extracted and used. People need that water. That's why it's being extracted. The government could take it or a private company can pay the government to take it. The latter is much more efficient and saves everyone a lot of money. 
You were SO close.
This is on federal land, and the forest service is a federal agency.  California being liberal has nothing to do with it.
Someone didn't read the article.
I'm not upset that Nestle exists... I'm upset that the US Forest Service under Trump gave them this grant... How can you not understand this simple concept?
Yeah my source is that same fucking article.

So gonna slow it down. Do you think that article covers a study of the world oceans?

Oh so its name calling time eh? You, Sloppy faced, big eared, rancid breath, republican.

That's not the Indy 500, its the sidewalk. And you can be damned sure he's driving backwards. Of course he's also driving a Datsun, and its a can of Schlitz, so I'm not sure anything this guy says is true. 
Hang in there, I‚Äôll toss you one of these beers!
>Here are a list of human rights recognized by the United Nations. You can see water is not on there nor is any other commodity that can be bought and sold. http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/human-rights/

Here are the "Economic, social, and cultural rights"

* the right to work in just and favourable conditions;
* the right to social protection, **to an adequate standard of living** and to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental well-being;
* **the right to education** and the enjoyment of benefits of cultural freedom and scientific progress.

I'm sure you're aware that education is a commodity that can be bought and sold. That's why I'm still paying student loans. Regardless, how can you be expected to have an "adequate standard of living" if you don't have access to clean water? Your warped view of the definition of a human right is nothing more than a way to try to justify your inhumane ideology.


Anyway, I don't really feel like arguing with you whether or not Trump's administration is making a good decision in granting Nestle this right. I won't change your mind. I will just point out that Nestle does not work in the best interests of the people. Getting water for cents and selling it for dollars is not in the best interest of the people. It is in the best interest of Nestle who has a long history of screwing over the common man.

Yeah, I'm Canadian you unabashed troll. Have fun being lonely on the internet.
To win an argument you can either disprove your opponent or prove your own point. You did neither.

Jumping to insults means you have no evidence that you're right and just want to silence anyone that disagrees with you. It's an approach typically favoured by those who aren't intelligent to fully understand a subject and act defensively to end the conversation before others realise that. Even in if you use it in an argument where you're right one day people will think you're stupid. 
I didn‚Äôt ask if you were white I asked if you had ever been to the south. The majority of black people in the United States live in the American south. And the south is nothing like how it is portrayed in movies, tv, etc 
Southerners treat minorities with more kindness than northerners. Races are more integrated in the south vs the north.

An education doesn't mean attending a university at the cost of thousands of dollars. It means access to information to educate yourself. If you're literate and have access to information, you're educated. Why do you have student loans then when it's a human right? Why do you pay for water if it's a human right? Because they're not. Also, your definition of adequate standard of living seems to be significantly higher than reasonable. Are you supposed to be provided a house and food for free along with your water? Primitive tribes can live off the land with nothing that you would consider adequate standards and they're perfectly happy and just fine. Most likely even better off than you are. And now you have to bring Trump into this? The last resort of a moron. Well hrrrr drrr Trump bad, mmkay. He has nothing to do with it. Nestle sells a product that people want and buy. If you don't like it, then don't fucking buy it and take it up with the people who do. It's not the government's job to hold your hand, wipe your ass, and make sure nothing offends you. These are free adults in a free society participating in a free market. The end consumer controls what happens. They are the problem. Not the government, not the forest service, not the private company. It's you and everyone else around you. If people want bottled water, it has to come from somewhere and if it's not here, it's just somewhere else.

Fucking morons

> An education doesn't mean attending a university at the cost of thousands of dollars. It means access to information to educate yourself.

Access to clean water doesn't mean getting triple distilled cucumber water delivered to you every five minutes. It means access to clean water to take and consume yourself.


Nah, he means you're a total cunt. Who cares what you have to say?

And I agree
You type like how I used to type, exactly how I talk, but I stopped because even though I'm considered a "dick", the way I say things, facial expressions, and body language help soften the blunt way I talk and people laugh. That shit doesn't translate online and I ended up looking like you do now, just an unlikable asshole. Switch your shit up, just a tip.
it's really funny reading how proud you are of yourself


Way worse? You‚Äôre just making shit up. Slavery ended more than a hundred and fifty years ago. Do you think anyone alive in the south today bears any responsibility for that? Also if it is so racist today why do so many black people choose to stay there? 
Also I‚Äôd argue the south as a whole is much more racially integrated than the majority of yankee cities. During the civil rights era the south was forced to desegregate while northern cities were not. I personally have never been to a city more segregated than Chicago for example.

I see a lot of Americans commenting but as a Europeen who lived in the US for my studies, I can assure you that americans dont consume a lot of water bottles ! 
Every fucking one has an insulated water bottle or something of the like. I bought a bunch of Hydro Flasks when I came home to Europe last year and I swear to God, it's nearly impossible to find water fountains in France or Switzerland! Everyone buys bottled water from the big cancerous companies like Evian, Volvic and other big europeen brand.
They've been doing this all over the country for decades. I remember the same story happening in our local aquifer in the early 90s. The amount of water they expected to draw would have ruined many people's wells.

This is the kind of corporate crap why we need federal government to protect all Americans from corporate greed!
Nestle just bought the small local spring water company in our town.  Prices raised from 7.90/5gal to 11.99/5gal plus a $7 delivery charge.  

Our tap water source comes from a reservoir that had a mercury mine so we cannot take the chance of drinking it but now cannot afford this.   Plus it has a crap ton of chlorine in it.  

They have bought water sources all over the world (they own Pellegrino now too) and are gouging people.   They are a horrible company.  Look them up.  Do not buy their products!
1. Make a list of every business Nestle owns. Every single one.

2. Make a list of a small or local business that can replace the need fulfilled by the Nestle business.

3. Repeat with every corporation or business known to commit atrocities. 

4. Never look back. Bleed them dry.
"Water? You mean like in the toilet? What for?"
Help me understand this a little better. If they don‚Äôt capture that spring water where does it go?  Aside from bottled water being a ridiculous industry, why is it bad?  For who?  Would it eventually end up mixing with salt water and become undrinkable anyway?
Are we also mad at Coca-Cola for all the water they put into their products?  And all those cans and bottles they make us purchase?
For reference, California uses 3.3 billion gallons per day.
Water homies, we must destroy this company.
In Michigan, we got lots of signatures, tried really hard to fight Nestle. Wrote letters, attended town halls. Guess what impact that had? Nothing. The voicing of the concerns of the public, we the people, are a mere paperwork formality.

"water being a basic human right is a pretty extreme idea"

~ the CEO of nestle
I need to make sure I stopped buying Nestl√© shit.
Maybe people should stop buying water from the a**holes..
That‚Äôs just one location, they are doing that at every well they have access to.
The real sad thing is, many, many people don't give a shit unless the water is being sucked out of their own backyards. If they can't see it, or it isn't happening to them, it might as well not exist.
\#sorrynotsorry Nestle shouldn't exist.  I understand when people who live in places like Flint Michigan need bottled water but I am so sick of every well off person being too good for tap water that is 100% safe or these nuts that complain about the chlorine or fluoride in water poisoning/brainwashing us.
Nestl√© don't produce bottled water, they produce plastic bottles.

appreciate the responses
TIL: If you drink bottled water, you're worse than Hitler.
They've been doing this for decades. In Northern California they have been getting away with taking the states fresh water!!!
As a lifelong High Springs, FL resident and past Ginnie Springs employee I think its worth noting if it hadn't been yet that that Ginnie Springs and the Wrays that own it have been selling massive amounts of water for profit for ages.  The major issue here at least publicly I think is the fact that the ownership at Ginnie is about to lose a ton of money.  The amount of water bottled may be going up but this has been going on for years and years.
You mean a corporation is hurting people for Wall Street greed and we are going to whine and do nothing about it?!
Just came here to say, like many others, fuck nestle
Apparently not enough for these FUCKS to take water from the Great Lakes, which by the way, only benefit the specific counties bordering those facilities. Fuck Nestle, what a horrible, horrible company. Honestly, I would love for a Libertarian to explain this.
They also own Arrowhead
I know they're big and own lots of other companies, but people should *at least* stop buying products that say Nestl√© anywhere on the package.

Edit: [Here are some of their brands](https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nestle-subsidiaries.jpg) they also have deep ties to Starbucks, selling Starbucks branded products and running Starbucks locations outside the US.
Been boycotting these scum fucks for years since they said clean water is not a human right. Fuck these parasites. All they do is take take take
We vote more with our money than our words. I stopped buying their products when I first heard they bought lakes in Cali.
ITT and every thread about Nestle: people having no context for how much water is actually a lot of water. Nestle sucks for plenty of reasons. This really isn‚Äôt one of them.
I wonder why articles about bottled water never give us what percentage of the water discharged per day the companies are asking to capture? 
I looked it up and Ginnie springs flows about 38 to 40M gallons a day so the permit is asking for a max of 1.1 but guessing most days would be significantly less
Not saying right or wrong just wondering why articles never give the data to allow people to make educated decision 
1.1m sounds like a massive number......but 2% of the daily volume doesn‚Äôt sound as dramatic
I guess it‚Äôs drama equals clicks and facts are boring
I for one can‚Äôt resist that chocolate water goodness.
>‚ÄúIt would make no sense to invest millions of dollars into local operations just to deplete the natural resources on which our business relies.

Sure it would.  If you've done the math and determined losing the millions you invested were a drop in the bucket compared to what you would make from the investment, it makes perfect sense.  I mean, it's still a shitty thing to do to the environment, but it makes perfect sense for a money hungry mega corporation.
Forget thinking of Nestle as some evil avatar.


Who are the employees that are making the proposal, the project manager in charge, the executives spearheading the project, and every other rung in the ladder that is well perked and salaried pushing this shit.
I knew this was the Ginnie Springs shit before I even clicked it. 

Guess I better dive here before we lose it.
Nestle is just awful, they need some restrictions already. I feel like I read a new awful headline to do with them every month or so.
If you want to stop this, follow the link below and make a comment in the permitting system. Every comment is looked at by staff at the Suwannee River Water Management District.

There are few impositions more evil and insidious than the concerted effort to extract, monopolize, and sell fresh water, perhaps the most basic human need and right, back to those it has been stolen from. So they can go ahead and try. The people will fight it the whole way. And the people will fail, because that is the America we live in. Nestle will get their water as they always do. But we all know the day is coming when all the resources reach critical lows, when this issue is no longer about future sustainability but about present survival. And on that day Nestle will have to answer not to civil opposition but to angry, thirsty mobs pushed past the limits of their patience and on the cusp of losing the ability to keep their families alive and healthy. Nestle will receive as much mercy as they've given. I hope people storm the factories and the gated homes of the corporate show runners, and take back what's rightfully theirs. And I hope that all who have been complicit in the effort to suck the resources dry for no better reason than profit and control will answer *violently* for what they've done. It's inevitable at this point, and will be our only redemption. I can only hope there's a world after that.
This dude is strait up baron harkonen
This sadly has been a issue for a long time. There was a spring well put in by some bottling company 5ish years ago and our local streams and creeks water levels have dropped significantly. Of course the bottler will never admit to this but it's surprisingly convenient how quickly the water table went back up when the well was down for nearly 4 months after flood damage and a week after the brought it back online waters dropped. When residents spoke out in protest our wonderful township reps held a closed door meeting with only them and the bottler. 

Sad for the amount of profit they make off of these things. I think the well here costs them like 10 cents per 100 gallons. Imagine the profits they are making off 1.1 million gallons a day.
This is why our world is going to shit, and this is why we can't have nice things!
They have done some terrible things, especially with water, they move into communities that rely on well water for drinking and irrigation, extract so much water from the ground and natural sources that communities are forced to buy bottled water. 

If you dig into some of the stuff Nestle does, you'd start to discover what a horrible company they are.
Jesus Christ, when the hell are we going to stand up and burn these fucking companies to the ground.
r/hydrohomies ASSEMBLE!
as long as boomers keep buying bottled water this will happen
It should be illegal to take water out of a watershed no matter how it‚Äôs done.
Gotta say I'm never buying anything from Nestle ever again. I'll have to find out all the companies they own because I'm sure there are plenty.

They want to own the water
Great. What will the outcry do? Absolutely nothing.
yeah so... no news here and nothing will happen. like literally. set a reminder from 6 month from now. by that time they probably doubled the volume.
Buy a Berkey (or similar) water filtration system. $250-300. It sits nicely on your counter. Fill it with tap water. Get a reusable water bottle and use it instead. There‚Äôs no need to buy bottled water from shit corporations like Nestle.
I think anyone familiar with this company is not surprised in the least. Boycott, people!!!
Between this shit and the plastic bottle, we just need to stop buying bottled water in general.
What a mess. We are going to have serious shortages of freshwater in the very near future and we cannot allow big Ag and corporations to continue taking massive amounts of the water rights!! The plastic bottles alone should not be allowed! There is no fucking reason to need bottled water!!!
You're not paying for the water, you're paying for the convenience.
Nestle has a deal with Michigan. They take 130 million gallons of water each year for $200. They also have one with California for similar amount.
Bottled water is an abomination. I drink tap water and have not died. I carry a reusable water bottle. We are so. Damn. Greedy. To have made bottled water to sell!
I made a post semi-related to this on r/AskReddit and it didn't even get posted. Basically Nestle has been taking water from lakes across Canada and in some casing using expired permits and are getting the water for free, to sell to sell to us for $3+.
Yeah fuck Nestle, hope they go bankrupt.
Easy solution, since corporations always follow the profit, is to quit buying water bottles. Use tap water, or if your local city/well water sucks run it through an in-home treatment unit! Probably cheaper in the long run anyway!
Man greed is dangerous stuff
Florida really has to reconsider the people that they put into political office. In the meantime good luck.
Yeh just dont buy Nestle anymore.
Another reason to boycott Nestle.

I hope Nestle dies. Dies horribly. Absolutely fucking pathetic.
Stop buying bottled water, then
Bottled water is mostly a BS money grabbing industry that shouldnt exist. 

However, we do need bottled water for emergency situations, relief efforts, and things of that nature. Additionally some communities only have disgusting well water, and I believe some medical conditions require distilled water. 

If you do not fall under one of the above cases, you should not be buying bottled water. It's laziness, just buy a reusable bottle and refill with tap water. Itll help the environment, and will take money out of jerk companies like Nestle's pocket.
Screw Flint, Michigan though, right? GROSS.
I first boycotted Nestle and all of their products when they first started pushing breast-feeding mothers in Africa to switch to baby formula. UNICEF estimated that a formula-fed child living in disease-ridden and unhygienic conditions are between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. The mothers that switched, used polluted water to make the formula. There were directions on mixing the formula but were still unable to read the language in which sterilization directions were written.

If they take 1.1m million gallons  = at least 4.4 million plastic bottles per DAY!

An easier way is to just not buy processed food
Yup, I use a shaker cup and a Brita filter.  We've lived in our place for 5 years now and never once bought a case of water

We live in an arid, "High Desert" region. But the water bottling companies still are sucking up local water supplies. TBF, we're very rural and the local townships are so disorganized that they won't even share water with each other, much less risk losing a major employer here. Every person in the county knows the bottling plant is the absolute worst place to work. Fuck Nestle and all the greedy water moguls.
I like high in the Rockies, surrounded by snowmelt rivers and streams. The water can't get any fresher and I still see idiot tourists buy box upon box of bottled water.

80,000 people were against it. $200 permit for 400 gallons/min. The outcry was heard. Still got approved with only 75, yes only 75 supporting nestle.
And here I am, drinking out of the tape and hose pipe still. Enjoying my extra dose of teeth protection. And I already pay a monthly bill for water, might as well get my moneys worth.
I bought water for my hurricane supplies, but that‚Äôs all.
Lol I was working this weekend at a house. They offered me water, at first a glass of tap which tasted funny but I really don't care. Then they just brought out a case of arrowhead water from the fridge. Arrowhead does not taste right lol.
Are there any stats on how much clean water is getting bottled up around the world?  These numbers alone are astounding to me.
In Arizona the tap water tastes absolutely horrendous. But most people will buy a water cooler and water from local water and ice shops.
I refuse to buy them. I have a cabinet full of reusable water bottles for the family. I think I've bought one in the past two years and it was a literal "buy it or probably get sick from dehydration" type of situation. It killed me to do it. I saved the bottle and reused it until the cap broke.
I use due to traveling all over the midwest.  At home I never do.
We generally drink tap water. Given that, the water company flushes their pipes with chlorine during rain season (sometimes very high levels). my wife is pregnant so we are doing purified water until we get a convenient filter set up.

Given that, Florida tap water does not taste especially good due to the regular minerals in it. its not unsafe, it just does not taste great. The bottled water that we are drinking lately tastes way better.
While I generally don't drink bottled water, I do have a  few cases of gallon jugs in my house sitting in the closet for just in case the water craps out again. My county has a terrible water infrastructure a pipe break is not uncommon where there is a water advisory to boil the water or just straight not drink it.
I'm from the U.S, but I'm visiting family in Bangladesh, a much poorer country. Here, I rely on bottled water since I'd get sick from the tap water here due to the bacteria. Yet, my parents drink bottled water back in New York City, even though the tap water there is very good.
My mom refuses to drink tap water cause of chemicals or diseases or something so I'm just kinda stuck with bottles I guess
I worked in public works for a city in Texas. If you saw the inside of some of those water pipes and the water that's in it, you wouldn't even take a shower in it. Just because it is sterilized with tons of bleach and flouride doesn't means it's the best thing to drink. I guess it just depends on the water system.
If you're like me and get it for convenience or on the go, reuse it. Seriously, don't just toss it right away.
My tap water tastes disgusting no matter how much I filter it. Just because it's safe doesn't mean it's pleasurable. I do feel like garbage for wasting so many bottles though.
The tap water in my apartment tastes of plastic. I seriously doubt that that shit is safe.
fuck this shit. My tap water is safe, but **taste like shit**, even with a britta. My apologies for wanting to have a quick water on the go that actually tastes good.
I help my dad in landscaping and we bring plastic water bottles. We have no means of getting water unless clients allow us in there houses. Sometimes bottled water is much easier and more convenient
People often fail to put it into perspective. Tap and bottled costs vary widely as does water usage, but consider this.

If you used bottled water instead of tap for your household needs (shower, toilet, washing machine) you **daily** cost would be a several hundred dollars almost anywhere in the US.

Get up to Zephyr Hills then; they've been pumping for years.
Use that meth strength to destroy it
Oregonians fought Nestle for 12 years and we managed to block them pumping water out of the Columbia River Gorge.

It was the dumbest battle ever because they were only offering a few jobs not event guaranteed to be full time or not get automated. Also, Oregon had statewide voted against the sale so they could only get the water through a backroom water swap. After ten years, they nearly got their way and plonked a factory in the middle of a natural area that most Oregonians feel very strongly about. Currently, the deal is dead do to steadfast opposition.

It's possible to drive them off. Make sure politicians know people care about this. It was harder ten years ago when climate change was something people saw as far off. Hopefully the area is preserved, but look how badly selling water rights went for places like California. You need to be future thinking. Florida may need that water supply to be a public resource.
Your country salutes you Florida Man.
I grew up close to Lakeland and Crystal Springs was one of my favorite places to go swim. When I see someone with a bottle of Zephyrhills, I go out out of my way to tell them I peed in that water as a kid.

I live in the northeastern part of Iowa, and our tap water tastes like straight-up chlorinated swimming pool water most days, with a hint of metallic taste. It's disgusting.

And then I move over to Ames, IA for university, and the tap water tastes like I'm drinking snow melt-off from a mountain in Colorado. Delicious. No hint of chlorine or additives. Just pure, clean water.

I'm willing to bet that the people calling us stupid for buying bottled water have never had "bad" tap water in their lives.
During the industrial revolution a lot of larger companies were not disposing of chemicals and waste products that effect our groundwater.

I live in area that has high levels of chemicals left behind by IBM decades ago... after having my tap water tested professionally I was told by 2 different companies that it would be unsafe for drinking without heavy filtration systems being installed .. can‚Äôt get away with something like a filter on the faucet
Depends on region. For example, the water in northern NJ tastes pretty great, the water in central Iowa tastes like garbage
Depends on where you live.  The town in CT where I live and the town where I work both have fabulous water. And other than coffee in the morning, it's all I drink
America is a big county. my tap water is great, but some places i will not drink tap water
Water tastes good in Atlanta, tastes like garbage in Indianapolis. Depends on where you are.
In most places it is fine, just lazy people.
It's fantastic where I live yet there are still plenty of people that won't drink it.
personally i find a lot of people are really particular about tap water and refuse to drink it. then i try water from their tap and it tastes absolutely fine to me, so i have no idea why they are constantly buying bottles/jugs of water.

it's stupid. i've lived up and down the East Coast of the US my whole life and I have ALWAYS drank the tap water. it's fine in CT, it's fine in MA, it's fine in NC.
California sold those water rights to Nestle.   If you want them back, petition the State government to for buy them back.  If you want the government to seize that lawfully bought property, it's illegal and you will pay out of the wazzo once it gets anywhere other then a partisan district.
Good lord. They own the whole world.
Depends on where you were in the US. The culture varies significantly across all 50 states. Where I live, I bring my own personal water cup to and from work. I don't see others doing it.
Really? I visited Switzerland for the first time this year (from US) and I was astounded by how many fountains of fresh water there were all over the cities that I was able to fill my bottle from
Why would you need water fountains? Just drink tap water. In many places in Europe, including Switzerland, tap water is of higher quality  than bottled water.
I‚Äôve seen public drinking fountains in just about every Swiss town I‚Äôve visited. My small village has at least 5 I can think of off the top of my head. Hell, even the town of Evian has a free fountain provided by Evian itself.
Anecdotal evidence but it seems to me that middle/upper class people buy a $10+ reusable bottle while lower class buy the $3 24 packs of disposable bottles

This will be what I call a "boycott of convenience".

You'll brag about it on facebook, but the second your thirsty and the only option is some nestle water from a vending machine, you'll be drinking.
Go away, batin!
I've yet to find any proper criticisms more than "Nestle are bad and this is bad" Looking at the flow rate of this river it has 1.1m gallons flowing through it every 2 to 4 minutes, so extracting that much per day seems like a pretty insignificant amount
Yeah, Nestle is terrible company with a lot terrible things in its closet, but TONS of companies use fucktons of water.  Bottled water is just another drop in the bucket.  They just get flak because they're selling it directly without modification.

Like, textiles uses a crapload of water, even if you ignore the water cost of growing the cotton/other material.  Like a single pair of jeans is anywhere between 500-3000 gallons of water.
What are you implying, that we could be mad at craft beer? Or realize that a pound a beef takes ~ 1,000 gallons of water, so this is basically a cow/day?

Don't be ridiculous. There's a clear line here, Nestle bad, please get with it.
I'm starting to see the wisdom in stopping my soda consumption as well.  There are SO many companies that are making a fortune by essentially selling us water in containers.
This selective outrage makes no sense. If you sell a bottle of liquid that is 100% water, mega outrage. Sell a bottle that's 99% water 1% sugar.... Crickets.

Either bottled beverages are okay or they are not. Whatever harm you are worried about with bottled water is not undone by adding sugar to the bottle. If plastic bottle waste is a problem then tax plastic bottles and people will adapt accordingly.
I see r
This reference is more misleading than anything. California is a state of 40 Million people, this is a private company's plan to take water from a single river. Even the fact that this is 1/3000th of a state's entire water consumption is astonishing. 

A closer comparison would be to say that nestle plans to take 2 olympic swimming pools of water a day from this florida river
As another reference, Ginnie Springs, the spring in question, has a daily outflow of almost 40 million gallons. Taking 1.1 million gallons is nothing
California is an agricultural state. Not a water bottling company.
You are aware Michigan has more water than they know what to do with right?
Because you were wrong. Its Michigan which literally means large lake. Those mechanisms are for other water rights holders to argue that their use will be impacted by the new extraction or that it will cause environmental issues.

And because its Michigan there is going to be enough water for use by the environment and all other users.
Opponents say the fragile river, which is already officially deemed to be ‚Äúin recovery‚Äù by the Suwannee River water management district after years of earlier overpumping, cannot sustain such a large draw ‚Äì a claim Nestl√© vehemently denies. Critics are fighting to stop the project as environmentally harmful and against the public interest.

Meanwhile, Nestl√©, which produces its popular Zephyrhills and Pure Life brands with water extracted from similar natural springs in Florida, has spent millions of dollars this year buying and upgrading a water bottling plant at nearby High Springs in expectation of permission being granted.

The company needs the Suwannee River water management district to renew an expired water use permit held by a local company, Seven Springs, from which it plans to buy the water at undisclosed cost. Nestl√© insists spring water is a rapidly renewable resource and promises a ‚Äúrobust‚Äù management plan in partnership with its local agents for long-term sustainability of its water sources.

Yet company officials concede in letters to water managers supporting the permit request that its plans would result in four times more water being taken daily than Seven Springs‚Äô previously recorded high of 0.26m gallons for its customers before Nestl√©.
Nestle wants to take 1.152 million gal per day or 421 million gal per year. The water flow rate at that part of the river is ~120 billlion gal per year. They want .36% of the water flow. 

If human water extraction is causing a problem its agriculture not bottled water.
In this case the facility and even an existing water use permit are already in place and have been approved by the county, city, and water management district.
As someone else said, there has been a bottling plant here for decades that was just sold to Nestle. Nestle is taking nearly the same amount of water that the old owners were taking, so nothing is changing essentially. The water management district here does the permitting. They also permit farms to withdraw millions and millions per day, much of which becomes runoff or evaporated and also these agricultural water permits are not heavily regulated. 

I live 15 minutes from this area and we have a lot of problems bigger than Nestle in regards to our water. I hate Nestle too but it‚Äôs outrageous that the old company did the exact same thing and no one cared for decades.
Full quote for reference:

> ‚ÄúWater is, of course, the most important raw material we have today in the world. It‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter.¬†The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.¬†Personally, I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff a value so that we‚Äôre all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there.‚Äù
"The water you need for survival is a human right, and must be made available to everyone, wherever they are, even if they cannot afford to pay for it. However I do also believe that water has a value. People using the water piped into their home to irrigate their lawn, or wash their car, should bear the cost of the infrastructure needed to supply it." - Nestle CEO
Ive never seen Nestle corp and Hitler in the same room
Really, is nestle even the only company that sells bottled spring water?
If you buy a bottle of pop or water from a different company then you are also taking water from a bottling plant, just a different brand.  How is that better?
Nestl√© yearly uses about 120 million gallons of water a year. Sounds like a a lot - until you realize that the city of LA uses that in 24 hours. There are good reasons to boycott Nestl√© - but to say they are 'using all our water!' is slightly misleading
Yeah.  Pretty much every industry consumes a metric fuckton of water.  Bottling is a drop in the bucket.

[Nestle brands](https://www.nestle.com/aboutus/overview/ourbrands)
They didn't intentionally kill all those babies.
Proof that if you position an expletive near the word nestle, your comment doesn't have to make any sense or even have any grammatical structure for it to be upvoted.
That is insane.
I hope everyone adopts this attitude.  In the seventies no one bought water and we all LIVED!
It's almost like it's a global monopoly that needs to be split up.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
If you're committed to not eating shit that makes you fat, you've probably inadvertently not been buying Nestle products for a while now.
Boycotting is not enough. Bottling plants should be raided and destroyed.
it's sad to see people boycott nestle's main brands, but then end up getting back at them by buying some other premium brand, without knowing nestle owns them too.
So "L'Oreal" is from Nestle, and "The Body Shop" is from "L'Oreal". But the image of the body shop is this fair-trade, environmetally friendly thing.

I am confused.
The reason "water is a human right" was used is because nestle's ceo is on record for saying people don't have the right to water.
If we keep going like we are, it'll be a natural paradise because we'll be extinct.
> it's the "unregulated" part of "unregulated capitalism" that i have a problem with.

No free market advocate or economist with half a brain wouldn't agree with you.

"Free markets" and "capitalism" cannot exist without regulation.  Anyone who advocates unregulated capitalism might as well argue for inevitable oligarchy and monopolies.
The US is one of the biggest opponents of international recognition of water and sanitation as a human right.
They own over 2000 so yeah definitely not complete
I mean a case or two for emergency supplies can never be to bad a thing. Never know. Besides that with you 100%.
We buy a couple cases for hurricane prep. That's it.
You might not even need the Brita filter
Here in the States, what does happen to plastics that we dispose of in the mandatory recycling bin?
>two litter bottles

Your autocorrect knows what's up.
Why can't they build their bottling plants in places where water is almost an infinite resource instead?
Olancha, CA?
To be fair, is it advertised as safer or better to drink? How would they know if they come from a place where tap water sucks?
I wait waiting for someone to link a Michigan article. This was such bullshit. Apparently  if they changed the law to treat Nestle fairly the farmers who pump water for their fields would get screwed.
Saved this from another post on Nestle. Just some perspective...

‚Ä¢ There is a total of ~20,000,000 gallons of water per minute (GPM), permitted to be extracted within the State of Michigan. Nestle will be increasing their extraction in one well from 250 GPM to 400 GPM, bringing their statewide extraction rate to about 2,175 GPM.

 ‚Ä¢ Nestle is approximately the 450th largest user of water in the state, slightly behind Coca-Cola.

 ‚Ä¢ Nestle won't pay for the water, because water is, by statute, not a commodity to be bought and sold within the State of Michigan, or any of the states and provinces within the Great Lakes Compact. Since it is not a commodity, it is a resource. This protects us from California or Arizona from building massive pipelines to buy our water as our natural resource laws prevent this. Residents also don't pay for water, rather we pay for treatment, infrastructure, and delivery of water, but the water itself is without cost.

 ‚Ä¢ The state denies lots of permit requests, but this request showed sufficient evidence that it would not harm the state's natural resources, so state law required it to be approved. The state law which requires this to be approved can be changed, but due to the resource vs. commodity thing that's probably not something we want.

It was approved because the laws and regulations require it to be approved if the states wants to continue treating water as a natural resource and not a commodity.
Ah, the benefits of flouride!

Have you ever read up on the problems with that stuff? Seriously though, some tap water is far better than bottled.
wow thanks. i had no idea about the beauty products. sad :( there should be an app.... nestle or not? blech
>H√§agen-Dazs

FUCK. I had to look this up. There's literally no other grocery store ice cream I'll buy besides MAYBE Talenti because every other brand in the store is whipped full of air and sold by volume rather than weight and then they add Guar gum and carob bean gum and locust bean gum and carrageenan and lots of -ates and -ites and tons of other shit that just doesn't need to be in quality ice cream. And ice cream is my one treat I eat. I don't really eat chips or candy or pretzels, I have ice cream after dinner. 

Turns out that H√§agen-Dazs owned by 50% nestle, 50% Ice Cream Partners USA, and Nestle has a 99 year paid in full rights to the branding. This hurts to hear. I buy tons of H√§agen-Dazs.
I have talked to multiple dermatologists and for sensitive skin they only recommend Cera Ve or Cetaphil. Any other alternatives?
It includes Maybelline? Fuck, guess I'm getting a new foundation.
Not to mention Perrier and San Pellegrino... Fuck Nestle.
Cerave too? That's the only product that doesn't give me any problems
NYX? God damn it. I like NYX.
My dad bought deer park on his most recent visit. That is the nastiest water I have ever had
They almost got away with it
I surprisingly but very little of their products! I have no problem eliminating every last one of them from my life!
If they are garbage then why are people buying them?
Looking at that list I'm like "Great, I don't think I buy anything from any of those companies." Then I remembered that you can't really effectively boycott something you weren't going to buy anyway.
Haagen Dazs? That's primo stuff.

Nestle is inhumane corporatism personified :(
But DiGiorno...
Purina has some great dog food, specifically the Pro Plan line. Pro Plan sensitive skin is the only food my dog will eat regularly that keeps his allergies at bay and give him normal poops. Haagen Dazs is overpriced but good quality as well.
Try Freschetta. So much better imo
Many, many years. Which is funny seeing as my granddad and a tone of people in the 40's and 50's went swimming in there.
The problem is Florida Man subsists in part on Zephyrhills. That shit is delicious.
yeah! eat some faces!
I would say meth is more Missouri... here in Florida, we derive our power from a cocaine/ bath salt mix
From what I last heard, they are now astroturfing eastern Washington to get their shitshow up and running.
New story at the top of the hour, Florida man praised as water rights hero.
Grew up in Strawberry Point, the country water was pretty good but city water is city water. Ames is probably hands down the best.
Have you talked to anyone from your local water utility or city government? Or maybe the FDA?
What does that have to do with being lazy? More like snobbish about water or something. lol
Yepp lazy or people too good for tap water. I‚Äôd wager 99% of tap water is perfectly fine to drink *glares at flint*
lol i feel like this is the larger issue. a lot of people just DON'T like tap water, regardless of what it tastes like.

boggles my mind.
Nonsense.

Often water rights are controlled by the federal government in Western states, even in California.

https://www.npr.org/2018/06/28/624156334/nestl-offered-permit-to-continue-taking-water-from-california-stream


They didn't "sell the water rights" they issued permits.  They continue to issue these permits.

In Florida, these are water use permits controlled by the State.  The State can simply not issue, or decline to renew these permits, on the grounds that the impact on environment would outweigh any paltry monetary benefits.
Exactly. Nestle doesn't just take the water, the local government gives them a permit. Some local governments in my area have denied permits for Nestle Waters.

>the company is seeking permission to take more than 1.1m gallons a day from the natural springs
No need to seize the property back, just regulate the extraction to the point it isn't economical.
The article is about an application for renewal of an expired permit in florida.  California probably isn't immediately relevant
Well, just the cheap and processed food world which, given how much Westerner's eat of it, is a lot.
Eh...check P&G some time.
Very interesting ! I've been to all the western states and I would say most people had their stainless steel water bottle with them
I do this and so does almost everyone I work with does this.  I even have a water dispenser at home with refillable jugs.  Growing up in Northern California kind of made me a water nazi.
Which is the point I make to people that rag on America after seeing the news or reading Reddit.

We're literally massive with a shit ton of people, varying cultures and lifestyles galore.

One thing doesn't even mean the same thing one county over let along through the entire country. 

It's like they don't realize just how many policies and shit are in place to try and keep everyone happy and it's set up even further state to state. 

I'm not saying America is perfect but it's not the easiest place to run bc of all this almost needless freedom
Was going to say, Zurich is literally full of fountains
Was just thinking...  "ah, I can see how an international student in a heavily metro area could have missed a trip to a suburban Costco/Sams."
Generally, small and local businesses aren't looking to expand to national levels. For example, most butcher shops don't plan to become a nationwide franchise. Same goes for most bakeries, candy stores, bookstores, coffee shops, pet stores, health-oriented grocery stores, etc. They're usually owned by people who just want to make a living, and generally employees at smaller businesses will be a bit more knowledgeable than someone you'd find at Walmart.

Smaller businesses might have their downsides, but it's still worth supporting them. In this economy, not many businesses are likely to suddenly explode and reach Fortune 500 status anytime soon.

Soda: bottled water, with added corn syrup.  Yum.
Wow, that's a very intelligent way to discuss responsible use of a natural resource. It's almost like that one quote that people like to use is misleading bullshit. 



But we are on Reddit. No way does misleading bulshit ever make it to the front page here!/s
Literally \*worse than Hitler\*, Did I stutter!
>Jesus can we just not nestle already people

Kinda works.
Most people are unaware, glad there's reddit to have an open discussion about it and hopefully change some hearts.
That's not really accurate, they're not a monopoly. They're disgustingly unethical shithole of a company, but they're not a monopoly
It couldn't be, we broke up the monopolies over 100 years ago.
Oligopoly, but yeah.
So they own hot pockets, friskies, tidy cats, fancy feast, and all my favorite candies? Well f#$&
Damn, they own 4 of the biggest frozen pizza brands. All that fake competition.
I think I heard the collective groans of millions of people planning to boycott Nestle and decisions to do so suddenly vanished, as I read the line " Starbucks (Perpetual License) "
I just read up on how nestle purposefully misrepresents its nutrition information on its foods to make it seem like it's healthier than it actually is. 

But coming from a company who abuses free child labor can we honestly say we're surprised?
It's because they still want your money so they will offer a product line that appeals to people that hate companies like Nestle without making it widely known that they own it.
Probably the best thing to happen to the planet. We‚Äôre such a burden.
>No free market advocate or economist with half a brain wouldn't agree with you.

Well, he did clarify it was for the right-wing Trump supporters.
I think it's US-centric. You might have luck looking for nestle in the app, there may be a list for different areas. But yes, Nestle owns a LOT of stuff.

No argument here but I hate water out of plastic anyway.  I prefer glass anyway so a Brita + glass mug is my go-to.  

A case or 2 in storage is just planning ahead
I keep my bathtub full just in case and change it every other christmas
I store large gallons of water instead of small bottles. Could never understand why someone would buy a small plastic bottle of water ... unless that was the ONLY source of water
Don't even bother with that. Just save a half dozen old milk jugs, wash them throughly, and fill them with water. It'll keep, it's WATER.
Tap water can taste pretty gross some times.
I would recommand it in older homes. Lead ain't a joke and it's not always the city's plumbing fault but also your home's plumbing.
But why bother not using it? A little bit of recycled plastic and activated charcoal is hardly the worst thing we do to the environment and it protects against all sorts of potential issues in water.
I know I don't need one but once in a while they send a notice for contamination sure to high levels of blah blah blah.  It's just for taste preference and peace of mind
With the water quality una lot of states being what it is.. I‚Äôll stick with my filter
Americans in general are extremely over paranoid about how easily you can get Food or Liquid poisoning. 

It‚Äôs honestly one of the things that shocked me the most when I immigrated here from Eastern Europe. Back in my home, food safety was an after thought so I pretty much drink straight out of any faucet now and have extremely lax food safety standards(yep I‚Äôll eat that piece of chicken your dropped on the floor) and I have yet to ever get food poisoning in the US. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad thing at all, I guess in the end it‚Äôs good to be vigilant about what you put in your body, but it‚Äôs definitely an observation I‚Äôve made since I‚Äôve lived here.
If I pour a glass from the tap in Chicago you can see all the particles swirling around and nobody wants to drink that even if it is safe. I use Brita for that reason.
Are you a penguin?
My area has concentrations of lead comparable to Flint, it‚Äôs absolutely imperative that we use some sort of filter
The EPA's last published national overview including plastics was in 2015, with a national recycling recovery rate of 34.7%.

Of the 34.5 million tons generated, only 3.1 million tons (9%) of plastic was recovered, the smallest rate of all recyclable materials. 26 million tons went straight to a landfill.

It either gets recycled sold as raw material or put in land fills.
Why simply be evil when you can be Spectre/Umbrella Corp/Hydra/FIFA level evil?
Shipping is usually the reason unless it‚Äôs Evian or Fiji or something where the location it‚Äôs from is the draw. Water‚Äôs heavy by the truckload, so why not save on shipping costs and bottle more locally?
They do. All of the spring water sources in the United States must maintain spring flow and are highly regulated by state and federal agencies. The bottled water companies want fresh groundwater which means they're not mining it, it is replenished every year by natural recharge.  It is nice that most of the comments here focus on the bottles which indeed have an environmental impact, instead of the false stories of draining aquifers.
Why not make a law that says farmers who need to pump water to grow crops are treated differently than companies bottling water?
You mean the communist conspiracy to taint my vital essence and bodily fluids?
The only bad thing with fluoride is that it can be dangerous to work with from the water operator‚Äôs perspective. The benefits far outweigh the risks.

That one hurt me too. Guess I‚Äôll be alternating between Talenti and Halo!
What about Ben and Jerry's?
We can always make our own. Cut down on the icecream by extension too lol.
Buy half of the amount you usually do so it only goes to the non-Nestle half.
Talenti has the best strawberry of anyone but no one seems to sell it near me anymore.
They make generic cetaphil.  It's so cheap and its exactly the same.
I used to use Cera Ve and I recently switched to the neutrogena hydro boost because it only has a mild scent (still a little stingy, but it doesn't cause a flare up of my eczema), but I've been thinking about trying the Hada Labo Gyokujun face wash.
Hey I have eczema and I use First Aid Beauty (F.A.B.), available at Sephora and Ulta. For body soap I use Dove Sensitive or the Target or CVS equivalents. Good luck
Check out /r/SkincareAddiction, they'll definitely have good cleanser recommendations. You could also try the oil cleansing method if you're sensitive!
damn I love Pelligrino, time for something new.
Yup, bye Nesquik and Stouffer's, that's all I ever bought from Nestle anyway
Because clearly those people and their life decisions are wrong. Only OP has the refined tastes to determine what's garbage and what's gold. He's a true connisour of the ages.
The same reason people think Olive Garden is "fine Italian food", cost considerations and lack of experience with something better.
Have you tried generic oreos?  GARBAGE.
Because people don't care that much about eating garbage.
[deleted]
I personally prefer Tombstone or Red Baron, and both options are cheaper.  At the same price point as DiGorno, you can easily find something better.
More and more people are switching to Pro Plan with fantastic results. There's not gonna be a Purina boycott until the next wave of trendy dog blogs say to stop feeding it because of some reason they've decided is true this month. 

But if anyone really does want to switch because of Nestle, Iams has a good selection as well. I've had only shitty results on Hills products with every animal but many others have good results, and they test heavily and run studies (as do Purina and Iams). It's tough right now, all you want is what's best for your pet without being unreasonably expensive or risky.
Yeah no, as a Florida man Zephyrhills is nasty as fuck
You take that  back.
Zephyrhills water tastes like a hot shit in a warm pool.
nonono, you have to cut off the faces and roll them up like fruit-roll ups, stick them in a bottle of Nestle‚Ñ¢ water, reseal it, and mail them back to their families.
It's Oregon water and it's needed for ecological and economic reasons that don't seem so theoretical anymore. Eastern WA is a just downright scary politically so that is a good base for them, but I am not sure how that will help them in Oregon? 

A lot of people see this as a dead issue, but I've been wary of considering it dead. I'll make sure to check BARK once in a while.
To be honest I just straight don't trust them. I drink nothing but tap water and it tastes different every day.
Because it's much faster to grab a bottle of water out of the refrigerator than finding a glass and filling it (and getting ice)
why? dasani filters tap water. tap water is sourced usually from places like this. people drink fresh water. outside a few circumstances bottled water extraction doesn't really change the equation on water sources.
The amount of production and industrial dominance P&G has is breathtaking. It seems borderline impossible to live a life without using their products.
I was going to guess you studied in California or Oregon. The rest of the U.S. is different from those states. (to varying degrees)
A lot of the west coast US is very environmentally mindful and progressive. I live on the east coast and it's a mixed bag.
HA!  Are we crazy or what?
Nestle should be come a verb.

"Jesus would have never nestled someone!"
They're doing this because they've depleted the water in their other facilities and need to expand to maintain their numbers.

We don't know the long term consequences of depleting these deep aquifers yet.
They might be in some of the countries they prey upon, by owning a disproportionate amount of resources. Of course those countries might not have enforceable monopoly laws...
Their commitment to always being on the evil side of anything seems entirely deliberate.

How many companies are responsible for endangering elephants and chimpanzees in West Africa AS WELL AS siding with Russia in the dispute over annexed territory?

Anyone else get satisfaction from drinking out of a cold, clear glass? Stainless container are good sometime too.
The rental my parents live in came with a reverse-osmosis filter system with a spigot at the kitchen sink. Best water I've had in a while.
Look up brazilian clay filters, supposedly they are the best in the world. We got one recently and it makes water taste so much better, and it's always on a nice cold temperature too.
Be sure to save the greens for the vitamins
So, um, asking for a friend... do you sell this bath water by chance ?
What a wonderful holiday tradition
Underrated comment there, that shit made me laugh
I dont have space for that personally.  Buying waters before a hurricane strikes is easier for me then carrying supplies 24/7 with nowhere to put them.
Yea... We have to use filtered water plus some bottled water b/c the tap water is really not good to drink
Depends on where you live. I went to college in South Georgia and the sulfur was heavy in the water supply. If you didn't use a faucet or shower for a long period it would smell like Hell the first time you did. But the taste wasn't too noticeable, especially if you had plenty of ice.
I once did a water test test study on a bunch of different people that included tap water. I found something very interesting. It's the temperature of the water that influences people's taste moreso than the water. People who drink tap water often run the water from their tap in the cold setting then taste it. This tends to be less cold than their refrigerator. When you use a Brita filter you put the water back into your fridge and then you taste it once it's cold. Few people have a preference between filtered tap water and tap water if the temperature is the same unless the people know exactly what to taste for specifically to tell the difference between the two already.
Add some lemon or lime juice
Yep. I can smell and taste chlorine in our tap water. No thanks. I understand chlorine is used to disinfect water but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not supposed to be as strong as it is here.
It can even look pretty gross. Our tap is currently fucked and outputs an insane amount of chlorine. The water actually has a murky white look for about 10 seconds until it all clears up and, probably, falls to the bottom. Pretty gross.

And before the armchair hazmat response unit of Reddit responds; yes it's safe, yes it's being sorted, no it's not something that's causing us problems.
Make sure to check what filter you're using. Only [one specific](https://www.brita.com/replacement-filters/longlast/) Brita pitcher filter removes lead, and there are a couple of models it doesn't fit. It's also more expensive expensive than their regular filters (~$10 per longlast filter vs ~$5 per regular filter). Not sure about their faucet filters, I don't use one.
This is normal for drinking water, during filtration through rock and soil calcium and magnesium dissolve into water under the presence of CO2. This is commonly referred to "hard" water and other than being a nuisance on water heating, laundry and dish washing there is no health impact from any of these dissolved minerals.

Also don't take my word for it, here's what the EPA says https://epa-water.com/what-is-the-white-stuff-in-my-drinking-water/
Sounds like an issue with your building's plumbing. Chicago is actually reknowned for having really good quality and tasting municipal water. I know brewers who have located here specifically for the water.

Brita filters are still a good idea anyway; but you might want to have your lines checked because that's not a common Chicago water issue.
And now, since China isn't accepting our trash, the recovery rate is even less. It's not a cost-effective model anymore. We need to kill plastic at the source. And the only way that happens is if people start making better decisions and alternatives are explored.
We need the South Korean waste management model. Rather than being proficient in recycling, they've very effectively reduced the amount of waste they produce in the first place.
It's usually more carbon friendly to burn plastic waste than to turn it into other plastic products, so we burn it. Our local city just built a huge incineration plant just to do that.
This is a good real picture of recycling. Very little really gets recycled. There are mountains, about 60-100m tall and many miles long, of plastic waste shipped to India for recycling. This is near Chennai, in the south.

I hate to see so many people treat plastic like it is single use when a single cup or bottle or spoon can actually be used many 100 times. And then, the quality reusable products will probably outlast the person itself. But no, got to buy the 100th reusable bottle because it is a cute color, and throw out the good ones at home :(
I like how FIFA made that list.

I don't like how I can't really argue with the reasoning thereof.
A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual. Certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works.

Beautiful comment.
From their website under Vanilla:

Emulsifiers and stabilizers. Makes it cheaper buy taking up volume and selling by volume, and also by making the ice cream melt and refreeze better, making less care needed for shipping and handling, along with making the product a better consistancy at non-ideal temperatures. Easier to scoop and eat at low low temps and nicer to eat as it melts. Better reviews from people who don't know or care what ice cream is supposed to be.
Neutrogena is owned by Johnson & Johnson who have some major problems of their own. To be honest, it's nearly impossible to not support large, immoral, corporations if you live in a capitalist society like the US.  You can do the best you can to minimize your hand in their profits, but at the end of the day if CeraVe lotion is one of the only ones that works stick with that.
I use their hylauronic acid and lotion and it is so good. Not using Cetaphil will suck though, I have really bad eczema and acne and switching products will fuck up everything
I know! I used to love San Pelli's with some ice and scotch... maybe scotch with some ice and San Pelli's. :P
I realized after this post that I frequently buy deer Park Seltzer water üò¨ Never again
What's funny is you could actually go out to a great Italian restaurant for the same price as Olive Garden.
Oreos are generic Hydrox
I don't think you realize how many products Nestle owns. The comment above is a tiny list. They own over 2000 brands. There are many popular products that people like and use frequently and have no idea Nestle own. I wouldn't exactly say they are the "easiest company to boycott."

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Nestl%C3%A9\_brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)
It's DiGiorno
Honestly, I'd rather have delivery. There are some really good mom and pop pizza places that don't get the amount of business they deserve for the quality and price of their product.
Tombstone is owned by Kraft, and their frozen food division is owned by.... Nestle.
>On January 5, 2010, Kraft Foods announced it was selling its frozen pizza division to Switzerland-based Nestl√© Foods as part of a plan to use the proceeds to purchase Cadbury, a maker of dairy milk chocolate. In addition to Tombstone, this included other pizza brands including DiGiorno, Jacks and California Pizza Kitchen (frozen pizza). The Kraft frozen pizza division is now part of Nestl√© D.S.D. (direct store delivery).

Red Baron is owned by Schwann's, which recently sold the non-home delivery portion off to CJ CheilJedang out of South Korea.  Not too much connection to notoriously bad companies on that one.  They are second in market share in the frozen pizza business behind Nestle, at least in America.

They were, however, heavily implicated in a scandal of trying to buy/sell influence to the President of S. Korea back in 2016 before the then president was impeached for it.... so probably not too much better
I have some bad news for you then (just found out myself). Nestle apparently owns Tombstone as well according this this Wikipedia article:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Nestl%C3%A9\_brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)
Tombstone is still a Nestle product though. At least they stock it at retailers
Suppose I ought to try those then. Just grew up with those _being_ "pizza night" if it wasn't a big party.
Freschetta!  No one ever mentions them but they kick DiGiorno's ass seven ways from Sunday.
u/col-fancypants 's grandpa might be able to shed some light on that
That's because it's been in a fucking bottle on a truck for God knows how long. Zephyrhills tap water is fucking amazing stuff.
But who's more reliable for this info? The people running the water department or the people who get paid to install industrial grade water filters?

(Legit question - not from USA)
So you hide your glasses in places they're hard to find? 

Jokes aside, it really has a lot more to do with taste than pure convenience, they were sold on the whole "this is actually spring water" myth after all
Gonna try, here.
DC does it. Lots of people in the DMV area do as well. I can attest that it's popular on a lot of college campuses I've been to as well. I was just down in Charlotte and I saw a ton of people (mainly girls) using the tall, skinny bottles.
Taking a warm/hot shower and then a cold glass of water is a great way to start the day.
I hear Reverse osmosis is the some of the purest water you can get.  I'd love to try it sometime for comparison to tap
I totally get that. I live on the west coast, specifically grew up in western WA so I always had clean mountain water from the tap. Moving to CA gave me a culture shock. Can‚Äôt drink the tap & tax on all water purchased. 
I can only imagine how terrifying it is to live in hurricane country and worry about water during that time. 
I wish you luck in the upcoming seasons !
I always hear how unpleasant the tap water is in the US. At first I  assumed it was just an exaggeration considering the water in the UK is not exactly palatable but perfectly safe to drink but the way some of my acquaintances had carried on you'd think it was liquid limescale.
I'm concerned, is the Pur tap filter as good as a Brita filter?

My problem with Britas is that I drink about 200 fl oz of water a day but the pitchers only hold 80 Oz so I have to refill it 2+ times a day and they take 50 years to refill each time, then I have to wait for it to cool down in the fridge. So I use the Pur since it is faster to fill up a bigger pitcher and keep that in the fridge.
Yep. Anyone who thinks all major cities with good infrastructure have good water has never been to Jacksonville, FL. Just running a bath makes the whole house smell like rotten eggs.
I grew up practically ocean front and our water tasted like the inside of a seashell. Even our ice tasted nasty. We had to use either bottled water or a filter for drinking (as far as I remember it was fine to cook with and was generally pretty safe, just tasted like wet ass out of a glass)
I guess that's the definition of "some times".
Same with Upsate New York. Smelled like rotten eggs unless you ran the tap for a few minutes or showered beforehand. Smelling that before brushing my teeth with the water made me almost puke sometimes.
Lead is also a factor.
Also, letting tap water off-gas for a few minutes can DRAMATICALLY improve the taste. We used to have a britta filter pitcher in the fridge. Turns out, the water from the pitcher tasted better than the water from the tap even without the filter in place because it was colder and because it had off-gassed in the fridge before being served.

People aren't going to do it, we need corporations to start cutting down it's use and it will trickle down to the consumer.
The problem starts with oil, not plastic. As long as we use petroleum fuels for transport, plastic will be a cheaper environmental cost more times than not. For instance, my grocery store gets pallets of paper bags that have 3384 bags per pallet. The same sized plastic bag pallet has 96000 bags on it. Because of that, the paper bags take more oil (as diesel fuel) to get to the store than it takes to both produce and transport plastic bags, even if you count every paper bag as equivalent to 4 plastic bags. Also with that, all of the oil the paper bags require goes into the atmosphere. Essentially, paper bags drive oil companies to pull oil from the ground faster because they see a higher demand.

Don't get me wrong, reducing plastic is still very important. But sometimes the alternatives people go for turn out to be worse. Even reusable bags can take 5 months or more of consistent use before its better than using plastic bags every time, as long as it doesnt break before then from overstuffing.

Of course, theres many plastics that this wouldn't apply to, but I've met so many people that have an anything-but-plastic mindset, and they dont really consider the transportation costs. Once we have electric semi trucks powered by clean energy, this will be irrelevant. Hopefully that day comes sooner.
Here's alternatives!

It helps it's insanely expensive to throw away trash there.

so how is that considered recycling if they burn it?
 I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love. Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.
Fair, but they have a ton of safety and alarm systems around those canisters. What makes me super nervous is when they have liquid chlorine and fluoride next to each other. You don‚Äôt want to be anywhere near that shit if they spill
I don't understand what's bad about it from your posts. If all emulsifiers and stabilizers do is make of more ideal at a range of temps, what's the issue?
I don't give a fuck where it's from I just want chicken alfredo
last time i went to an italian restaurant i spent much more than 8.99 and din't get unlimited pasta, breadsticks and unlimited soup. idk what olive garden you go to or how cheap your italian restaurants are around you, but this just isn't true. olive garden has some great deals. it's not anywhere near as good as a mom and pop italian restaurant though.
Maybe where you live. The only good Italian near me is >$20/entree.
The only good Italian places in my town cost practically double what Olive Garden charges. I'm not pretending it's fine dining or anything, but those types of chain restaurants all fill the gap between fast food and expensive-but-great food here.
To be fair, most of the major corps in Korea seem to try the same thing.
And California Pizza Kitchen, it would seem.  And Buitoni.  That's a shame as the former is *also* better than DiGiorno, and the latter are tastier than the utter lack of effort required to prep them ought to allow.
So relieved my favorite trash pizzas, Totinos Party Pizzas, was not in that list.
My favorite frozen pizza is a brand called Screamin' Sicilian.  I have no idea how tied they are to a particular region, but I'd bet they have a wider reach than my next favorite (HEB Central Market).
Oh he said they used to hunt and camp there all the time. There's no telling what went in that water in the hey day of the pre bottling days
Depending on where one lives, the private corporation may be more trustworthy in this instance, and it kills me to have to say that. The Flint, Michigan water crisis (which is still ongoing, by the way, but is closer to resolution) is a prime example of a city government intentionally lying and falsifying tests about its water quality for years.
Most common brands of bottled water are usually municipal water. I.e. tap water.
I'm from Long Island and most people here don't give a shit about that kind of stuff, unfortunately. It's such a stressful and weird place.
Just depends on where you live. The country is massive, some areas have amazing tap water, while others you‚Äôd be better off buying a filter for.
I used to live in the North East, all of our water came from Windermere and Kielder, soft water and it was fantastic.

Recently moved to Dorset, and its hard water.  The limescale is ridiculous.  We've installed Brita filters and a magnetic clamp type device to grab magnetic particles from the pipes before they hit the boiler.  Its made it better, but bottled water would be better still.  I refuse to buy it though because of the environmental impact.

Nestle can go fuck themselves with a plastic recycled stabby type thing.

EDIT:  I'm talking about the North East of the UK here.  The Upper MA stuff in the comments had me confused :)

I mean I grew up in the PNW drinking tap water most of my life.  It wasn't until i moved to the south for college that I realized just how great our tap water is in the NW.  Some areas just have such high mineral contents that the filters become necessary.  I will say that PNW tap water is amazing though and I still drink straight from the tap up here so US tap water is very regional.
Flint Michigan should make anyone wary about water.
Depends on where you live and what you're used to and your risk tolerance. 

I never used a filter where I grew up in New England, and really like the "taste" of the water there. My parents use a dispenser/filter on their fridge, because they like the water really cold, but I prefer it straight from the tap.

In college, the water was disgusting. Metallic and vegetative tasting. Everyone had a brita pitcher in their fridge. It was, I guess, fine to drink, if you could. We had a pretty well published professor studying lead contamination in drinking water, so I would assume at least she would be testing it... or possibly experimenting on us.

Outside of boston, the water was fine. We kept a brita going because the town would do road work that would impact the water mains too often (causing a brown sludge to come out for a few days). 

Now I live in an area further south. Water is fine to drink, but really hard. I prefer the filter, and the previous owners had one built in under the sink. It tastes better that way, but I could deal with it if I had to.

A co-worker from upstate new york has stories about a town near where she grew up that had some real serious water contamination, resulting in a rare infection for people that drank the water. You hear about lead exposure in towns like Flint and now that town in New Jersey - it's hard to really trust the water. Granted, you're now trusting a company instead, if you get a filter.
there's a lot of sulfur in the well water down here in the Southeast, at least in my region in North Carolina. That shit smells like eggs and tastes bitter. Do not like. Got out of that shithole as soon as I could!
Where I grew up, my parents recieved a notice from the city every month about carcinogens in the water. They did this so they wouldnt have to do anything about it. It was a small town in rural North Carolina.
The US is pretty big with a lot of different water sources and treatment options. The entire water supply for my city comes from a natural reservoir filled with glacial melt water and it tastes better than most of what comes out of a bottle.

Then there are places that have water that I wouldn't brush my teeth with, let alone drink.
It depends city to city, but excessively high amounts of chlorine, chloramine, calcium, and magnesium (400ppm combined) is incredibly widespread, and 50ppm of lead is quite a commonality.    

If you want to see how bad tap water is in US cities, use it to water plants and watch them die. The pH is often 8.0 or even higher. It's not healthy at all.  It's no joke. And that's just the CITY reports - the water will be even worse quality for those living in neighborhoods with shoddy piping.    

Some places have perfectly good tap water, though. City I live in now comes out the tap at a pH of 7.2 with <1 ppm of lead and chlorine, and overall fluctuates 50-120 ppm combined of iron, calcium, and magnesium.
As a Scotsman, I‚Äôve always found water down south in England, particularly London, to be awful tasting. The water in most of Scotland‚Äôs taps could be straight out of a spring considering how delicious it is.

Not that I would ever buy bottled water, even in England, of course. I‚Äôm still a stingy Scot.
Mine is safe to drink, but its gross.  Taste of sulfur and chlorine.  I'd rather drink literally anything else, like a soda.  And I hate carbonated drinks.  
  
In fact, I'd bet anything that a big reason obesity is so big in the states is the crazy amount of soft drinks people drink over water.  Which will happen if your experience with water is limited to nasty ass tap water.  
  
I drink bottled water and love it.  Filters are a hassle and aren't really that much cheaper than spending 10 bucks a month on cases of bottled water.
I live in California, it's a big state, with the Southern part of the state having little to no water of their own. The South has a lot of the water brought down by aqueduct from the North, and endures a lot of treatment. The water in the Southern part, and even in the bigger cities in the Northern part are straight awful tasting. It actually has a strong enough taste to leave an aftertaste on your tongue if you don't brush your teeth.
Smaller towns in the Northern area have fresh water than isn't heavily treated, and that water is perfect. Where I live, the water is the cheapest in the state, while also tasting great. And that's just the one state, there are 50 of them, you have so much variety in water here. And most likely all of the bad tasting water is in the cities.
It massively depends on where you are in the US
Totally depends, in NY we have fantastic water. But some other states, not so much.
Someone said something about some areas having better water than others. That can be true, but on a really small scale. Depends on where your water comes from. One town gets its water from a local reservoir, its great. One gets it from somewhere else, its bad. 

Hell people that live on opposite sides of town can have drastically different water quality.
> considering the water in the ~~UK~~ south of the UK is not exactly palatable 

FTFY. Water tastes braw up here in Scotland.
My tap water tastes great.  My aunt a 2 hour drive away has water that is brown and smells of rotten eggs.
I've lived all over the United States. Some places each house had their own well and it was common to have a water softening system installed but the water still stunk like sulfur and tasted like rust.

Some of the larger cities I lived in actually had good drinking water. 

Now I'm currently living in Florida and the water smells like it comes straight from a swimming pool and literally tastes like it too. Even the foreigners here order their beverages with no ice because they don't want to drink the water.
Have you looking into an under sink filter? They aren't all that hard to install and cost around 40 dollars a year for filters.
Can confirm. As a child we visited relatives in J'ville a couple times and I can still remember my shock as I first tried to drink faucet water. Absolutely wretched.
You might be on well water, not city water.  A lot of older houses in Florida use well water because it was so easy to dig and hit the watertable.  If you investigate and learn that you are on a well, you can get rid of the sulfer smell by adding more salt to your water softener.   If you have one of [these](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Remove-Iron-from-Well-Water-Step-2.jpg/aid9611745-v4-728px-Remove-Iron-from-Well-Water-Step-2.jpg.webp) just add the salt to the shorter tub/barrel.
Sulfur... it's good for the urinary tract at least.
Depends on where you are in Jax. Neither my house nor my parent‚Äôs house has that issue with the tap water.
I feel ya. I don't mind most, "natural" tastes in water though. But I also drink out of the hose still.
Call the Oxford Dictionary people so they can change the definition of sometimes to

"Depends on where you live. I went to college in South Georgia and the sulfur was heavy in the water supply. If you didn't use a faucet or shower for a long period it would smell like Hell the first time you did. But the taste wasn't too noticeable, especially if you had plenty of ice."
True, older cities and towns are high risk.
What exactly is ‚Äúoff-gas‚Äù? I‚Äôm not familiar with that.
why would corporations do anything that would affect profits?

you need laws for returning plastic bottles to the producer for recycling and customers should be paying a 25 cent deposit per bottle to encourage returning them.
Agreed. But corporations typically ONLY respond to their bottom line. This is one of the situations where we, as consumers, hold all the cards. And given that I guess you're right. Most people are ambivalent and only consider their immediate needs - irrespective of anything else.
Good comment and thanks. 
However I'd like to think most understand the relationship between plastic and oil. And I"m sorry but I don't subscribe to the "Small adjustments don't matter in the face of huge issues." It all matters. Plastic ends up in the ocean or landfills. And, as I'm sure you know, it takes about 500 years for a plastic bottle to degrade. It's killing our oceans so I'm not sure if "low cost" at point of purchase comes close to the larger ramifications. My point was about plastic, one-use water bottles. And until someone can prove me wrong, I'll still believe it's a far inferior option.
I agree with your basic sentiment.

Graphic closing statement there
Okay this may sound strange, but I paid for a tour into one of those plants. It was fun, much more so than i anticipated. The main thing is of course they use it to produce electricity, basically repurpose it to provide something beneficial. I also learned that they burn the trash at such high temperatures that it doesnt release most toxic gases, including CO2 into the atmosphere and they filter out the rest.
Cumming is bourgeois. All good communists are volcel. We require our vital essences for the coming revolution.
Well, not every plant I've been in has the alarms or even some sort of access control, and that's what's scary.

Fortunately, those two systems are usually at least in separate rooms.
My kids love those and they're so cheap, therefore I love them as well.
It's more expensive than other pizzas in the market, but you get more product and much higher quality ingredients.

Plus you can pop the mustache off the box and wear it on your nose.
Screamin Sicilian is actually the best frozen pizza brand, this is scientifically backed
And some places are so bad, a filter won't do enough to make it drinkable. Smaller towns (I'm looking at you Michigan, though I love you regardless) can have horrendous water. Generally it's mostly the pipes being the issue, but it can vary. My wife's mom's house can't effectively use a filter, her best friend's house can't either. They almost have to buy bottled water to have drinking water. You could triple filter the water (I did this once while visiting and it was alright) but generally that takes excessive amounts of time to get enough water to cook or even drink.
I hear all the time that Memphis has amazing tap water.
Some *areas*? My grandmother who lives four miles away has amazing tap water, I fill up a jug with it when I get there. But mine at my home tastes like straight pool water. I do but water bottles because of how often I need cold water immediately (diabetic) but I always recycle them (my "allowance" is the deposits we get for return the bottles, as it's my household duty.)
One of the few things the North East actually leads the rest of the country in, as far as I can tell.
Can you tell me more about the magnetic thing pre-water heater? I have super hard water and am very curious
The tap water in the county next to mine is recently found to be causing brain tumors in small children and animals.

I'm gonna stick with bottled water for now
Good God is PNW water tasty. I had the same exact experience as you tho.
I think my favorite was being in Whistler seeing bottled "Whistler glacier" water for sale in the hotels. Did tourists think the tap water is trucked in from somewhere else?
Visited my Mom up in Oregon. Water is deposited as rain or snow and filtered through volcanic rock. It made it about as pure as could be. The craft breweries seemed like they were on every street corner because the water was so good.
Yep our water here in Portland OR is fantastic. I've been enough places to appreciate how lucky we are to get delicious clean tap water.
New England has some of the best tap water in the Country. It's better in taste and quality than most bottled water.
[deleted]
See, when I lived in NC, the tap water was great (both in Greensboro and Laurinburg). I live in Indianapolis now and if I'm not diligent my faucets will grow stalagmites there's so much mineralization.
Yeah, the small town in Alabama  where I went to school had sulfur water.

The fast food places couldn't even sell meals with drinks because the drinks that were made with it tasted like you fed a guy nothing but rotten eggs for a week, then shot a squirt of coke syrup up his ass.
Leaves a ring of yellow in sinks and bathtubs too.
Generally the issue with bottled water isn't the cost but the environmental impact of throwing away hundreds of plastic bottles. Much better to use a filter when possible to avoid all that waste.
I'm in a rental apartment so I hadn't even considered one that might require some plumbing. Are they easy to install?
I don't live there any longer, but I doubt a new apartment complex near the city center was on well water.
Chemically treated water will release volatile chemicals through evaporation if left to sit in the open. The loss of some of those chemicals can improve the taste. Its common for brewers and aquarists to leave water sitting for a couple of hours to reduce the amount of chlorine in their tap water.
As per mentioned in this thread, recycling is not an efficient means of reducing our plastic problem as it's ineffective at it's current model. Corporations have had a runaway effect with single use plastic, we've lived without the absurd amount of plastic before, we can survive again without it. It's just laziness and short term gains that corporations have been getting away with by their laxed governments. Governments need to step in and reward corporations that follow the new regulations or create other incentive programs to allow the effect of having profitable packaging practices. The consumer is not reliable enough to make this change, this needs to be changed at the top of the scale.
> I don't subscribe to the "Small adjustments don't matter in the face of huge issues." It all matters.

I'm sorry if I misspoke, I wasn't trying to make that argument at all, I agree that it all matters. I know the oceans are a critical part of our ecosystem. I just think that getting better at recycling would be a better option right now (and more feasible than changing the decisions of billions of individuals). I guess I see the atmosphere as a higher priority, so anything to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we're taking out and burning. My point was that sometimes plastic is the best way to achieve that goal, since consumption isn't going to change. I do agree that plastic water bottles do not fall into that category and are extremely wasteful, your comment just seemed more broad.
I‚Äôm from Michigan. This is very true especially in rural wells.
I'm in Orange county,Ca and have a 3 stage filter system, still have limescale in my coffee/tea pot and I have to replace our shower head about every 8 months.
[deleted]
Detroit checking in.  We have one of the nations very best water systems.  One of the few bright spots to the city (and surrounding areas)
San Angelo Texas, I literally went through two filters on less than 2 months before I said fuck it and got bottled water
Our water is like this. It‚Äôs the whole neighborhood- we‚Äôve tried filters and the water still smells and tastes like sulfur. It‚Äôs disgusting and yes, sadly we do buy gallons of water. We do recycle and also use glasses and refillable bottles so I guess that‚Äôs something
We also have a huge drug issue
Haha - it's not one aquifer. My college was in New England, and that, bar none, was worse than some untreated pond water I've actually ingested.
Boston is the only major city [>500k] in the US to meet EPA standards for public drinking water.
There have been a few. I can't find an article on the one I'm thinking of (a town near Utica) or recall if it was bacterial or what. I just remember hearing about some weird disease people from the town were getting that was otherwise really rare. A few years ago my coworker brought it up. She was looking at apartments, and a couple was on the tour with them asked if the water was safe to drink. The tour guide looked at them like they had three heads. My coworker (originally from NY state) asked where they were from - and yep, it was the same town. 

Anyway: there have been no shortage of water contamination stories in NYS over the years. Here are two I came across - one from manufacturing run off the other from military.

While they are easy to install (you just turn off the valve under the sink, disconnect the cold water hose under the sink, connect the faucet side to the filter, then the filter to the cold water connection, then open the valve slowly to make sure there are no leaks, I installed mine in about 10 minutes and just needed an adjustable wrench and a drill to mount the filter housing) you will want to speak with your landlord first.
There's also the ones that screw right to the faucet. I used that in my apartment.
Thanks. Where it gets tricky is that we KNOW solutions are available. We KNOW we could impact the environment positively with renewables and regulation. But we don't. So all we have is our power as consumers. So maybe, as it relates to plastic water bottles, it's a matter of educating people that they're spending more for less. It's just dumb. So my motto when I become King of the World will be, "Don't be dumb."
It really depends on the well. I also grew up in Michigan and our well water was incredible. I had friends just a few houses down who's water was awful.
My grandmother had so much sulphur and iron in her well water you'd get out of the shower smelling worse then when you got in. It also dyed everything a horrible sick yellow/orange if you washed it. For me her water was literally undrinkable even with a filter and a water softener. She'd buy those massive jugs of water like an old-school office water cooler from a company that delivered. They'd take away the old bottles and refill them for her though.

I'd say that counts as bottled water, but I give it a pass because 1) her water really was gross and 2) while it was bottled water the bottles were at least reused instead of being single-use.
Metro Detroit has some of the best tap water in the country. It's great.

Hasn't Nestle been taking from the Great Lakes forever? Or am I thinking about another company?
Talk to a plumber about getting a whole house system, not for filtration, but pH and salt adjustment. If you‚Äôre spending that much money in shower heads it should be worth it.
Just soak the shower head in vinegar. No need to replace it. It's just lime.
RO systems waste a ton of water too - when we looked at a whole-house RO system, it was something around 40% of the total water bill would have just gone down the drain.
RO systems waste a huge amount of water
Ah yes the good ole ro system.  Coming to you now for the low low price of an entire years worth of bottled water for one working adult.
I went to uni in the NE and it's actually depressing how bad the drug problem has gotten over the past 4 or 5 years alone
Really? Moreso than other areas? Everywhere has its bad places but I didn't think it was that bad.
Yeah, its horrible how bad my hometown has gotten.  The Uni is one of the bright spots, but holy shit, the town doesn't endear students to want to stay.
Western mass has some of the best water in the state, only beaten by Maine.

Though the town's here can have really good or bad water depending how much chlorine the town adds.
Ha ha no shit.
The Foss resevoir in Framingham smells like a fish farted on a dirty beach cracker
Thanks mon ami! That actually sounds like a project I can complete with my stupidfingers. I'll definitely check with the leasing office though.
I have a Pur filter like that, there is an attachment that screws to the faucet and then you snap the filter on. But if it's not as good then I will switch.
"*Mr Schneider described the "global coffee alliance" with Starbucks as "a great day for coffee lovers around the world"*."

Global coffee alliance sounds like an evil syndicate that Batman needs to defeat. 
[deleted]
Lol now I can avoid both companies at onc
Oops, I‚Äôm never going to Starbucks again.
Nestle?  As in "We've pulled some shiat to buy water from the ground that you're short on just so we can sell it back to you dumb powerless farks at twelve times the price we paid for it"  Nestle?  Those guys?
Nespresso at Starbucks. I heard you like overpriced coffee, so we added overprice espresso to your Big Mac Sugar drink. Enjoy!
Can't wait to try the new Starbucks KIT-KAT
Nestle the water thieves. 
Nestl√© is an evil company. 

I traveled through Europe 30 years ago and I remember being able to get the best cup of coffee in the world at any train station. They all had an espresso machine and they were all independent. Now they all serve Nescaf√© instant crap.

Nestl√© is an evil company. 
Didn't go to Starbucks much in the past, certainly won't be going there  anymore after this.
Well there goes human rights
Awesome, I can boycott two shitbag companies at the same time.
NESTLE uses child labour and STARBUCKS is fair-trade...hmm..
**Now** is the time to boycott both Nestle and Starbucks - kill two birds with one cup of coffee, sotospeak.
Man, I actually liked Starbucks as a company for a while there, too.
Like I needed another reason to not buy Starbucks overpriced swill, but hey, this does make it easier.
Fucking water thieves.
It all comes across the ocean in the same ginormous tankers. When it arrives, they bid on it by the ton. The trick is in the roasting. Nestle is one of the big 3 water companies privatizing the global water supplies. Buy Free Trade, at least you know you're helping out the ones who work the hardest and need it the most. 
Coffee is a hot commodity.
This is definitely the end of me supporting Starbucks, not that they'll notice, but I don't fuck with anyone that fucks with Nestle. 

What sucks is I constantly travel, and I need coffee - I know what I'm getting no matter where I am with Starbucks.  A lot of people talk shit about their regular coffee, but it's better than most of the shit out in the wild. 

Fuck 'em. 
I don't really do the whole "vote with your wallet" shit, but Nestle is just so disgusting I might have to avoid Starbucks from now on. 
Why? Starbucks is incredibly overrated.
Can we have r/nestlehate and post about brands that are Nestle and all the horrible Nestle things that Nestle nestles
That's it.  I can live without Starbucks.
Is Starbucks starting to wane in popularity? Over the past several years in my area we went from 0 Dunkin Donuts to like 5, and their morning lines seem to regularly trounce Starbucks throughout the day.
Nestle pays Starbucks $7.1bn to slap the Starbucks name on whatever swill they were already selling.  
What a post about Nestle?  RAAAGE!
How the fuck is Netflix gonna sell coffee? Makes no sense. 
Nestle and Starbucks, two companies that have too much money and are shady fucks.
If you would actually read it "The deal means Nespresso machine owners will be able to buy Starbucks coffee branded pods for use in their equipment."
I like Starbucks coffee. 
Therein lies the problem. 

Keep promoting basic human goods as something one person can own all of
Company does a bunch of shit for profits that piss people off.   
Company makes deal to sell product through another company who has a consumer base that gives 0 fucks in reality and will still buy the damn coffee.   

Both companies profit.  

Sounds like your average company activity.
So what does this mean for PepsiCo and the North American Coffee Partnership?
Starbucks liberal leaning and nestle water is not a human right. I guess I'm no longer going to Starbucks. That was the last nail in the coffin.
Nestle: scumbag company you need to boycott, and not because of this, because of how they steal water globally to sell at a ripoff price.
Why? Nestle's coffee is miles better than Starbucks'. 
Nestle could simply sell its own coffee.
You couldn't pay me $7.1bn to take their coffee...
Just replace alliance with cartel.
Nestle already has Cereal Partners Worldwide with General Mills.  Global Coffee Alliance sounds a bit more menacing.  They're stepping up their game, it seems. 
Sounds more like who the d list is off fighting while Batman and Superman are saving the planet. Booster Gold is on the case.
In one of the original superman movies he legitimately fights an alliance of villains trying to destroy world coffee crops to raise prices.

It was for revenge actually. Superman III
Yeah, real "Silver Age" stuff.
Narrator: Somewhere, near Florida Swamplands the GCA is planning a diabolical plan to replace all of Earth Coffee with an extraterrestrial mind altering drug that is similar to earth coffee. With most members of the Justice League occupied in another galaxy saving a civilization from a supernova, it is up to Batman and Robin and the Wonder Twins and their pet Gleek to stop the GCA from succeeding. Stay tuned to find out. 

Edit: Tried to make it like the 70's cartoon by Hanna-Barbera Super Friends. 
The bad side in Command & Conquer.
Any alliance with Nestle, honestly. 
Isn't this the plot of Deus Ex: Invisible War?
>Mr Schneider described the "global coffee alliance" with Starbucks...

Anyone else hear the star wars imperial march when they read that?
"We demand to be taken seriously"
Let‚Äôs be real here.  If someone was giving *you* 7.1 Billion Dollars to do something you didn‚Äôt want to do, wouldn‚Äôt you do it too?
Starbucks stopped caring about that shit a long time ago. Just a marketing gimmick.
To be fair - Nestle agreed to source their beans from Starbucks as part of the deal, so Starbucks can still push fair-trade if they want. 
It's fair in Nestle's eyes. Either you accept your evil overlord or you die. Can't get much fairer than that! (your kids may still die)
According to the article Nestle is going to be distributing Starbucks coffee. 
It is fair trade coffe is it not?
That's nice. Imagining that publicly traded companies have a raison d'√™tre that's something other than maximizing profits.
You dead ?
I was ready for a Starbucks boycott too, but Nestle paid to sell Starbucks coffee in its stores, not Starbucks selling Nestle coffee in its stores.

Can still drink Starbucks and boycott Nestle.
You don't go to Starbucks for the coffee, its shit.  You go for everything else.
Drop the coffee all together. Sucks at first but well worth it in the long run. 
I predict that within the next few years, certainly not more than ten, Starbucks will cease to exist. It is this generation's Blockbuster.
Also the "No, third world mums, don't breastfeed your children! They get stronger with Nestl√© Infant Formula^tm !" guys.
Exactly bad move Starbucks
Where is this happening?
Yes, the same Nestle that uses child slave labor overseas. I'm sure this Nestle will be a beloved supplier of the Starbucks target demographic.
Yes. It‚Äôs a match made in heaven, really. I can‚Äôt think of two companies more deserving of each other.
Nestle? As in "aggressive marketing" of breast milk substitutes, particularly in developing countries, largely among the poor that led to the 1970s boycott? And prevented me from ever getting Nestle Quik as a kid? Those guys?
My sentiments exactly

They aren't short on water in Michigan, especially in that area
Its vice versa. Nestle is paying to be the distributor for Starbucks, not Starbucks distributing Nestle items. 
Spell it "espresso" unless you want to get pistol whipped by a portafilter and cafiza thrown in your eyes 
Read the article dude, or even the title for that matter. Starbucks isn't selling anyone's coffee but their own, Nestle paid Starbucks $7B for the right to use Starbucks branding and sell their coffee.

But, don't let that get in the way of your attempt to start an anti-corporate circle jerk!
>Nespresso at Starbucks

No, that's not what's happening. Read the article. Damn.
Not in the US.  Hershey owns the rights to KitKat here.
They're entering the phone software industry now?
Seems like almost no one in this entire thread read the article. Starbucks is not doing anything with Nestle or their products, Nestle is simply paying $7B to license the Starbucks brand and sell their coffee. 
isn't that a book?
That is the worst reason ever on why a company is evil
Don't blame Nestl√© for that. Blame consumers for being ok with nescafe. If your average customer at a train station demanded unique espresso beans at machines, they would be there. 
It doesn't impact the stores. Why would it change you going there?
but will you keep stocking up your nespresso machine?
I don't drink coffee, and I reveled in Teavana and their overpriced shit tier tea closing retail locations, but they're still at Starbucks... Luckily, I live in Philly and high quality tea is starting to get some steam (hah) behind it, even in La Colombe and Saxbys. Fuck Nestle. And fuck Starbucks even more for partnering up with these assholes.

Your first and last sentences seem at odds. ?
Unless it's cold brew.
I'll pour-over this one all day.
Starbucks is/was fine, and a coffee you know is better than rolling the dice.

I think the issues with Starbucks have been obvious, they move in near local businesses in a pretty obvious display, and they serve what I would call ‚Äúcaffeinated milk shakes‚Äù.

For their problems, they have a lot of programs in place to support their employees.
pay for that brand affinity 
i think you know what you have to do
Pretty easily. Starbucks coffee tastes like burnt dog shit. You could buy a bucket of the cheapest coffee in a grocery store and it'll taste better. 
That's cause Dunkin donuts don't give a fuck and sells sugar. At least you know what you are getting into with them.
Not if you read the article
Just gimme that sweet rage karma
Yea I don't think a lot of people commenting read the article, which is sad because it's a really short article.  They just saw Nestle and went off the rails, spewing the same ol' water thieving mommy killing stuff that gets posted every time Nestle is brought up.  No, I don't support Nestle or Starbucks, but this article does not say what people think it says.
Preach brother
No one owns all of coffee
You're not wrong. People being upset about it are also not wrong. It's win win.
What were the other nails? Being ‚Äúliberal leaning‚Äù?
It might be similar to what American breweries do in that they exchange either money or material with someone like Anheiser Busch, distribution is a large part of the game.
There are few companies shadier than Nestle. Not that I bought starbucks coffee before, but now I'm definitely going to avoid buying their coffee.
I would but those damn goblins banned me ever since I sided with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.

Shit and it‚Äôs the Apple of coffee products
I highly doubt it
You clearly have no idea what you're talking about, unless you can provide some short summary on why you believe this to be true. 
Blockbuster's failure was mostly due to technological obsolescence combined with a dated business model, and Starbucks certainly isn't facing that. In fact, the majority of the physical brick and mortar video rental industry has collapsed, and the main players that have survived don't use that same model (redbox, Netflix, gamefly?). What possibly makes you think that Starbucks will lose nearly 27,000 locations (and that doesn't even account for sales in food markets) in 10 years?!
Not a snowballs chance in hell, SBUX is huge. 
This story was proven to be false
[California](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nestle-water-selling-diverting-bottled-arrowhead-san-bernardino-forest-california-a8130686.html).  [Michigan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/29/nestle-pays-200-a-year-to-bottle-water-near-flint-where-water-is-undrinkable), too.  The CEO of Nestle famously testified, "The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value."
Amazon+EA
Oh so even better. So even the beans cost more now. Sounds like a win for customers.
barista bully
Would you like a Venti Caffe Misto to go with that whine?
Nestle doesn't make any candy bars in the US anymore. I guess they sold off their confections business so they could come after all the coffee. If they eventually own all the water and you need water to make coffee, this is quite the business plan.
Curious George and the Ebola Virus 
Yes I wrote it.
Yeah I mean Nestle has bought up the rights to water in 3rd world countries, and made it illegal for people to drink directly from lakes they live beside (that they have been drinking from for 100s of years).


Or there was the time they sent fake nurses to hand out free formula to breast feeding women for 2 months and convinced them it was better than breast feeding.  Then after 2 months all of the women had stopped lactating and they couldn't breast feed anymore and nestle then sold them the formula, and also the treated water.  But many couldn't afford the formula, and almost all couldn't afford treated water so they had to use untreated water.  So some died of water born diseases and some starved to death.  Pretty sure killing hundreds of babies tops shitty coffee.
Kinda like saying voting doesn't matter...
I don't know a single person that owns a Nespresso machine. I've never even heard of it. Everyone here has kuerig machines or regular coffee maker or French press
Have you tried Adagio? I found them to be much better than Teavana.
Because both companies have proven track-records of being shitty, Nestle more than most companies. Also, it's common practice for companies to reduce expenditure on production and milk their brand to maximize profits. I'm expecting a drop in quality when new labels start popping-up with the Nestle logo on it.
Cuz coRpoRaTiOnZ R eViL mAn 
Not hard to make yourself at all. Even if you choose to buy the expensive equipment you will still save more than their over-priced bs. And I'm not replying as if this was a serious question. I'm going of the assumption this was a sarcastic question lol.
Tim Horton's.
Not OP, but they did a few CSR things that were well regarded. A chain with fair trade coffee wasn't really common in Europe when Starbucks came over, IIRC, and encouraging the use of reusable cups was kinda neat too.

EDIT: Note that I don't know about differences in business practices between Starbucks in different countries, and from reading stuff on Reddit, my impression is that they aren't doing as much in that regard in the US. 
For one they do things like paying for 10 college classes for employees. Small steps but you don't see many companies doing things like this.

I don't have a strong opinion on Starbucks either way, but I thought that was cool of them.
Thanks a latte for being thoughtful
I don't know how :)
I've started getting [El Injerto Bourbon](https://store.fincaelinjerto.com/).  A light roast bean that they roast and pack at the farm in Huehuetenango, Guatemala.  A little pricey compared to grocery store beans, but a hell of a lot cheaper than Starbucks...and no burnt taste.  Mild as fuck and nice caffeine content.
The pike place roast, which is most commonly served on tap, is shit. The whole bean coffees are a lot better. I prefer the veranda and the kona. 
This is true, but if you are in an airport or rest stop- go ahead and go to Starbucks and get an americano. Totally fine 100% of the time. Their regular brewed coffee is ass but espresso and hot water is hard to fuck up.
Oh you think Nestle is going to honor agreements with Starbucks coffee supplies for more than a hot minute.  That's cute.  
wait, what? people based their responses on just the headlines?!?  On Reddit? INCONCEIVABLE! 

edit: SPELLING
Company taking sides in general. Fighting with trump about policy. Sometimes just want to get away from stupid things. Starbucks loves helping people refugees with pledge and other charities etc. Nestle is bottle more water in Michigan as bottle water is pulled from the public. Nestle CEO think water is not a human right. Just rubs you the wrong way. Or will we see part of every sale of nespresso Starbucks goes to supplying water for Michigan. 
Nestle is just selling Starbucks coffee not actually buying Starbucks or taking over any of the Starbucks supply/processing chain. 

Not the perfect analogy but... not buying SB because of this would be like not buying a certain brand of ketchup because a grocery store that treated you shitty once sells that product, despite the fact that so does every other grocery store in town. 
You should avoid Starbucks because it s garbage coffee. 
What if I offered you $7.1bn to buy it... would that change your mind?
Hmm must be because they are getting water from Michigan 
Well all/2
That‚Äôs just what the DC cinematic universe needs to catch up to Marvel. Dog-welding.
Thank-you.

Just, thank-you.
Yeah, that set of four are great for stupid fun.
It would make sense, investors tend to be greedy enough to plot their unknowing demise.  Human greed is usually what ruins a business, not customer satisfaction....
I would have to say you're totally wrong. Starbucks puts out their retail manufacturing for bid (Not the actual Starbucks store coffee products, but what is sold at Wal mart and gas stations and etc). Why do they do this? Because they don't have the infrastructure to develop all of these products. Nestle and other companies do. Not only does this help with starbucks balance sheet and income statements, but also helps with the overall management of their company. I believe Kraft was developing the retail goods before Nestle bought them. I could be wrong. But, "most people" don't like kraft (comment section stating they won't buy starbucks due to this deal, but why were they buying before if they don't like kraft?). Also, this is similar to Mcdonalds. Do you think they manufacture McCafe Keurig K-cups or their new bottled coffess? No, they don't. Private label brands manufacture them to Mcdonalds' specs. This is a huge business behind the scenes that you and many people in the comment section seem to have no idea about (not trying to attack you or be rude with that comment)
I've been investing in Starbucks for a few years.  (They have a decent dividend every 3 months...)

They aren't in trouble, though their stock has been stagnant for the past 3 years or so.  They keep re-investing money into the brand and into expanding.  Starbucks just started operating in China, one of the biggest economies in the world.  

Imagine getting 1.4 billion people excited about frappachinos and $2.50 drip coffees.  Almost five **times** the population of the US.  

So, Starbucks is doing just fine.  
Some companies can "circle the drain" for decades, so don't bet on their disappearance just yet.
Wait, you have 7.1 asses?

Honestly why I hate them anyways. The people you see in there... I bet they savor their own farts.

Wow, looks like I touched a nerve! I guess I have the naive idea that Americans, particularly younger folks facing underemployment, student debt, and the increasing costs of housing, healthcare and basically everything related to raising a family will someday soon realize that Starbucks is basically offering a luxury product. It's a cup of coffee. I love coffee. I don't happen to need it on the street generally but when I do I prefer not to pay, what $3.50, $5.00? That adds up if consumed daily. I guess I believe that things like bottled water, which costs way more than gasoline and pollutes at least as much, should be among the things we, and particularly young adults, should be walking away from. Starbucks will suffer based on the fact that people will realize they can make coffee from beans.
But, I may be wrong, of course. Consumers gonna consume. And judging from the downvotes, they are quite defensive about it. Time, and the economy will tell. I stand by my prediction.
First of all, you are very smart, thanks for the info. My theory is that within the coming years, Americans will not have the pocket change for a gourmet coffee. Have a nice day.
You say it was proven to be false, yet provide no sources.  
Wow.

I imagine they're working on a way to restrict access to breathable air, as well. 
You're cutting out pretty damn important context. He's basically saying "water is a finite resource, thus we need a system to limit its use to avoid draining it all", hence the "market value" bit. 
[Ontario, Canada](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nestle-continues-to-extract-water-from-ontario-town-despite-severe-drought-activists/article31480345/)
The rest of the quote is "Personally, I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff a value so that we‚Äôre all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there."
Yeah, that's not really happening in those places. 

Like Michigan is surrounded by some of the largest sources of fresh water on the planet. Do you *really* not understand that Flint's water issues have literally nothing to do with a lack of water to pump? They messed up the city's piping which taints what they send through it, Nestle had zero impact on that. There's plenty of groundwater to pump. How do you not know this lol

Pumping water for human consumption is one of the least impactful uses for water that happens. If you're mad about groundwater in drought stricken places it's the agriculture, heavy industrial factories and golf courses you should be looking at curbing.
except they're not buying the water and there isn't a short supply of fresh water in Michigan...
I don't think this means that starbucks isn't selling their own. My understanding was that this is for the pre-packaged items that you can buy in your grocery store. They need a distributer, so I don't know that Nestle vs any other would be more or less. 
Here is a copy and paste that I used to reply to another user. It sounds like you don't understand private labels and manufacturing food products that goes on behind the scenes.

Per the NewYork Times reporting on this, Star bucks will still source/buy the beans for retail sale, but Nestle will roast the beans in accordance to standards that star bucks specifies in their licensing agreement, as well as package them.

Nestle is recently under new management and is trying to solidify their brand a bit, they just sold their Chocolate division to Ferrero group for ~3b USD, most likely to help offset the cost of the star bucks purchase as well. Nestle is trying to advertise to the 18 ‚Äì 34 group as well ("millennials") who typically don't drink instant coffee, but preferr ground coffee instead. Anecdotally, I've noticed them advertising/pushing their "Gold" instant coffee recently too though in grocery stores.
No poop for you! Come back one year!
No thanks! my tears require 9 bars of pressure
I can find no evidence of your first claim that they made it illegal to drink from lake *or* that they even bought up water rights in third world countries.

The baby milk formula thing is all pure bullshit that reddit spouts day in and day out. An environmental group made it up to do a smear campaign against Nestle. Nestle sued them for defamation and won in court
No they didn't
Yes! I'm drinking Adagio right now, actually, their Assam varieties are good for the price. For higher range tea, I like What-cha but my daily tea is typically Adagio or Ito-en. I worked at Wegmans, and their bulk loose tea is from Ito-en and very good quality for the price. 
Tims "espresso" drinks come from a machine that mixes hot sugar powder and water. Thats not coffee.
I thought Reddit hated them too
Tim's coffee is made with old ground up hockey gloves and jock straps.

Starbucks has a coffee from huahuatengo as well but it is only available seasonally. It is not marketed as much, but certain starbucks sell lots of single-origin coffees. Ymmv.
They have to if it's contractually binding, else they no longer sell anything Starbucks at all.
Also not a perfect analogy, but it's like Starbucks accepting payment in known blood diamonds in exchange for allowing warlords to profit from their products. 
Thanks for clearing that up. I was under the impression that Nestle was paying Starbucks to sell Nestle coffee. English can be ambiguous at times.

Oh they know what they are doing. A valid strategy is pushing to wring out the last bit of revenue influx before dumping your investment even if it means the company will fail faster. 

Investors only care about the company up until the point they plan to exit.
I'll use your own phrase. Let's be real.

This isn't the fault of some nebulous group of "investors". We did this. This is America. This is the form American consumerism has taken and the cost to be paid for it all in one.

We made the economy this way so we could have the things we want. If we want to change it then it's up to us to push for legislation along those lines. Otherwise idly complaining about human greed as an abstract concept just results in nothing getting done.
I have a feeling that they know it, because a business to an investor and shareholders and all these people is like a fucking condom.  It's something to be used vigorously for as long as they possibly can until they blow their load in it and then throw it away for another condom to use.
This could also be a viable way of them actually extracting some value from the Teavana acquisition. Selling the tea in larger quantities and as different types of units (bags vs bottled) at retail might help salvage what thus far has basically been misfire of an acquisition.
I get what you are saying. I'm not sure Starbucks is in McDonalds' space though. I think them acting like they are will backfire, because they will be entering the 'race to the bottom' market carrying premium brand pricing and self-selecting customers. Who knows though, maybe they can make the transition to the McMarket, maybe they already have. The choice of Nestle as a partner definitely represents a change in business for them.

That's nonsense, candlejack doesn't exi
You didn't touch a nerve :) Thank you for replying, but I must say you are giving consumers to much credit. One thing consumers love to pay for is convenience. Starbucks had/has the first mover advantage over coffee suppliers. They are "everywhere" which goes a long way. Also, in my apartment I am limited on counter space and shelf space so I (can only speak for myself) wouldn't buy a coffee bean grinder and then also have a coffee maker.
Economic collapse... Edgy.
>The first problem was the need for water sanitation. Most of the groups they were targeting ‚Äì especially in Africa ‚Äì didn‚Äôt have access to clean water (many don‚Äôt to this day), so it was necessary for them to boil the water. But due to low literacy rates, many mothers were not aware of this, so they mixed the formula with polluted water which put the children at great risks. **Nestle seems to have knowingly ignored this and encouraged** mothers to use the formula even when they knew the risks.

this was his source, he didn't read it too carefully and for some reason has a hard on for nestle. The article he links completely shits on nestle, plus the author only has qualifications in geophysics, so the article wasn't the best choice.
Back in the 1970s, some activists who hated the idea of baby formula, and worshiped the nature goddess perfection of breast milk, attacked companies who manufactured baby formula and sold it to 3rd world countries. Specifically, they were mad that formula was seen as more civilized, upscale, advanced, and western versus breast milk. They claimed that saleswomen (not necessarily employees) would dress as nurses and solicit new mothers in hospitals, trying to get them to switch to formula sooner than around 6 months (when they admit switching would be okay). They claimed that formula was bad, so it was causing more babies to die. Nestle sued them for defamation and won in court.
Since then, the conspiracy theorists have taken it to crazytown levels, claiming that Nestle engaged in a diabolical plot to mass murder babies by tricking dirt poor mothers into switching to formula with "free samples" so that their natural breast milk would dry up, and then once the milk was dry, jack up the prices so much that the mothers couldn't afford it and their babies would starve and die, and that this killed millions of babies per year.

http://www.zmescience.com/science/nestle-company-pollution-children/

There's the argument against Nestle.

Lots of bullshit in that article:
- Nestle didn't "aggressively" push formula in 3rd world countries.

-Nestle did not TARGET the poor. Why would they? Poor people can't afford to buy their shit.

-The ad posted is American, and flat out says Mother's milk is, of course, the best food for young babies.

-It is absolutely 100% true that Doctors said that by 6 months, mothers need to add more nutrition than just breast milk. Nestle's ad says this flat out.

-There is no evidence that Nestle was pushing formula on people so poor that they didn't have clean water (pretty much everyone in cities has clean water, if they didn't, they would die).

-You don't need to be literate to know not to give babies dirty water. That same water would not be healthy for the mother, either.

-The 2007 save the children report says the same shit as Nestle's own ad: breast feed till 6 months, then add formula and other foods after that.

-Studies of formula use in 3rd world countries showed that the vast majority of buyers bought it because they were unable to produce their own milk. In other words, it was formula or starvation for their babies. Nestle saved lives.

-How the fuck was Nestle supposed to be pimping out formula to mothers who just gave birth when Nestle clearly says not to start formula until after 6 months? Nestle tried to investigate these claims and could not substantiate them.
Well, breathable air is a foodstuff and should have a market value.
Careful. Most people on this site have absolutely no clue about economics or scarcity and just want to feign outrage. 
More like "restrict the common man's access to cheap water, except through us."  
Plz stop, it's hard to rage when you bring facts and reason here
Which appears to be mostly about pricing the common man out of easy access to water, excepting through them.
Are you saying Nestle is not buying/pumping water from the public water source and reselling it in bottles to the public at profit? Because that is wrong. 

http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article19559868.html

Groundwater can also take decades to replenish in some areas like the Central Valley of CA. The ground itself has sunk several feet due to water pumping. Edit: im not saying nestle is responsible for this, im saying its a problem and plays into the next point.

In California there is not plenty of groundwater to pump. Not after the last drought, which for whatever reason officials declared ‚Äúover‚Äù, though reservoirs in my area have gotten quite low again. It seems like a shortsighted to me. 

You say:

>	Pumping water for human consumption is one of the least impactful uses for water that happens. 

Then you say to go after agriculture... news flash, pumping water for agriculture is technically water for human consumption and a disproportionally *huge* amount of produce comes from CA. 
In fact, Nestle donated around 2 million bottles of water to Flint, but I always enjoy the anti-corporate narrative on reddit. Nestle is smart to get ahead of the game on this, though. At some point, potable water is going to become a huge commodity. Not so much in the US, but look at what is happening in [Cape Town](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/cape-town-running-out-of-water-drought-taps-shutoff-other-cities/?beta=true). 
Nestle and Flint problems are different.

Alright, got it
Starbuck's coffee tastes like burnt dog droppings.  That's not coffee either.
Meh.  It's what I would consider the best drive-thru coffee.  It doesn't hold a candle to some mom and pop shops, but on the go, it beats Starbucks, McDonald's, and BK.
Still tastes better than Starbucks
Was, there was a time recently where Starbucks has been bleeding employee left and right they are currently trying hard to replace them. On the other hand they also rolling out button pushers to replace their baristas.
Let's leave Tiffany and De Beers out of this.

Well I guess 100% of all companies fail eventually, gotta make he most of it
Except Starbucks is a large enough company that "Investors" is most Americans. Mutual funds and ETFs own loads of Starbucks stock. This isn't some shadowy group forcing Starbucks to favor profits over people. 

This is the American economy working as designed.
At which point they'll create a new company, with a new name and a new logo and start from scratch, touting all the same things that made them popular in the beginning. 
> This isn't the fault of some nebulous group of "investors". We did this. This is America. This is the form American consumerism has taken and the cost to be paid for it all in one.

Either you file for bankruptcy, or exist long enough to see yourself become the monopoly. 
Makes you think if America is really free or are you just being sold stuff you don't really need. You might not be ruled by the government but you are to your corporations 
This is a strange metaphor to use but I guess it checks out....
Thank you for being the first logical response I have received so far.
Starbucks isn't acting like they are in MCD's space, nor are they in a race to the bottom, and nor are they trying to transition to the McMarket. MCD is attempting to steal starbucks' customers. This deal involves no points that you're trying to make. Without going to far (because this topic doesn't warrant that) let me give you another example. Do you think WMT produces all of great value's products? No, they don't. They hire private labels/other brands/manufactures to do that for them. Starbucks and nestle are the same situation. You would be surprised the private label business that goes on behind the scenes, which clearly you aren't aware of. The next product you buy look on the back and see what it says. Does it say "Manufactured By (insert company)" or "Manufactured for (insert company)" and that will explain this discussion that I was trying to present to you : )
They're too focused on driving growth, which, to be fair, is getting rather difficult these days. Any standalone Starbucks by nature gets built in areas with high foot traffic and/or automobile traffic, in order to maximize potential profit. The problem is, they have to deal with advertising themselves as a [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) towards customers AND partners (their term for employees) while balancing their need to increase profit and add more locations to keep up with changing demographics.

For example, my drive thru store is in the top ten in terms of average sales volume thanks to its location(teachers and students from 9 schools, 2 colleges, NSA employees & contractors, and DC drivers are most of our regulars), and as a result, we're the ones training any partners who will be working at a new drive thru location.

Their expansion, however, dilutes the brand - we've got to train more and more baristas that then go work at new locations, without adequate time to iron out any bad habits they develop, all of which drops our sales and makes our own store slower and more prone to error. 

 As for China, we haven't had a lot of news on that end. Things could go either way, depending on how corporate approaches it.
If it was stagnating with no growth, I'd be worried.  Knowing that they are breaking into the Chinese market has me optimistic.  I'll sit and be happy with the dividend now with hopes that the Chinese market will pay off in the long run.

What worries me most is that they keep adding to their menu.  McDonalds did that, and for a long while they were really struggling.  I think companies should stick to their core offering.  McDonalds started offering wings and pizza and all kinds of crazy shit, and their profits plummited.  Go back to just a few burgers, fries, soda, and milkshakes.  Starbucks is the same... make coffee drinks.  Stop it with all of the sandwiches and BBQ and wine and, and, and....  

I'm hoping their Chinese investment pays off.  If it doesn't show improvement in a year or two, it'll be time to reconsider.
I would wonder whether the turnover issue was a generalized fast casual dining industry trend, or specific to Starbucks. It would be interesting to see some numbers.

My take on Starbucks pivoting from an HR perspective (my wife works in corporate fast casual HR): It's more culture shift and Starbucks reacting to it than anything else. The job market at large has changed over the last 3 years. Millennial employee perception of the value of tenure at a single job might be a factor. I think it is. A large number of fast casual dining employees are Millenials and even Gen Z now.

Churn is an entirely different statistic that tells the restaurant/store how may customers their pushing through each day, and that's certainly gone up in the last 3-5 years at Starbucks as well, and has had an impact on customer experience and how they approach their business as well.
*is typing...*
Thanks for your thoughts. I am apparently way disconnected from what many Americans are thinking when they walk into a Starbucks and plunk down so much money for something, that, for me at least, is a breakfast drink. I know that you will have space in your home and your budget someday really soon to enjoy a super good coffee in the morning and walk right on past the local Starbucks. Cheers!
Not so much. I'm guessing people will start thinking more about their money. Go ahead and shit all over me but at some point the general public will realize they can do without a $10 coffee and scone they can have at home for $1.50.
Yum, air!

Oh whoa they donated a whole 2 million! That's like 250,000 gallons!
>Nestle donated around 2 million bottles of water to Flint, but I always enjoy the anti-corporate narrative on reddit.

That's cool. Doesn't forgive all the people they've killed.
yes, it is. You might not think its good coffee, but its made on an espresso machine out of water and coffee beans. So yes, its coffee. Tims powder and hot water machine is not. 
Sounds like we need a new design, one that isn't designed to feed on itself.
Simple, the "shadowy" but powerful group of minority hedge fund investors force Starbucks to behave in this unsustainable fashion to drive up the stock price, sells high, makes a boat load of money, and gets out at the nick of time while the average mutual fund owning investor is left holding the bag.

I do believe this is exactly how the American economy is working at the moment.
I'm interested in why you think expansion dilutes the brand. I'm not convinced Starbucks' brand is losing value, but I do think Starbucks coffee brand value has peaked. 

It's a natural step for a business in that position to expand further into other product lines. Teavana, pushing juice and cream based frappucinnos vs. traditional espresso drinks and coffee, adding significantly more new prepared and packaged food items in recent years than in past years.  

To me, for the American business, it just looks like Starbucks is looking for other markets to associate their brand with, and those markets are either in retail or aren't coffee.
Oh no it's Hillary Clin
Personally, I don't see it, and I suspect Starbucks would adapt if something like that happened, but unlike, "Americans will not have pocket change for gourmet coffee", there's at least some possibility of, "Americans will decide not to waste their money on over priced coffee". You're also pretty out of touch with pricing if you think it costs $10 for a coffee there, as a normal medium coffee is $2.10, and the reason people often get it there as opposed to home is because they're on the go or want to sit in a cafe outside of their home.
How much free stuff does a company have to give a way for you to be happy?
I will grant you that the espresso is espresso at Starbucks, quality is for a later debate.  Still, the coffee proper tastes much better from Timmies.
Relevant username. Relevant comment. Pull up a chair. Somebody get this person a beer.
The hedge fund managers and the mutual fund managers are the same people. They have different mandates in each of those positions but at the end of the day their job is to get the highest return they can while following the law and that mandate.

Everybody wins and loses together. It just matters a lot less for the wealthy when they lose. He average investor feels like they're holding the bag because their loss has tangible effects on their lifestyle. They engaged with the system because in America that's what you do. You chase aspirational wealth and pull on your bootstraps as goddamn hard as humanly possible.

Casting the games players as heroes and villains doesn't change the game and never will. It's psychological masturbation it feels good.

If we really want the game to change we need to change the rules (create additional and protect existing regulation like the CFPB). That or we need to start playing a different fucking game.
Oh no, I'm not brave enough for polit
Free stuff coming from the water permits they hold to sell back the water to the public as a commercial entity. My local grocery store could donate more than 250,000 gallons of water and they routinely purchase more than 250,000 gallons of water at cost.
It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre giving away a highly engineered good that is helping out the cause.
They‚Äôre giving away water that they claimed is theirs and usually charge people for. Not exactly pushing the envelope in terms of developing goods.
I never went back after watching my latte come out of a machine so I never tried the drop coffee there. That said, if you get a nice coffee blend at Starbucks like the French Roast and have it done as a pour over its pretty good. 
Everyone in Michigan gets free water. Much of the state's residents have well water and just draw it up out of the ground for free. Those connected to water utilities aren't actually paying anything for the water itself, that has zero cost basis, they're paying for the infrastructure and employees to treat and pump the water to them. 

I don't think people understand just how obnoxiously plentiful water is in a place like Michigan. The state has regular flooding issues. It falls from the heavens all the time. Environmental analysis shows Nestle's paltry draw won't have any meaningful impact on the local water table, 400 GPM doesn't even register as a creek in a state filled with thousands.

They're giving away water they bought the rights to, extracted, processed, packaged, and delivered. None of that was free, but the donation was. They didn't donate a highly processed product because the city screwed up their water supply and needed water. I guess they could have sent pizzas.
They actually do that?  My biggest issue with them is I am sugar sensitive, so I taste even residuals.  I ask them for a new stir stick for my coffee when they mix my cream, and lo and behold, they just rinsed off their old one a little and I taste the sugar.  6 different Starbucks, all have sugar in it.
And what are the quality of those wells? My town still has wells but very few would drink it due to the industries(old and current) near by. I understand what quarterly payments are used for but the infrastructure actually has to be in place, otherwise like my town you pay for sewers that were promised to be completed ten years ago. 

Your latter paragraph is confusing I don't see how regular flood issues equates to plentiful drinking water.

If you want to go crazier that 250,000 gallons donated if they come in the standard pallet size of 40 then nestle only donated 6250 pallets of water or 3800 barrels of water. I'm sure Budweiser In-Bev easily move more than that a week so to act like Nestle did something generous is simply people not understand math and volume.
You clearly are not a native Michigander.


Nobody gets "free water," and the claim is being made in way so as to conflate Nestle paying pennies per hundreds of gallons compared to Michiganders living off of wells. Wells are not free. They require permits and range between $6K-$10K per well in the lower peninsula. I, as a suburb dweller, am not allowed to drill for water. Lots of people aren't because Michigan generally fiercely protects its water tables. The thing happening in California where industry sucks water out of the ground and causes the land to sink several feet as it depletes aquifers irresponsibly? [Happening in Michigan, too.](http://www.mlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2013/10/water_water_everywhere_in_mich.html)


Native Michiganders will know all about the [Great Lakes Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Compact) which strictly enforces who can draw water from the Great Lakes, and how much. Outsiders, like yourself, will miss something important that Michigan has taken very seriously until the Snyder administration: giving companies like Nestle the rights to extract millions of gallons a year, all for a $200 DEQ permit fee, is a loophole to avoid the Compact. It lets Nestle, a non-Michigan company, to export water from the Great Lakes region, anywhere it wants. The Compact is the reason that California can't tap our water sources. But Nestle can, then deliver the water at a huge profit considering their low, almost non-existent, costs.


>I don't think people understand just how obnoxiously plentiful water is in a place like Michigan. The state has regular flooding issues. It falls from the heavens all the time. Environmental analysis shows Nestle's paltry draw won't have any meaningful impact on the local water table, 400 GPM doesn't even register as a creek in a state filled with thousands.

Michigan's flooding problems are largely due to snow, and aren't a regular problem across the state. California has regular flooding issues; should Nestle pump a ridiculous amount of groundwater from that state? 

Who completed the analysis? Michiganders have a right to be skeptical when it comes to our greatest natural resource. Flint, after all, was covered up by the DEQ and Michigan state government. DEQ also covered up a massive algae bloom in the aquifer sitting under Ann Arbor. 

[DEQ also covered up a massive PFAS water poisoning that is still unfolding.](http://michiganradio.org/post/report-deq-emails-show-cozy-relationship-wolverine-delayed-warnings-about-contaminated-water)


Sensing a trend? Individuals lose under the Snyder administration's DEQ. Companies like Nestle always seem to come out ahead. This is important for many reasons, but let me leave you just one: our water is being poisoned by companies like Nestle, who are then over-extracting from the good water sources so they can sell clean water to people who now have poisoned ground water that causes cancers.


It‚Äôs water. For everyone. Whom sells those rights? 
I drink mine black so I have no idea what they stir the cream and that with, but if you are happy with tims then just keep with it. If you get stuck without a tims try the Starbucks pour over! 
And then everyone on the internet got mad and nothing was done about it.
The town itself should pass a law to conserve water, like other towns conserve water. All over the US towns are passing laws to conserve water, and regulating that water consumption during times of drought.
>The permits allow municipalities, mining companies and golf courses ‚Äî in addition to the water-bottlers ‚Äî to take a total of **1.4 trillion litres** out of Ontario‚Äôs surface and ground water supplies every day.

Of which Nestle's 20 million litres that are for drinking water. That's a ratio 700,000:1.


They have no issue putting another tax on fuel but leave the cost of taking water artificially low, guess they only care about the environment when it works with their talking points.
If only there was an organization that could prevent these kinds of things with rules that everybody has to follow.
Water?  Like from the toilet?
1. The local government granted the permit in the first place. Vote them out of office. Nestle can't buy things you don't try to sell.

2. Nestle's take of water is almost nothing compared to the awesome quantities of the stuff that agriculture uses, especially in places like California. If you're trying to improve a situation like that, it's usually best to target the biggest item since even a 1% change will have a huge impact. But we don't.
Im not surprised. A quick google search and you can find a video of their CEO saying people dont have the right to water....
Activists really need to be more knowledgeable about what they put energy into.  Stop bottling water because it is a waste of plastic, not because it wastes water. BTW there is no reuse, repurpose, recycle of plastic bottles that is equal the environmental impact of not using bottled water in the first place. 
Take a look at the Nature Conservancy of Canada.

Coca Cola is a top supporter of their water stewardship programs. Nestle and Coca Cola are business partners.

The only reason they want to conserve water is because it's their product. Face it - our water is being privatized.

EDIT: If you believe Coca Cola just does good things, you're in the corporate friend zone.
That's okay, the villagers can buy it back of course
As a Canadian I find it insane that in some parts of the US it is illegal to collect rainwater yet Nestl√© can take water during a drought and sell it.  When I start talking about Monsanto or corn products or companies like Nestl√© people think I'm crazy.  But people are not paying enough attention.  By the time they do ...
Do people not understand your water bill is for waste water disposal and treatment ?
During a drought, they want to shut off the one use of water that's exclusively for drinking. By humans.
Why are nestle still enabled to be such massive cunts? They're like the evil corporation in a late 80s action thriller - almost doesn't seem real any more.
I kindly ask everybody to consider boycotting everything Nestl√©. I have been doing so for the past year because I feel like that's all I can do by myself, which may not be true, but it's still something!
Nestle CEO says humans aren't born with an inherent right to water.. what do ya expect? Stop buying Nestle and subsidiary products or get used to it.  
  
Edit: wish I would have seen how this looked earlier before Nestle damage control showed up.   
I meant that all these companies are getting away with shit like this because we *are* still voting with our dollars. This is my straw, even if I'm not a camel.  
Think my metaphors are getting a little tangled
Since when did Nestle become synonymous with Evil? I swear they have a worse reputation now than McDonalds.
The CEO of nestle wants to own your water. Watch the youtube video.
>Nestle Waters Canada says it‚Äôs committed to ‚Äúa continued engagement with the community‚Äù while it waits for the decision on its renewal application in Aberfoyle, where it operates a water-bottling plant.

Engagement with the community as in selling the water to them, you mean?
I've been boycotting Nestle for a while now. Its hard. They have so many major [frozen] pizza brands in my area under their belt. 
Same kind of thing in India...during drought in State of Maharashtra, branded water bottles, water pouch was easily available but not free water...
The city York, the old one in the north of England (I.e the original 'NewYork') is another example of suffering caused by Nestle's ruthlessly efficient business model. Back in the 1800s a Quaker named Joseph Rowntree wanted to give the poor people of York some non-sinful pleasure in their wretched lives, so decided to build a chocolate factory. It offered decent jobs and was a great success. 

As a possibly interesting aside, an enterprising American visited York in the early 1900s to find out about Joseph's way of making chocolate.  Unfortunately something important was lost in translation (to do with the tempering temperature for chocolate, I think) and that is why Hershey's chocolate doesn't taste quite right - to me at least.

Back to the story: a childhood trip to Ireland during the potato famine gave Joseph some awareness of poverty, suffering, wasted lives and death. He built a whole village for his factory workers to live with decent houses and a good school for families to send their kids. Best of all his factory invented and produced many of the classics: KitKats, Yorkies, Smarties, Quality Streets, Areos and many many more. 

Success continued and York became a prosperous and happy place, until Thatcher came to power. Everyone remembers Britain's first female Prime Minister for her bloody wars  against the miners in nearby Yorkshire towns throughout the 80s. This has meant that Nestle's hostile takeover of Rowntree's chocolate factory is easily forgotten. But we should all be appalled by this - fans of free market capitalism included. The takeover broke rules designed to prevent monopolies, but she forced it through despite a bitter protest from the city. That my friends is neoliberalism for you: profit at any expense. 

Nestle has continued its growth and you've seen they still do what they do. On the other hand, Joseph Rowntree's name (and considerable fortune) now manifests as the JR Foundation. These days they produce high quality social research on poverty in the UK and try to influence government policy on things like the welfare state, low wages, and in-work poverty - the latter is extremely high in the UK the former stagnant or diminishing.  

For reasons I'm at a loss to explain, there is still no statue of Joseph Rowntree in York.
Man, here's a thought: if you don't want Nestle or some other company taking your water, *stop selling them water rights.*
This is fucking stupid. Drinking water is an infinitesimally small fraction of water usage, this is orders of magnitude away from making a difference.

It's like standing between a coal power plant and a 6 lane highway full of idling diesel trucks and yelling at a guy standing down the road vaping for polluting the atmosphere with his second hand smoke.

If we can all stop buying Nestl√© products that'd be great.
I've been avoiding Nestle products for years because they're such a piece of shit company, and even with this kind of thing happening if I bring up my opinion of the company someone always asks what's wrong with Nestle.
At least that water will be used for drinking.
wish i could do something but i'm still boycotting them from the babymilk thing... 
Consumers continue to buy Nestle products, despite sociopathic behavior: me

In case you care enough to stop doing this, here is a list of products that this company produces.

People collectively understand and accept how terrible Walmart is but they aren't going anywhere as long as you're paying them. It's not like theses companies just sprung up and suddenly started accumulating wealth from nowhere. Your dollar is your vote and it looks like we overwhelmingly want them to stick around. 
They own Poland springs :(
Nestle doesn't care about people's well-being. They sold non milk products as milk in Africa in order to cut cost and put out of business local milk companies that actually produce milk. A case was brought to court in Cameroun and they found Nestle guilty.The company just bribed the gov't and the case thrown away. 200 people lost their jobs and the owner closed his company without receiving any compensation for the loss he made due to fraudulent marketing from Nestle.
You also have one of their guys wanting to privatize water. 
They don't care if water gets short,they are too busy maximizing their profits and dressing their salespeople as nurses.
What do you expect from a company that doesn't believe water is a basic human right.


edit:contractions
The only reason bottled water is commercially viable for anybody is all the idiots that actually buy water when their municipal or well water is as good or better that any bottled water.
To those saying "they have a permit," please note that they are extracting water from one California town even though the permit EXPIRED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
Don't buy nestle, it's as simple as that.
To borrow from John Waters, if you go home with someone, and they have Nestle products, don't fuck them. 

I promise you cultural change, if we all agree to those terms. 
i think people here need to realize how little water Nestle is actually using/selling.

it's like .000001% of what golf courses or swimming pools uses.


PSA: Pellegrino is made by Nestle. Friend cued me into this so I stopped drinking those delicious little sugar sloshes last year. Thanks friend I don't remember the name of!
If you can find a documentary called Bottle Life, watch it! It shows how shitty Nestle is. 
well their biggest cash cow is selling bottled water even with all the candy and breakfast candy they produce, water is their main income, water you can get from the tab in most of the west.
I'm not surprised, I mean have you seen the leaked video of Nestle's last board meeting?

Just checked the article and this is my town, whoo!

I read an article two days ago about how the city is planning to open several new municipal wells because we don't have enough water for everyone and I thought to myself, doesn't Nestle extract water from our source?  Could we just cut them back?'. Guess not.
What do you mean a corporation is taking advantage of their contract? *GASP AND SHOCK*
"$3,000 for those considered a high risk to cause an adverse environmental impact."

That's all it costs to have an adverse impact on the environment? Shouldn't it be illegal as opposed to for sale?
It is the government not Nestle at fault. They should have never been granted the license in the first place. 
Are they paying for it? Yes? Then jack up the prices?
I remember watching a thing on people in china buying air from canada. People laughed at it was ludicrous. But were not better when you buy bottled water

N-E-S-T-L-E-S...Nestle steals the very best...WATER.
Yeah Nestle kind of does this in numerous places, they have a bottling plant here in fucking Phoenix, Arizona as well. The middle of a goddamn desert.
ITT people who dont know or understand water laws.
Same thing happening in Cabazon, California and 11 other places in California.  Nestle is taking 400 millions gallon of water per year from the Morongo Indian Reservation when the Governor declared a drought and ordered water restrictions.  The whole scam stinks to high heaven and not one California politician gives a fuck.    
Ontario is run by the most corrupt self serving incompetant provincial government we have ever had. I am not suprised.
Seriously if everyone stopped buying coffemate and other dipshit Nestle products the world would be a better place.

Sad to see a giant Nestle Coffeemate plant sucking up the aquifer in the middle of Indiana to make their bullshit product.
This company is hard to boycott but I'm doing my best.
And I continue to not buy Nestle's products. Is there anything more I can do?
Here's a suggestion, instead of bitching on Reddit about how terrible this is (its really bad and very illegal) stop buying bottled water. Corporations listen to sales, not Reddit comments.
Isn't the CEO of Nestle some lunatic who believes water isn't a right and that we should charge people for access to reservoirs? 
Does anyone here know that it is Nestle's goal to CORNER the WORLDS water market? so this is pardon the pun..the proverbial drop in the bucket
I'm not hoping for it, but sooner or later the people are going to burn Nestle to the ground. 
Fuck. Nestle. Those motherfuckers want to own the rain.
what can people from this area do to stop them? can someone show up @ the well & cap it, especially since their permit has expired? with extensive public disapproval and display of this disapproval i'm sure the local government will cave to the will of the people. this summer has been EXTREMELY arid in ontario up until this month. and quite frankly, fuck nestle for doing all this unethical water bottling worldwide, didn't they just pull this shit recently in california?
They are also doing this in [California](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20160626/new-arguments-added-to-case-over-nestles-water-permit-in-san-bernardino-mountains)
Focus on the Evil nestle corporation.  Boogabooga!

Ignore big ag who is pumping out magnitudes more water, to the point the ground is collapsing. 
They're doing the same thing here in Lake Arrowhead. It was discovered about a year and a half ago that they were taking water on an expired permit and paying less than $600/yr.
For anyone who wants to show their support by boycotting Nestle; don't buy 16oz bottle water or gallon jugs. Nestle has a near monopoly on any bottled water product. If you want Nestle to lose revenue, even nominally, get a water purifier for your faucet and get a refillable bottle. 
Why is Nestle taking water from a place with drought? Wouldn't it be easier to take water from any place else??
All I can say is the liberals are a blight to both Ontario and Canada. Hopefully people see that are vote them out next go round.
Back in the 80's, if somebody told me that in the future there would be drastic droughts and the people would have to buy their own water resources back from Nestl√©, in plastic bottles, I'd have never believed it.  God bless America.
Wouldn't it make more sense for this to say....

Activists: Nestl√© continues to....

Or was it intentional to avoid that as the first word?  The way it is written does not make sense to me.
why the fuck do people need bottle water anyways? just buy a plastic bottle at walmart. reuse that shit.
Obviously Nestle will cite some contract and the fact that they paid as a legal excuse for this. But why. Why be so crude. I guess they are desperate and money is tight. 
I recently did choose another brand of bottled water, deliberately because of Nestle's poor corporate citizenship.  I will continue to choose otherwise until thier practices change.
That's what happens when you sign the rights for your water away. You don't have the rights to the water...

If you really want to stop Nestle from doing this horrible shit, let your local governments know that they should say fuck you to Nestle and take back their water supply. 
As usual, the outrage should be towards the government

Nestle bought the fkn water place, its theirs, like it or not. You're mad because it's unethical? Don't privatize it in the first place. Nestl√© did nothing wrong, government did. 

Why would Nestl√© or any private company care for the general public interest? Not their fucking problem.

why would nestle be to blame since what they are doing is fully legal? 

Same with BP sinking all the oil instead of cleaning it, the law allows bp to sink the oil, so since its the cheapest option they do it.

It seems like nestle is working within the laws of Ontario and if anything needs to be done, it would be to change the laws the ministry is following. 
"The permits allow municipalities, mining companies and golf courses ‚Äî in addition to the water-bottlers ‚Äî to take a total of 1.4 trillion litres out of Ontario‚Äôs surface and ground water supplies every day."

Mining companies and FUCKING GOLF COURSES? But no... no let's light our hair on fire about Nestle taking 1 millionth of the water...
As an Ontarian this article pisses me right off, but in no way surprises me. What I think we should note however is all this BS would solve itself if people stopped buying bottles water. Seriously people, it takes several gallons of water to make one bottle of water. Produced by companies with far less oversight than municipal water suppliers. Supporting this makes no sense.
Well, considering the CEO of Nestle went on record saying he doesn't believe that water is a basic human right, I'm not surprised.
And them taking water from an aquifer with hundreds of trillions of liters of water isn't going to change the fact that they're having a drought.  Until the rivers dry up, the aquifers aren't going to start draining.

This is literally people bitching about nothing for the sake of bitching.

It would be a little different if they were draining lakes with their reckless practices.
People keep buying it.   They have been bleeding California dry for a long time,  even on expired permits. 
I'm sure its been said a bunch in this post but.... FUCK Nestl√©. Damn corporate turds.
That sounds like something a business would do. How awful. Save the rage for your politicians. Nestl√© doesn't give a shit about teary-eyed activists. There's a buck to be made and they'll walk over corpses to get it.
When are morality laws going to be initialized? When are we actually going to stop the greed so our children have a home?

We need change. Not Obama change. Real fucking change.

I do my very fucking best to avoid purchasing Nestle products. I'm not one to boycott companies but bottled water is bottled fucking water. Chocolate is chocolate. If everyone hears this shit, maybe they'll do the same, and Nestle will suffer.
Well for anyone who cares enough to want to do something about this, a local activist group called  [Save Our Water](http://www.saveourwater.ca/) formed as a response to Nestle extracting water from the well mentioned in the article. So if you'd like to channel your rage against Nestle into something positive, get involved or donate :) 
Stop buying their products, it's not the hardest thing in the world to do. Use this info-graphic for reference. I personally didn't even use most of those products before I decided to boycott them. https://unlatched.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/580289_480285708677755_1459649519_n.jpg

The day the consumers of this world understand the power they hold, revolution will come to the market. Your standard corporation exists solely to reap profit. Destroy their margin of profit and you increase your buying power, which ultimately results in empowering the consumer base. It's actually that simple, but the hardest part is getting people do understand that fact. Like they say, "common sense isn't so common"
Because our elected officials are wealth submissive, and do not care what we think. 
Slacktivist: saving the world one sentence at a time. 
I live in the city that uses this well as one of its sources of water. These are the restrictions currently in effect (and have been for about 2 months now).

* Lawn watering is not permitted
* Watering decorative (e.g. flower) gardens ‚Äì Alternate day and time restrictions (odd numbered address, odd numbered calendar day, even numbered address, even numbered calendar day, between 7 and 9 a.m. and 7 and 9 p.m.)
* At home vehicle washing ‚Äì At‚Äìhome vehicle washing (cars, boats, trailers, etc.) is not permitted
* Watering trees and food gardens ‚Äì no restrictions
* Recreational sprinklers for children, splash pads ‚Äì no restrictions
* Filling residential swimming and wading pools, hot tubs, garden ponds or fountains ‚Äì no restrictions
* Decorative fountains ‚Äì must recirculate water
Too bad if the TPP goes through that won't matter.
So these people conserve water by not using their taps as much, but they are still going to Walmart and buying skids of Nestle bottled water. Nestle isn't stealing the local water to ship to Saudi Arabia or something. The water is to feed local demand.
This is really blown out of proportion. This is the first real drought Ontario has had in years, and water conservation efforts at this point are pretty much precautionary. It's not until you have multi year droughts like in California that it becomes an issue. Furthermore, in Ontario we don't even have the issue of agricultural irrigation. Hardly anyone in this province irrigates because typically it rains enough. Nobody is anywhere close to running out of water at this point. Also I just moved from Guelph 2 months ago, which is the major city 10 minutes north of this town. People pee their pants about this nestle plant every frigging year over essentially nothing because they hate nestle. 
Right  -but

>>Ontario charges companies just $3.71 for every million litres of water, 

That seems to be the way to control this, if people object.
[deleted]
Yep. Nestle is one of the tiniest villians here.
[deleted]
Really?  You think that's an honest comparison?...

Because you're comparing the **total water used in all of Ontario, including what's used by municipalities,** to the millions of liters of water that Nestle is taking out of a small, drought-ridden area.

What are you? A dirty communist?
I've never seen a plant grow out of the toilet!
Yeah I don't really get why bottled water is frequently the target of outrage in drought-ridden areas. It accounts for an essentially negligible proportion of total water use.
lmao you think its that easy to get these idiots out of our office? with all the old people still around that'll be tough to do
There is demand for it.

If you want to stop water from being bottled, you have to stop people from wanting to *buy* bottled water.

And you also have to explain why bottled water with flavoring is okay (e.g. most every soft drink).
Waste of plastic isn't the issue, you can recycle it, and even though recycling wastes energy, transporting bottled water all over the world wastes much more and is the real problem.
"Coca Cola does good things therefore those good things must be bad" - wgriz, current year.
They did good things in exchange of good publicity and cooperate images, that's how the world goes. 
That scares me.
No one does anything just for the sake of doing it--just for the sake of "being nice". If I buy a girl a drink because I want her attention because I think she's pretty, does that make me a bad person? If Burton Snowboards gives lots of money to environmental protection charities, does that make them a bad company? This mentality that something is only a "good" act if it is done with no additional motive has always made me chuckle.

As a Canadian, I had to laugh heartily at this.  Just so naive it's insane...  Someone's been reading a few too many blogs.

Probably since they gave new mothers in Africa free infant formula, then jacked the prices up after the women stopped lactating and being able to feed their babies on their own.

The women had no choice but to water the expensive formula down, and a bunch of kids died.

So, definitely since at least then.
The water issues are mostly, but not entirely, overblown, but their formula scam was nothing less than literal child murder.  

Also, McDonald's isn't really that evil at all.  They make safe and consistent food that's available everywhere.  They have nutritional information right there on the menu board.  As their business declines, there have been allegations that they're not playing fair with franchisors, but declining businesses are a no win situation for everyone involved.  
Decades ago. They didn't get this hideous reputation overnight.
Water, that infant formula thing, and slavery

I don't buy Nestle products if I can help it. Textbook evil megacorp.
> Drinking water is an infinitesimally small fraction of water usage, this is orders of magnitude away from making a difference.

We're talking about the township of Puslinch, with a population of 7,000 people.  Nestle is taking 20 million liters of water a day.

They ARE the coal plant.
Also, people in the region are going to buy bottled water regardless of drought or not. Probably even more during a drought. What is Nestle supposed to do? Not sell bottled water? Ship bottled water in from hundreds/thousands of miles away? Of course it makes sense to bottle local water if possible.
The difference here is that they aren't bottling it to sell locally.
http://www.ethicsdaily.com/how-your-plastic-water-bottles-hurt-the-planet-cms-20681
Sure.  We can pay 300x more for bottled water than tap water, all to avoid some "wasted" water.

~~But you know that "wasted" water goes back into the watershed, right?~~ (Edit: most doesn't, at least not in useable form.)

Instead of paying 300x the price for our water, how about we just fix our infrastructure?  We could pay for it by actually charging companies like Nestle a reasonable price for the water they're taking...
Bottling water *reserves it for drinking*, and moves it to places where people can do so conveniently.  Isn't that kinda the most fundamental and least wasteful use for water we have?
Leave it to Reddit to down vote an expert providing good information.
This is a good point.. Making the best out of a shitty situation. At least golf courses aren't sucking the rivers dry. 
While this is thought of as universal fact, it is untrue, at least in my area of the country. Company filtering methods are far more effective. 
>EXPIRED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

and as clearly allowed in the permit they applied to renew the permit some 27 years ago. As long as they continue to pay the annual fee every year they can continue to pull water. The state never took action on the renewal. Nestlee did nothing illegal.

If you want to get your kinckers in a wad look into how much water California paper mills consume to produce paper. They have 46 paper mills in CA.    


As an example the Tacoma, Wa paper mill uses 45 million gallons pr day.  So 1 mill = 16,000 million gallons annual vs Nestlee 20 million gal.


But they'll still fuck each other. What now?
The old conundrum: who's to blame, the buyers or the sellers?

Damn I'm thirsty everytime I watch that film. I think ill go watch that film. 
And the amount of water they are taking here in Phoenix is so minuscule it has zero affect on anything. 
THIS. it's a fucking waste anyways. Buy a re-usable bottle/s , get a filter and get your water that way. You will save money over the long term and not create more waste in the world.
Former and no, his words have been twisted on Reddit in such a ridiculous way.
Deprive him of water for a few days.  I bet he changes his tune pretty damn quick.
Water isn't a right. Show me where it says that in any country's constitution.

I hate them. But they are smart. They know fresh water will be hard to come by in the future.

If you want to start trying to make up shit, look into agriculture and other water usages California has a problem with.  If you want to try to say something about agriculture being better than Nestle look into what they produce and how much water it uses to grow that crop.  Then realize these products are not as needed as you may think and then look into wastefulness of modern irrigation.
Did you read the article? It says farmers only take 0.5% of the 1.4 trillion litres daily.
Fuck ag and nestl√©.

 Drought would be overstating it. While July and the first couple weeks of August have been dry, there has been a deluge over the past week or so. The Speed and Eramosa Rivers are running high.

 As to why they take water from Aberfoyle, it's been doing so for decades. The area has a reputation for water quality.
Its best to look into the actual numbers before demonizing them.

I haven't looked into this particular case's numbers, but as a comparison, Nestle was pulling water from California despite California's drought. There was a lot of negative press and calls for bans of Nestle products.

Nestle's stated (in 2014) that they were using 700 million gallons of California's water per year. It sounds like a lot, but is not that much compared to California's total water usage which is (USGS numbers in 2010, which is the most recent) of 38 **billion** gallons of water **per day**.

Their total water usage is largely insignificant to the problems that California is facing.
Because there is no fucking drought here!!! This is aberfoyle which is an hour west of Toronto. If there is a drought here then there is one in Toronto too, and I sure as fuck haven't heard of any drought there. Wellington Water Warchers is nothing but a fringe environmental group who likes to fight the big bad corporations. 
Because tap water tastes like crap here

We have morality laws, drugs and prostitution are illegal... Isn't that all that matters?
wont somebody PLEASE think of the children!!
A right is just the things that we collectively decide are necessary for people to have in a civilised society. To say that you don't think water should be a right is to say that you are fine with people dying because of lack of clean water. That kind of sentiment would have been acceptable for most of human history. It's not okay any more. We have advanced.
That statement seems so clear when you think about poor kids drinking contaminated water. But it gets funky when you read about California's water rights history, and the weird pricing subsidies granted to farmers. Good for avocado eaters, but iffy in times of drought. What the layman thinks of a "right" ends up being the tip of an iceberg that is shaped, managed, and utilized by special interests.

That's like saying air isn't a human right. I'll agree with Nestle when they take away water from the CEO as well as everything he owns that was made using water. 

He would be living in the streets, butt naked and starving.
water is not a human right, though.

You have to make a distinction between right that obliges actions and right that obliges inactions. A right to life simply requires that nobody harms you, it obliges inaction. A right to liberty is the same.

A right to healthcare on the other hand obliges a doctor to do something for you. So a right to healthcare itself infringes on the right of doctors. On the other hand the right to seek out healthcare does not.

The right to water and the right to seek out water are different in this regard.

If you respect that private property is a right, and you accept that a source of water can be private property, then nestle has every right to use its own property how it wants.

Just because somebody is starving does not make me guilty for going to the fridge and making myself a sandwich.


Good luck boycotting all of Nestle's products.

EDIT: Alright I get it, guys. You all make your food from scratch or don't eat processed food. You've been boycotting Nestle unintentionally for years 
If youve ever had Nestle bottled water, youd know damn well that not all bottled waters are equal. That stuff is disgusting
Try the Buycott app. It helped me identify more Nestle products to avoid.
Yup, if I have a choice Nestl√© is not chosen 
I've been boycotting nestle at every opportunity for years now. They are evil
Piggybacking off of your comment:

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands) are the various brands owned by Nestle. Avoid them whenever you can if you want to make a difference.
I'm curious if they think their drought wouldn't be as bad if nestle closed the bottling plant, because all considering it's a really really small percentage of the total water used in that area. 
The problem is that there's so many battles to fight.

Nestl√© extracts water from drought stricken areas for profit, destroyed a generation of African children with their baby formula plot, sure. Avoid Nestl√© products. Overfishing is destroying the ocean ecosystem, leading to long-term consequences that may compare to climate change in the long term. Avoid fish, too. (Don't forget isinglass, a product of cod, is used in beer and wine.) Factory farms cause untold suffering to entire species, endangering the animals and our own health. Sure, go vegan, or only buy ethically-sourced meats and animal products. Cosmetics and soaps are tested on animals, gotta check that label. Pesticides, unregulated GMOs, Monsanto, gotta Google that shit before you buy. That's not on the label. And I'm sure there's a hundred other causes that I've never even heard of, each demanding a complete boycott of any product under the sun.

Fighting every battle at once is impossible, and these corporations will cut their expenses for each person avoiding their products in order to keep their profit margins stable, which can exacerbate the problem.

I'm not saying that boycotting the products you don't like isn't valuable, but it's na√Øve to think that it's possible to shut down a corporation whose consumer base is so staggeringly large through boycott. Solutions need to be found through legal means, not through market means.
Sadly, this is like the entire grocery store.
This is definitely do-able. Is this a complete list or is it missing things? 
Are you sure the town supply is from the spring and not from lake reservoirs like most Canadian towns and cities?

[removed]
1.4 trillion litres a day at $3.71 per million litres comes out to like $3M a day, just for water. 4 bucks seems cheap but in the grand scheme of things a million litres isn't a lot for these companies. I don't think they can reasonably charge different companies different amounts based on usage, as it's the same water and infrastructure to get it. Mining companies will use a shit ton compared to Nestle, but how do they legally charge Nestle more than the mining companies?
Ontario is fucking huge and it has lot of water.  Edit: and apparently that figure is for all of Canada anyhow, so you're right.
[deleted]
My bad. I read wrong. The 20 million litres refers to all of Canada, not just Ontario. It's only 8.3 million litres for Ontario. That changes the ratio to 1,686,000:1. Does that help?

Would you have been any less upset if they were bottling beer? Breweries use and incredible amount of water per bottle produced. Something like 200 litres per litre of beer.

I'm not familiar with the area, but isn't lawn watering still allowed? Couldn't be much of a drought.
He's not honest, he a self proclaimed liar
I'm just realizing how truly moronic people are.  To be concerned about the bottling of water for human consumption when it is literally less than a drop in a bucket of all water used, even in a drought stricken area?  Holy shit people have not the foggiest idea of what difference between millions and trillions even means.  I feel stupider for even having posted in this absurd circle jerk.
Water refills are much lower in Canada in recent years. Heavy rain in bursts rather than consistent precipitation, and hot summers. My community hit a water restriction level a week earlier, this year compared to last. 
If we were running out of farmable land then you might have a point, but we aren't so you don't. 
Why would someone replace a golf course with a farm when there is already tons of unused land available?  Golf courses are located close to residential areas where land is much more expensive.  Nobody in their right mind would do this.
And farms could be great golf courses.
That reading comprehension
Did you even read the rest of the sentence?
its got what plants crave, electrolytes
And all of it goes to the "highest" form of water consumption - drinking it.

Here is a person who uses logic and doesn't use emotion as their argument. Thank you for that.
I think it's more 'Coca Cola is doing a good thing, but Coca Cola only does selfish things, so this good thing is no-doubt done selfishly.'
> No one does anything just for the sake of doing it--just for the sake of "being nice".

That's obviously not true, unless you think the satisfaction of doing a good thing that doesn't materially benefit me is also in a way selfish, which could be argued is the objective basis for human morality and ethics via empathy.

By your rationale people would never raise a finger for human suffering in a part of the world where that suffering has no jurisdictional effect on anything domestic to your life like their suffering couldn't even bee seen as having a precedent effect on the value of life in your country.

And yet we know people go far abroad to help those who need it for basically nothing in return but the satisfaction of their conscience. I think your thesis is mostly laboured and forced. Its a warping of Adam Smith that is all too common.
> No one does anything just for the sake of doing it--just for the sake of "being nice"

Speak for yourself. Tons of people do good things without expecting reciprocity every day.
I don't get it,  hasn't this exact thing been done by these exact companies in other countries?  It HAS been privatized in some places, has it not?
This article is about how much the Government of Ontario charges for water. I'm a miner in BC and there's looming new regulations for the same thing - pay for how much water you use. They delayed because of the backlash from it but this will affect me - what I used to have a RIGHT to I will now have to purchase.

If you have a different definition about what privatization is, please enlighten me. Because as it stands - those who can buy the water can use it and that's the definition of privatization.
Came here to say this. I'm pretty sure they also went as far as to convince African women that formula was better than breast milk which is why women jumped on the formula train. Also, you know what's widely and readily available in Africa? Clean drinking water.

Yeah but Mcdonalds isn't completely innocent either, like with the hot coffee scandal, where the old laty got absolutely mutilated with scalding coffee. She only asked McDonalds to pay for the hospital bills. Mcdonalds refused and used the forced secrecy of the case to make it look like the old lady was sueing them for millions for just spilling her coffee, even though they'd received 500 prior complaints that the coffee was dangerously hot.
Serious question, what would change if Nestle stopped taking the water? Would the drought suddenly stop? Are the people from the town also taking water from the same source and there is competition?
Assuming [250 liters / person / day](https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=en&n=7E808512-1), those 7000 people use 1.7 million liters / day *just* for their personal residential usage. That's not counting any other industry or farming (which probably uses way more than anything else) in the area, which are way bigger users than residential.

20 million liters sounds like a lot but it really isn't.
The town doesn't have the equipment to tap into that aquifer themselves. So it makes literally no difference to them. 
[deleted]
The cost of transporting water actually kinda does put a significant limit on how non-locally they can distribute it.
What's the big deal if it's not sold locally?

Why purify water to drinking level standards if 95% of it is going to be used for showering, toilets and watering the yard? Purification requires chemicals, energy and $$$. 


[deleted]
Careful,  they'll get you next. 
It also does not leave the area. People are acting like the water is just disappearing. Nestl√© isn't going to pay to ship water. It's heavy as shit. It's shit like building pipelines to siphon water from the great lakes that is disgusting.
Install a water filter on in your kitchen sink, problem solved. You'll save money in the long run. 
Ea..... Eat ...  Eat oreos
Yep, last time I looked up the numbers it looked like golf courses and industrial/residential use made up very little of the total water usage in AZ. Agriculture however, made up somewhere close to 60 percent of Arizona's annual water usage. Really we just need to stop growing crops in the desert.
That's far to inconvenient for most people, protecting the planet is only a priority when it's easy and ideologically driven.
It's kind of crazy, he was talking about [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/jLyG9W8) and [this](http://sprinklerheadtrimmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Golf-Course-Irrigation-001.jpg), which you'd think the vast majority of people in this thread would agree with, but all they heard was [this](https://faithrxd.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Thirsty.jpg) and [this](http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff427/gibbiv/Wordpress/good-hygeine-public-health.gif).  
It doesn't mention anything about breathable air either. Maybe we should privatize that.

Uh huh

Then when you do the research it turns out those big numbers are a fraction of what the truth is. The truth big ag spends millions to hide.

Well, not enough, clearly.
Obviously never lived in the western US where all water is owned by someone.
people keep posting this and people keep ignoring what he was talking about in true reddit fashion. He was proposing that water beyond what is needed for life not be given away freely. It was proposed as a solution to the problem of wasteful water usage in the west because it is so goddamn cheap. Water beyond what is needed for life is not a human right, which i agree with. Look at what we do with all the water in the US because it's cheap... we aggravate drought conditions by using mass amounts of it to water crops and feed cattle. We use massive amounts of it for manufacturing and watering golf courses. All of these companies pay peanuts and account for the vast majority of water use. All because it's practically free.

Of course it doesnt play in the the evil nestle circle jerk so people will probably downvote me.
Except that it's not about that at all.  It's a point of contention in political science and philosophy known as negative rights and positive rights. The jist is that many would argue that you are incorrectly applying a broader definition of the word "right" to the topic of constitutional rights.  From that perspective you aren't owed anything because it's your right - but rather a right is something you cannot have taken from you by way of government action. I.e. right to free speech, right to be secure in your possessions, right to bear arms.  The government can't take those things from you.

So it's not about saying your fine with people dying...it's about saying the idea of a "right to water" doesn't make sense. Agree or disagree if you will
That would be a need.  A right is something that people can't be allowed to sell.  Make it so people can't sell it, and who's going to collect it, build infrastructure to distribute it, or spend money to ensure its cleanliness?  All water distribution would have to be taken over by various governments.  That's not in itself more worrying than corporate control over such things, but neither is it a panacea.  What happens when the government is corrupt/nepotistic?  What happens when the government doesn't have the ability to provide that service?  What happens when the government of Michigan doesn't actually care enough to not poison Flint?  There are some places where the optimal solution is for the government to take over such functions, but many more where it is not.  Those places still need the ability to get someone to do that, and profit is a motive that works for many purposes.
Nestle is not a great company but the quote about water was taken out of context. The CEOs point was essentially that it is good to privatize things like air and water because they will be better protected. Essentially his point is that there is a cost associated with protecting those kinds of resources and the private sector is better at protecting than the public sector. Do I think this is a good idea hellll nooo but I do see his point in theory

Who gives a shit what Reddit thinks. You can form your own opinions on people. A lot like him. That's it.
It became that way when reddit was popular. Quite honestly, personally, he's never been funny to me. 
He's not a conservationist. He's a businessman. When he says water is not a human right, he follows right behind that with saying water is a foodstuff. He said that he doesn't understand why people think they deserve water. They are made to pay for other foods and beverages, right? Why do people think water should just be given to them?
You do realize they pump in California while they're in the middle of a drought right? And he specifically said it was an extreme position to believe water is a basic human right. 
Nestl√© propaganda worked on you I see.
Can't believe his or Nestl√©s bullshit when they pump water out of the ground as fast as they can to sell it for top dollar while there is a drought and they are causing permanent damage to ecosystems and aquifers/water tables that collapse when they are emptied....they play the PR game and use it to make themselves look good and in turn nobody pays attention to what they do
Nice to have more context.
This assumes that water outside of your body should be considered anything but communal property. 
In arguing the reality of the current construct, yes.  In arguing the reality of requirement, no. 
On top of that, the article specifically states that there is a requirement for the local environmental authority to post the request for public comment, which didn't happen.  
Shady business practices to me invalidate any claim. 


> water is not a human right, though.

This is one of the dumbest things I've seen on reddit. Water is the most essential thing to life. If that's not a human right, then what is? Is living a human right? Yes I did read your whole post...it's all stupid.
Looks like my diet of doner kebabs and lager wins again! Take that Nestle! 
Clicked the link with no hope. Turns out, as suspected, I've purchased uncounted Nestle products over the years.  Thankfully, and beyond all hope, I do not anymore.

Then again, I'm sure I buy a thousand other ethically grey brands so there's that.
TIL that I'm unintentionally already boycotting nestle.
That's why I said I do my best. I know they sell tons of random shit
So it totally depends on your diet. The only thing I have used on that list is maggi boullion cubes, zephyrhills water, and Loreal lipstick. If you don't eat a bunch of packaged foods it's not terribly hard.
None of this seems to be anything anyone needs or is better off by having.

App is likely made by Nestle to ensure they've ensnared you either way. 
Tell us what you can't live without and let Le'Reddit give you alternatives.
> it's a really really small percentage of the total water used in that area.

Do you have a statistic to support that? I haven't been able to find any info on how much water is actually used in the area. 
You bring up great points, but I don't see those two pathways as mutually exclusive. Just that your average person is less likely to make any sort of impact through the judicial system than they are through the market. However, I do agree that combining those two means of impact will result in a larger one overall.
Vegan and organic cosmetics? Psh, piece of cake.
I still don't get what is so horrible about GMOs and Monsanto. Genetically modified stuff has been proven to be safe for a while now 
You can get sustainably pole and rod caught fish in most Target stores as well as other "organically" responsibly raised animal products like eggs and chicken as well.
I feel like this is a hyperbole....how big is your grocery store? I imagine it would probably be much more difficult depending on your location and socioeconomic status.
It's all ground water wells.
it should go without saying, shouldn't it?
Higher usage should cost increasingly more. 

Basically, companies should pay for anything they take out of the environment and anything they put into the environment. Cost determined by the harm done and amounts used/output. Capitalism can work if companies actually pay for their resources, customers will adjust spending in response, as capitalism should be. 
The question is how much does untreated water cost? If they are pumping, cleaning, treating and bottling the water what is the cost of the water? In my opinion that's pretty difficult to figure out maybe 1/20th of a penny. 
That's roughly what people get charged. 

When you buy water you pay for the finished product. 

When a company gets a water extraction license they pay for the right to remove water but still have to pump and treat it themselves...
 
The biggest part of your water bill is the sewage part. In my community it is about $1 per thousand liters for the clean water delivered...and $2 for the sewage part. If you just go and fill a truck with water it is $0.4 per 1000 liters. 

If you drill a well it is free for personal use... in the california case nestle was paying for the water use rights. Everything else was on them.
Why not? 
Most citizens that drill their own well don't get charged at all for water taken out of an aquifer.
Individuals that operate wells for drinking or irrigation don't pay for water at all. However, they do have to pay for the well construction, maintenance, and treatment.
[deleted]
Do you also assume that average citizens all have their own well and don't need any infrastructure like untold miles of pipes?
No. Ontarians pay 3$ 1000l. Or m3 whichever you want to call it. 

So Nestle should he paying 3000$ for what they get.

I mean, in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot to a big city, but I'm sure a few extra grand a day would be nice to a small town
That's funny....

Nobody is stopping them from doing this. No government regulations have stopped or punished all of the ridiculously evil things Nestle has done.

A boycott of goods is a free market solution to the problem, but in a land of consumers who are too apathetic to learn or care, nobody cares enough to do so.  A lot like American politics.
Indeed it would, but this isn't a free market. If you set the price too low, then demand will exceed supply and that is what is happening. If you want companies to use less water just raise the price of water. Alternatively just hold an auction for the amount of water you want to be extracted and don't allow more to be extracted.
Reddit played right into the california government's hands. They scapegoated nestle when it was really bad in the drought, no mention of the agricultural sector and reddit ate it right up without second thought. Only a few people in every comment thread about this topic know how little of an effect nestle actually has. 
Own a brewery. Our ratio is not 200:1. It's under 5:1, and probably by quite a bit. 3:1 maybe? Less? I don't know. Your ratio is laughably absurd. 
Dont bother man, i tried to explain this when the same thing happened in CA, was using a similar 3,000,000 : 1.  But noone wants to hear logic and reason, they want to hear about how some big corporation is stealing everyone's drinking water.


water good, corporations bad, using your brain is worse.

ta-da
If you think your statistics actually mean something in this context then I think you've entirely missed the point of the opposition.  

This is a local issue and doesn't relate to the amount of water being taken out of Canada or Ontario, it relates to how much is being taken from a source of water that a community depends on, and if the wells start running low, who gets first dibs on the water? The corporation with a contract to extract X amount of water, or the locals? It raises the question of who has (and who should have) ownership over the natural resources of a community: the community or private industries? When do the needs of one override the other? Is the government doing their due diligence to plan for the future needs of a community? How much does the community need to look after itself?

Droughts are becoming more and more common and this area has experienced water shortages in the past. If it was your water source in question, I doubt you'd want the impending risk of drought to be amplified by a multi-national corporation with questionable ethics and contractual rights to exacerbate the issue. 
Analysis should be based on watershed rather than a province or nation if the issue is sustainability. 
Much of the issue is that nestle is bottling and shipping the water elsewhere so it doesn't return to the local groundwater (like is the case with municipal usage, or watering lawns)
In think people that haven't been to North America have very little understanding of how fkn huge it is and how much of it is covered in agriculture.

Coca-Cola does *profitable* things. It just so happens on occasion they are Good Things‚Ñ¢.
Close.

"Coca Cola is doing a good thing" - it appears so. But isn't that the core of Coke's marketing? These sorts of campaign do good but aren't usually motivated by altruism. They're not doing this because they feel bad or good - Coca Cola isn't a person. They're a business which brings me to...

"But Coca Cola only does selfish things" - In a way. You continue to personify this organization. They're not 'selfish' - they don't have emotions like that. They're a massive for-profit business. They are trying to make money. If partnering with the Nature Conservency helps that goal, they will. That's what I believe happened and it doesn't prevent real conservation work being done out of it.

However, I articulated why this is an obvious conflict of interests. These companies are large users of water and will continue to use it through shortages as its their business. In a way, the Nature Conservancy is partnering with and accepting funds from organizations they should be the most critical of. 

And also, Coca Cola receives the benefits of having the reservoir of their primary ingredient carefully monitored and conserved - all the while pretending that they're doing it for the wetlands.

The public needs no help from Coca Cola to conserve water just as it doesn't need help from sawmills on how to conserve timber.

EDIT: To sum it up "So this not-black-and-white-issue-with-many-stakeholders may be influenced by Coca Cola and their funds to suit their interests.

For the uninitiated this is called an agenda. They're a thing.
>That's obviously not true, unless you think the satisfaction of doing a good thing that doesn't materially benefit me is also in a way selfish, which could be argued is the objective basis for human morality and ethics via empathy

That's exactly what I mean. Sorry for not clarifying and thanks for summarizing the mentality so well.
They do it because it makes them feel good. Which is the most selfish reason of all. /s

The issue, of course, is that if you make your formula with dirty water, the kid gets sick.
[This](http://archive.babymilkaction.org/pdfs/babykiller.pdf) is the report that kicked off the first wave of boycots and protests.  Or just google "Nestle Africa Formula" and you'll get a lot of stuff about it.
Oh yea. That was absolutely bullshit, but at least justice prevailed in that case. 
My point is that most of the water used in agriculture, watering your lawn, 20 minute showers, etc. all winds up back in the local water table. Nestle setting up a bottling plant and shipping it off while the local area is in a drought is 100% water loss.

Edit: That includes water lost in leaks of municipal water networks, it winds up back in the local water table. The bottled water is a 100% loss as soon as it gets shipped out of the area.
The difference is when the Wells for all the locals run dry because their water table is being given away basically free to a private company that sells it at a profit. 

My mom lives right in that area.  She hasn't had water at home for weeks.
Because 100% of that water is gone from that water table, it becomes egregious when the local area is in a drought on top of that.
Oh, I read your comment, and I understood it.

So I take it, then, that you couldn't find and fix more leaks if you had more money?...

> If we are talking about the problem of water scarcity, bottled water is probably the very best way to avoid water wastage. That's a fact, whether we like it or not, whether it cost more or not.

Sure.  In an environment where every single last drop of water has to be conserved, spending a lot more and polluting a lot more to bottle water probably makes sense.  It does not make any sense in most cases.

It's a fair point you make about the aquifers.  
Litres not gallons, and it is lots when there are drought conditions present, also the fact that the permit is expired, plus the fact that the cost to take water is ridiculously low.
Except the farmer's and resident's water is going back into the WATERSHED. Most salient point of all. Thanks, Nestle stooge.
...worked in Flint. Seriously, if you can get one of the poorest cities in the state with the largest water resources to privatize water, you can do it anywhere. Now all the poor people of Flint are drinking bottled water, and we're all just scrambling to understand what happened. It's a tactic of conservatives, destroy public utilities as proof of the government's ineptitude and in swings private companies to save the day...what you didn't know is that the right is actively colluding with these companies... they're the same people...a person is elected senator, sits on a committee, becomes personal acquaintances with the lobbyists, passes legislation easing regulations and is gifted with a cushy executive position upon retirement.
Can a Kenyan be elected President in Canada?
On the upside: we're all agreed this is outrageous, which implies the societal norms are in the right place.

On the downside: Nestle haven't been shamed out of their absurd position. But they're a particularly shameless company. (/u/Wootery trivia: the only company I boycott is Nestle.)

And of course the real downside is, well, what actually *happens*.
Nestle doesn't speak for the regular Joe.
Rights are made up. They don't exist in nature. People make them. We get to decide. We can decide on a right to water if we want.

There is nothing in principle different from deciding on a right to freedom of speech, a right to privacy, or a right to water (aside from the quibbling that philosophers do with made up problems and needless terminology, because that's how they get paid).

There is no such thing anywhere in the world that corresponds to a "right". They can't be discovered, by science, or by logic. They are decided upon. When we say that "people have a right to free speech" it means "we think it is important that people have free speech". When we say that "people have a right to water" it means "we think it is important that people have water".
Because the government creates a system of property ownership which inhibits my right to free water, this "point of contention in political science" shouldn't be relevant. 
We need to nationalize this shit, corporations  as a whole have failed on the whole self regulation thing.

> Why do people think water should just be given to them?

Where does this actually happen? Most people pay for the water coming out of their taps. It's cheap as fuck because it's heavily subsidized by the government, but that's simply paying for it indirectly.
That argument probably would hold more water (ha) if people everywhere were allowed to gather water from rain and store it for personal use


Care to tell me how much of California's water usage is contributable to Nestle (hint: it is negligible)? You're scapegoating.

And here's the thing: if water is a human right, then a person is entitled to use as much of it as they like. I can fill up my pool, water my lawn, and wash my car and if you complain then I just say "nope, water is a human right and I'm using my right to do this with it!" How do you respond?

Amazingly, water (particularly clean, drinkable water) is a scarce resource that means when one persons uses more of it, there's less for others. Contrast that to the right of free speech (which is NOT the right to an audience!) where your exercise of the right doesn't diminish the amount of 'free speech' available to others.

So how do we decide which person gets their 'human right' to water violated? Or do we decide that its only a right up to a certain limit? How do we decide that limit? Who gets to decide that limit?

That's the whole issue with making things a 'right,' it means everyone is entitled to it EVEN IF THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TO GO AROUND.

tl;dr He's exactly correct, making water a 'right' is stupid because it leads to very inefficient distribution of an EXTREMELY valuable resource.
But the former CEO was a big proponent of water conservation! Are you telling me that a corporation is hypocritical about a topic that affects them? Nonsense i tell you!
You do realise that bottled water makes something like 0.008% of the total water usage right? Cattle and their feed takes up the majority of the water usage. 
You do realize that they are a drop in the bucket in California.
You should focus on wasteful practices in agriculture and other shitty uses for water such as watering golfcourses if you really want to argue about California lol

You do realize that the human consumption of water of in california is a manufactured problem. We have plenty of water for consumption but the government uses droughts that primarily effect business and ag to promote water saving and delay investment in needed infrastructure while jacking up prices. 
How is not taking the quote out of context propaganda? 
Clothing, shelter and food are human rights, too. Yet private companies supply all of those. What is so different about water in principle that it shouldn't be owned by single individuals or companies?
You certainly didn't understand his whole post then, and it's not his fault.
Human rights are negative rights. They don't require labor or services from other people.

Ethical consumption under capitalism is impossible. If you did your research on every single little thing you bought it'd be a full time job and you'd probably end up spending a ton of cash on free range animal crackers.

Nestle is not ethically gray... Its well into the dark side.
> a thousand other ethically grey brands

Yeah, nowadays that would be damn near anything mass-produced. It's harder to find a company that isn't doing something shady -- or is a subsidiary of a larger, shadier company. If you do find one, odds are high it's not doing well financially.
I was just thinking that. It's kinda luck that I don't buy their brand, like I had no idea about cheerios for instance, I don't buy them but I would not have realized they were nestle. However the places where I get my other stuff from I don't know much about, except specific things that I researched at one point. Hmm.
Pretty much.   
Although, there was 1 or 2 on that list that I didn't realize. Time to cut those out.
Seriously...almost everything in that list I've never even heard of, and the stuff I have, I haven't eaten or drank in years. Just because it is a long list doesn't mean that they have a lot of products in your country.
[removed]
Yup, haven't used much of their products in years.
Nestle owns a lot of companies but can we prove what you say?
NP friend, according to the article the permits they issue allow 1.4 trillion liters to be harvested daily for all the different companies and uses. and If the nestle plant is taking 20 million liters daily then than that means it's something like .00001428... Percent of the total water issued by those permits. Of they closed the Nestl√© plant alone that's hire much of the water they'd save.
> Just that your average person is less likely to make any sort of impact through the judicial system than they are through the market.

I'm no economist or political theorist, but my feeling is that an individual's impact on either is fairly equal. Although I will agree that boycott has more immediate steps for a protester, its effect is much less than even a single vote for a politician whose cause aligns with yours.

Although, like I said, I'm not an expert, and I'm making these arguments mostly from feeling. For what it's worth, I've been boycotting bottled water and fish products, the former for economic reasons (I'm poor) and the latter for preservationist ones.

I don't think it's self-evident at all. What is the reasoning behind the idea that natural resources shouldn't have bulk discounts? 
A lot of things should go without saying.

It's the people of Ontario's water so why should anyone have to pay for it?

There's only two reasons to charge the public for their own resource - to pay for managing that resource or to limit demand. There's not much reason to put time and effort into policing small wells.

EDIT: ITT - Oilers who have no idea how royalties work.




[deleted]
[deleted]
Given what they're charging for that water down the line, I think it's fitting that Nestle should pay a significantly higher rate.  Non-residential, for-profit use should be under a different system.
Most of what you pay isn't the water itself, it's treatment and distribution where a lot of the costs lie.
Basically the local taxpayers are subsiding Nestle's profits.
You mean buycott? It does pretty much that.

I stand corrected. The [industry standard](https://www.brewersassociation.org/educational-publications/water-wastewater-sustainability-manual/) is about 7:1 with some brewers coming in under 3:1.

Still use multiples of what a water bottler uses.
But Nestle is actually a pretty terrible company.  This particular situation aside, they don't have a solid reputation for caring about human beings.  Particularly when it comes to water.  Of course there is also the child labor issues, the horse meat in their beef,  and of course telling mothers to use their powdered milk instead of breast feeding. They don't have a good track record.  They may not be in the wrong in this particular situation, but it's totally fine to be tough on a company that is objectively bad for the world.  We absolutely should be keeping a close eye on them.

Edit: Downvoted for facts?  These things actually happened.  Not paying attention to Nestle is the same as watching someone steal 3 car stereos and then leaving your car unlocked and walking away.  
So basically if complaining about a corporation is bad, but not complaining about a corporation is bad too...then what do we actually do? How do we use our brains, I need to know! Who can I go to for the facts about the historical and contemporary practices of a company when they're **all** supposedly biased?

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 
>...it relates to how much is being taken from a source of water that a community depends on, and if the wells start running low, who gets first dibs on the water?

And just who do you think is the best judge of this? The community perhaps? Did or did not the community provide the permission? Are you pissed off that you don't get to decide? The water belongs to the community. The only people who can truly complain about this are those people who pump from that same aquifer. It affects no one else, and should be nobody's business but theirs.
It's way better if you can convince people they're actually good things. Or they're doing a good thing by buying your product. Or supporting your company in a Reddit thread.

This is how greenwashing works. No one wants to actually conserve. We want to consume and be told it's a Good Thing.
I think ANYONE who made it this far, is aware of the incredible sarcasm.  For the special /u/ who is unaware, I have no advice for you.  You missed the short bus even.
How do you know that most of the water used in agriculture is consumed locally?

And it's this bit of education that should really be the story.  The headline should have read "Corporation makes millions draining towns water supply while government does nothing to stop it."

It's okay though...we're in America, living the American dream./s

I'm sorry this is happening to your mom and her community.  If you're in California (which I am) this pain will be coming to more communities unless our state starts making serious and immediate changes.
And this is the future. Get your game up!
When your well runs dry blame the person consuming 0.00014% that makes bottles of water for sale, makes total sense.
[deleted]
that's really not a huge amount of water, even considering the drought. 

.0000143 percent of the 1.4 trillion liters total vs the .5 percent farmers are taking.


Depends, really. If sprinklers are used during a hot day, it is likely that the water will almost entirely evaporate. It's a really big issue.
Someone pointed out that it doesn't go back to the same source, plus it's contaminated with a whole bunch of shit
Honestly, both the left and the right are completely corrupt so I disagree with putting this on either one. They are two sides of the same coin to me, and I highly doubt Nestle gives a fuck who does it for them. They shouldn't get a pass that easily by saying "if it wasn't for those damn right wingers..." because it simply isn't true. If the right wing did not exist, Nestle would still be stealing your water, and flint's water supply would still be toxic.
I used to think boycotting companies was a silly form of protest but after learning (on Reddit) what Nestl√© did to mothers and newborn babies in Africa I don't at all have a problem with people boycotting them. Fuck Nestl√©.
Arguably they do.  Every dollar they make comes from an average joe that chooses to shop nestle.
The regular Joe can speak? Next you're going to tell me he can read!
Not saying you're wrong, but what you're saying is entirely contrary to the Constitution and bill of Rights, which states that the rights we have *are* natural and that's what makes it so important that they be protected. It's meant to protect the rights we naturally have, not "give" us rights. I'm not so sure I want the only things I might consider to be "rights" to be things the government decides it will *allow* me to have. That strikes me as quite a dangerous concept. Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, but your argument basically has to contend with concepts at the very core of our constitution, and that's a pretty high bar to meet.

A Constitutional right to Clean, Safe Drinking Water
> There is nothing in principle different from deciding on a right to freedom of speech, a right to privacy, or a right to water 

Except there is a difference, that's the whole point of the distinction between positive and negative rights.

A negative right merely requires the government to *do nothing* to infringe upon it.  All the government has to do to respect my right to free speech is to leave me alone.  The same cannot be said with a positive right to healthcare or clean water.

That being said while I'm not a proponent of positive rights, I still think providing such services are a good idea.  A service need not be a "right" for the government to provide it.

> Rights are made up. They don't exist in nature. People make them. We get to decide. We can decide on a right to water if we want.

Sure, and some people follow different made-up belief systems.
Bullshit. That's like saying the governments enforcement of property rights, inhibits me from taking food grown on agricultural land, so in turn I'm being denied free food. 
And governments as a whole have failed the whole regulation thing.
comedians can be social commentators, people relate to them so it makes sense that they would give their opinion weight, especially if they often include politics in their standup. I havent seen Bill Burr though.
What? Bill Burr is one of my local sources for news along with Jarule for insightful political discussions.
Some people think laughter happens at moments of deep realization.  When a lot of thoughts connect at once, forming a much larger coherent structure than existed before, that's "funny".  

If that's true then a comedian's job is to help people see things clearly.  

Of course there are things that form large connections which aren't aspects of the world, but rather just large thought structures which have been built specifically for their comedic effect.  Like in a running gag, part of the sudden connection is connecting this instance of the gag to all the previous instances.  

But overall, a comedian must speak the truth to tickle people's humor.

I was waiting on you cunts. 
They should stop beer companies and soda companies too, they use an incredible amount of drinking water as well. Throw those in with your shitty uses for water. 
Sure, but pumping remaining water reserves from a drought stricken area to be sold elsewhere does seem like a pretty odd thing to allow happen. Water is so tight that these sorts of practices shouldn't be embraced, they should be curtailed. In fact, the whole "bottled water" industry is just a big con for the most part.
Exactly. I despise Nestle for a lot of reasons. They've done some incredibly inhumane and downright criminal things in the past and I hate them for that. Which is exactly why I wish people would quit taking this shit out of context. There is a HUUUUUUGE difference between saying "water is not a human right" and "using AS MUCH WATER AS YOU WANT is not a human right".
There's a lot of good reasons to hate Nestle, but when people run around trumpeting false arguments like that it makes your entire position look bad.
Well, in California anyway, water is a public trust resource that belongs to the citizens.
Yeah, that's why homeless shelters give out food, clothing, and shelter to those who can't get it on their own. 
If it makes you feel better even when Foxxconn had it's rash of suicides in 2010 it was still decently under the average suicide rate of free American citizens. So statistically the chinese worker that built your device is happier than we are. Uplifting right?
Can't argue with that. 

Though I'd likely put about as much onus on human nature in general. We put more emphasis on immediate comforts than ethical choices by nature. Besides, human condition was hardly better under any previous political/economic systems.  I'm not really sure where I'm going with this...

Oh and plenty of goods made in India, Bangladesh (where workers died in those fires and collapsed buildings), China, etc. throughout my home.
I agree that it's likely luck for me as well more than anything else. I do try to pay more when I can absorb the cost and when benefits are being offered to employees along with career path/sustainable wage. Obviously, I fail on a daily basis to do this consistently. 

I still put my hopes on technology. Perhaps one day soon, those of us willing to buy can buy from vertical farms in our busy localities, and local clothing stores can supply us with relatively affordable garments from cheaply printed machines. Wouldn't that be nice? I know I dream but still, maybe.
Hot pockets and stuffer for me. Got scared when I saw Golden Grahams but they only own that in non-US markets. I that would have been tough.
What blows my mind is that the sales reps were dressed as nurses and acted like its the best way to feed the baby. And then they don't even have decent water sources to mix the formula with.
They do this in America too, when every new mother is given a free diaper bag with cans of formula in it. Imagine instead if every mother was given a free nursing cover.
Why would they do that? Serious question? 
This sounds interesting. Can you link more info?
Oh no I thought by area you meant the area where the waters actually being drawn from. See the opposition to Nestle in this case isn't coming from the provincial level but the municipal level. The 1.4 trillion daily is being drawn from the entire province and gives no perspective on how much is being drawn from any particular aquifer.   

Some aquifers have a larger supply than others and the one's relating to this news story have a history of drought. What I'm looking for are some statistics to show if what Nestle wants to extract actually has the capacity to affect the threshold at which droughts in the community occur. 
I admire your sensibilities. Keep up the good fight.
Bulk discounts is a selling strategy. You offer bulk discounts on your product so buyers buy bigger quantities on it. 

Charging for a natural resource has two reasons: 1st, to make sure it's not freely over-used. 2nd, to get some money on the side.

Under this two reasons (in contrast to a business, which only has the 2nd one), bulk discounts make no sense.
Because they're finite resources and bulk discounts encourage waste. 
I feel like if I bottled 50,000 litres a day I could make a living.
In the United States, that's 13,200 gallons per day. 


> It's the people of Ontario's water so why should anyone have to pay for it?

Because you can pull too much and fuck it up.
You can pull water out of the Great Lakes for free in many areas, transport it to your home and pump into your very own storage tank.  It would probably cost about 2-3x the average Ontario water bill once transportation and treatment come into play though.
I can't tell if you are being serious with that comment.
If you want to boycott all these shitty megacorps that own half the world all you have to do it buy real food.  By real fruits, vegetables, meats, breads, nuts from a local market.  Nestle does not sell healthy food.  They sell manufactured shit.  Not buying this shit is win-win for anyone who does it.
Also available for iOS under the same name. Any idea if it's possible to have it only complain about stuff I care about?
The free market won't fix everything, but one thing it is great at doing is finding a fair price for commodities like water. No one is being abused here, the government of Ontario is selling water at a certain price and then people complain that they are selling too much water. That is not the fault of the buyers, that is the fault of the government setting a price that is too low similar to how if a supermarket sells their good meat at $0.5/lbs, then we shouldn't blame the buyers once the supermarket inevitably runs out of good meat. The fault was with the organization that set a price below fair market value.

Not allowing more water to be extracted is not a regulation. It is simply saying that people shouldn't steal (illegal wells) and the government shouldn't sell more. They own an asset (water) and it is not against free market principles to limit how much of that is sold.


How is a government entity deciding the price of a resource "free market"?

Have you people ever ever gotten close to an economics class?
Well, seeing as the horse meat issue was much larger than just Nestle. Also that Nestle were the ones that tested and reported the horse meat in their own products, which was the fault of their supplier. Then quickly took actions to remedy the situation. I don't think that's a huge flag against them. 

The child labor problem is something that permeates every single coffee and chocolate business, even fair trade stuff. Trying to fix the problem is often a lesson in futility. The companies set mandates make sure everything is running fine. Then when they come to check, it's chaos again. It's like patching holes in a sinking ship. Not saying they are absolved of responsibility, they absolutely aren't. But there really is only so much they can do if the local governments and business owners won't help.

Got me on the powdered milk thing though. That is pretty shitty.


You could put the numbers in context and find the actual worst offenders in a situation, not just the one with the best name recognition. My money is on the frackers, cemeteries, and golf courses.
It's fine to complain about Nestl√©, they have done enough to warrant criticism. It is fine to complain about over-use of water. It is not fine to complain about Nestl√© overusing water when they account for less than one millionth of the total eater consumption. They are completely insignificant in the question of how we use our water.
> How do we use our brains, I need to know

Don't. Just lay back, pop open your computer, and start 'batin'.
Wahhh? Your original statistics trivialized the issue by making the water Nestle extracts from this community appear as a drop in the bucket in the overall context of what takes place in province. My point is that the water Nestle extracts is not a drop in the bucket to the communities the water is actually being extracted from.   

I'm glad you agree that the community should be involved in the decision, but as the article says:  

>The group says the Ministry of Environment did not post Nestle‚Äôs renewal application for the usual 30 days of public comment, and instead granted the company an automatic extension without consulting people who live in the area.  

That is my point - that there is consistently a lack of consultation with communities when it comes to selling out their resources and environment to the private sector, and that "planning for the future" far too often takes a backseat to immediate corporate interests. 
Wake up sheeple, they're putting Cola in our water
Or that grey water (the water used for showers, cleaning your car, basically anything used that isn't sewage) isn't pumped to a local river, which then takes it away from the local water table.
You have said the same exact thing 3 times now. If leak detection doesn't make sense, does investing in infrastructure? We know how bad our systems generally are, but you keep going back to private water. Not once in these statements have you made suggestions about improving infrastructure.

How do you plan to continue giving (and guaranteeing) the PUBLIC water while allowing private interests to take the same water? 

If they know the area is prone to drought does the public interest of safe water really sit below the right of private companies to take water for profit? That's the ONLY thing I can gather from your statements. You don't ever make ANY mentions of the public or their access to water.

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not talking about scarcity as a resource, I'm talking about availability to the public. That's a different kind of scarcity. Food deserts exist all across the country (but food itself is not scarce), water deserts may follow given the current legal/economic arguments. 
There was a big fight recently in my state, there was a 200 foot long creek that flowed into the major river that Nestle wanted to use for a water bottle source. It's all going to the ocean 100 miles away and nobody needed that water but the people fought against it and won.

I can understand trying to help the environment, but when they can't provide any reason aside from corporations are bad then it's just ignorance.
We're actually Canadian, but I appreciate the sentiment nonetheless.
Nestle is doing the same thing in California. This story could apply to America if you just change the location info.

> If I had had more money, I would not hire ten more networks technicians. I think we are doing already doing a decent job on that 

Wait.  Municipal water is horribly wasteful, to the point that bottled water is defensible...but if you had more money, you wouldn't work on fixing the leaks?

> As I already said, I hate using water bottles and my everyday job is try making those disappear. I feel like you're trying way to hard to twist what I'm saying.

It's funny that you posted that in reply to a quote of mine that you'd butchered...

> My point was just that Nestle is probably a scapegoat when talking about water scarcity.

Well we don't really know.  The state of the aquifer in question isn't discussed in the article.

However, scarcity isn't the only question.  There's also ownership of essential natural resources, companies paying fair amounts for said resources, and Nestle's history of being unethical fuckwits.


That sounds something like "Sure, but they have a fucking ton of money at the Federal Reserve Bank and I only took a hundred thousand dollars!"

It's not a big deal when one looks at the larger picture, but legality doesn't require practical justifications.
Eh, that's only true in america because there isn't an American "left," but leftist ideology is real very much against the privatization of public utilities.
Im afraid to ask, but what exactly do you mean?
Yup.

People say *but no company is perfect*, and they may be right... but thank god they're not all as awful as Nestle.
Choosing Nestle at random off the shelf isn't quite tantamount to being educated on/accepting their practices and seeking out their brand in support.
Comedians are the best social commentators. It's what jesters were for in medieval courts. 
Frankie Boyle is a big one in Britain for tearing into our political shitstorm. He's blunt, brutal and hilarious. I think we are able to comprehend things better and become more acceptable of someones views and opinions when they add comedy to it. 
Pshh, and they say China's going to beat us. You'd have to get up pretty early in the morning to out-suicide a proud American.
That would be awesome. And I think it could happen one day. 
First of all you have to actually sign up for that, they don't just force it on you. 

And second of all, not every mother can breastfeed. I'm happy I had it on hand for the early days just in case things didn't work out, so I could make sure my baby got fed. I still have it, just in case. 

I totally get where you're coming from, and it would be great if they threw in a nursing cover too (though we shouldn't have to need those, but that's another argument), but I can't say I hate this particular program. 
Money! Let your child starve or buy formula. If few kids die along the way its no additional cost the company so it's not their problem.   
Profit. Simple as that. 
Breastfeeding does not come easily to everyone.  Plus we had an entire generation of people who were told formula was scientific and better for babies and breastfeeding was low class.  So that generation can't teach the current one.  For example, I breastfeed but I wasn't breastfed. 

So formula is right there to solve your problem of a hungry baby, from day 1.  If you have difficulty breastfeeding you may not put effort into continuing and the competing formula companies want to be the one your baby likes/has first/you continue to buy.  

So, free samples and coupons everywhere.  That critical association means you will buy that same product repeatedly for 18m to 2y. 

Edit: I thought you were asking why they give free formula in the U.S.   Bad nesting on mobile, sorry. 
He's talking about [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6)
Bottles aren't cheap
The machines that make the bottles are about 1.5 million dollars, and you'll need a filler plus conveyors, leak tester and an annealer. Profit margins on plastic packaging are razor thin, but the water is free or very cheap. One machine would probably turn out 50,000 bottles over a 12 hour period though if it had 8 cavities, so.. If you give me 2 million dollars we can probably get things started. 

Source: 8 years in the industry. 
Or you could ship it to people that need water.  Downside is your landlord is going to take your security deposit.  Upside is he was probably going to take your security deposit anyways for some bullshit reason.

There's only two reasons to charge the public for their own resource - to pay for managing that resource or to *limit demand*. There's not much reason to put time and effort into policing small wells.
This should be top. Thank you

The thing is, I still feel they have demonstrated that they put quarterly profits above human well being.

 I'll concede on the horse meat issue, it is more of a europe issue than a nestle issue.

Thank you for your response, I'm not even saying they did anything wrong in this particular issue. I just feel that keeping a close eye on a company like that, is in the best interests of humanity.

Nestl√© sent marketing reps dressed as nurses to third-world countries with free samples of baby formula to market and distribute it to mothers of newborn babies, as a replacement to breast feeding. However the mothers tended to be poor and often couldn't afford to buy baby formula after the samples ran out and, after not feeding their babies with breast milk for an extended period, they were no longer able to produce breast milk. So they'd basically be forced to go back to baby formula to feed their child.

If they could afford baby formula it would often be made with local contaminated water that unnecessarily endangered the baby's health. (This wasn't directly Nestl√©'s fault, but it was a consequence of their actions.)

Overall, it was pretty scummy. They might not have intended malnutrition of babies and babies becoming sick from contaminated water that was used to make up the formula, but they did very well know the effect of using baby formula in causing a mother's breast milk to dry up and they marketed it to the poorest people on the planet.
[deleted]
Nestle owns a chunk of the supermarket, including DiGiorno pizza.
The end result is the exact same though and supporting their actions through ignorance is just as bad.  
I signed up for nothing and I was given plenty of formula samples, including at the pediatrician's. 

I am fortunate to be able to breastfeed, but I personally was fed formula.  I found a home for all my free formula.  Some people need it.  

Formula itself is not bad...anyone who has been around a hungry baby for more than 10 seconds would understand.  That particular cry breaks your heart in a way that is difficult to articulate. 

Discouraging breastfeeding is bad, but that doesn't make formula inherently bad.  

Starving babies is bad.  So fuck nestle, fuck nestle so hard.  

But... that's ... nazi levels of evil.
Neither are the man hours associated with bottling 50000 liters. 
But water is, so don't buy it in bottles.
Ah. I see you've rented before!
Or to just flat out make money. Like how Alaska and Texas (and most states, but not California) charge severance taxes on oil extraction.
Tell me, what happens to a price of a resource during a shortage of it?

Does that price change influence your usage of it?

If that price isn't changing, why isn't it?
Farmers make food, I'm willing to give them license to do that. I like food.
A bottle a day keeps the doctor away!
No, that's CENTRIST ideology. 

Leftist ideology says that "the means of production should be held in common (by the workers)."   That's what "leftist" is.  It is fairly extreme to the right, to suggest that there should be NO commonly held assets, that everything should be held privately.  Unfortunately, that's rapidly becoming a mainstream view in the US. 
Wow. Fuck all of that.
Dollars are votes. Companies do things because they make money doing it. We tell them it is okay by buying the products. 

Politicians are the same way
"I saw a commercial and I liked it" is about as informed as the average consumer gets.

The notion of the informed consumer is a fable.
Those who are willing to be conned are as corrupt as those who con them. - Tom Robbins
Oh dude I definitely agree with you. I signed up for the program before learning about what Nestle did in developing countries, so any potential future formula purchases will be a different brand. 

But that's interesting how much you were given outright. I wonder if it's because we're in different countries, everyone I know has had to actively sign up to receive the free formula offers. In contrast, my hospital gave me breast pump accessories, to make it easier and cheaper for me to rent a pump. Which has already come in pretty helpful!

I think I came off harsh before, so I apologise. I just think it's a bummer when formula feeding gets a bit brushed off. There's so much of that out there these days, I feel for the moms who are forced to make that decision. But I see I misread and we're definitely on the same page :)
Yeah that's why this part of the thread is basically a how to: boycott nestle. They are seriously bad.
Look into Belgium and the rubber plantations if you want to find evil. 
You seriously think men are bottling the water? The industrial revolution happened eh, machines do that shit now.
Nestle Canada employs 7500 people across Canada and bottles over 20,000,000 bottles per day.  If my arithmetic is correct that's 97,000 bottles per person per year, so there's that.
It's just one guy with a callous for a hand.
Been about two weeks and still haven't received my check in the mail. About to call up my ex landlord and rip his old ass a new one.

Thing is, I probably won't get screwed in this if I make a fuss because the house I stayed in is literally falling apart, and he has neglected the place last legal extent. I was going easy on him but if he is actually trying to steal my money I will not. I still have friends living there who are at the tipping point, too.
That's not how royalties work. I didn't say you shouldn't charge for a resource. I said you shouldn't charge your own citizens for a resource that they own. Often, the companies that pay the royalties are from out-of-state.

Every single resident in Alaska receives regular checks from that royalty fund. They aren't charging their own citizens for the resource - they're *paying* them for it. You have it backwards.
Oh no worries...I am not OP, just trying to offer a different perspective.  No judgement :)

It is a weirdly mixed message here.  In the hospital they had Lactation Consultants everywhere.  I think I saw 7 different ones.  They gave me the right sized flanges for my breast pump, which insurance paid for.  

However, they put the fear of god in me about her weight.  I was literally spraying colostrum and she gained weight in hospital, but they still wanted me to supplement.  I had saved colostrum beforehand or it would have been formula.  Husband said no.  I was so scared.  I rebooked her first appointment a few extra days and I secretly weighed her in a colander on a postage scale.  Your ability to breastfeed is under constant threat here. 

She gained almost a pound by her first appointment and they let me alone.  But I made her write it down and sign it I was so afraid. 

Then they gave me a bag of stuff and formula with the angle that when on the go, formula is still useful for breastfeeding moms. 

Mixed messages. 

What country, may I ask?

You have to run the machines, do setups, clear jams, maintain the mechanical and electrical systems, ect. 
I've always wondered if these companies are measuring profit monthly on if they are able to pay the monthly bill on these insanely expensive automated robots that do all the work for them. I'd imagine a large portion is figured into that.

edit: Getting a few smartass replies from people who obviously knew what I meant. Are some of these companies renting/leasing these machines and then if so are the ability to make payments on them as important(if not more important) than sales(as I said I would imagine a large portion factors into that). If you have an investor who covers the cost outright of one or two of these machines for a smaller business said investor would worry more about long term sales rather than "Paying off the loan of the machines". 
Machines are horribly unreliable, and take many many people to keep them running.

They aren't royalties. It's a [severance tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_tax).

It doesn't matter whether it's a citizen or not. The theory is that the resource is owned by all the citizens and one person (or other entity) is converting it to his own and thus everyone else is being impoverished. So the extractor pays a severance tax and the public receives it.

> They aren't charging their own citizens for the resource - they're paying them for it. You have it backwards.

That's nonsense. Anyone who extracts oil in Alaska is subject to severance tax, even citizens. So if you are extracting, you aren't *being paid*, you are paying; because the net is that the amount a citizen would pay on that barrel of oil is less than their share of the severance tax.

And BTW, Texas doesn't have a permanent fund (the thing which pays residents) and starting this year Alaska may not either because the price of oil is so low.

You conflating the group being paid with the group paying is only confusing the issue. In all cases, the extractor is being charged, not paid.
>In the Nestle case, the appeals court said the plaintiffs could update their lawsuit to see if they could meet the higher burden required under the Supreme Court ruling. Several business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged the court to hear the case.

So basically there's still a chance Nestle will escape unscathed. This is absolute hypocrisy. Precedent aside, no company should be allowed to get away with this. Whether it was direct or indirect, Nestle, if culpable, should face a consequence.

Don't overpay for bottled water. Don't eat shitty frozen food. Don't eat candy. Gets you away from like 90% of their businesses and and improves your overall diet quality.
So many products across all industries are made with child labor.  It's sad to say but it's also why there are so many options (and thus we [Americans] have so many choices).

Edit: There was a KitKat right next to me...
Nestle CEO has stated that humans don't have a right to water.
This is not only clickbait, but lies. I suspected it was before even reading the article because Nestle isn't made up of stupid people -- they know knowingly using child slaves would be extremely bad for business if anyone could prove it. 

The article contradicts the body of the article because Nestle isn't even being accused of using child slaves, they're accused of something unclear: either a) buying from a seller who is known to have a child slavery problem, or b) buying from a seller from an area with a child slavery problem. 

>The plaintiffs, who were originally from Mali, contend the companies aided and abetted human rights violations through their active involvement in purchasing cocoa from Ivory Coast. While aware of the child slavery problem, the companies offered financial and technical assistance to local farmers in a bid to guarantee the cheapest source of cocoa, the plaintiffs said.
Nothing will change until you apply pressure to the persons responsible for managing Nestle's public image. Flood YouTube with videos of you pouring their products down the drain, throwing their products into the trash, your hand selecting the non-Nestle product on the shelf in the grocer, children spitting out the horrid tasting Nestle products and talking about thinking about the slave children made them sick, and on and on. 

If you want to show them your opinion paint a picture. They don't care if a few 10s of thousands stop buying. They are always expanding and influencing new buyers. If you want to give them a tune up get a million views on YouTude using the above strategy.

Otherwise, sadly, the world is too big to care. Do what it takes to make them feel your pain or accept the fact that you are morally pure but your protest is ineffective  and your indignation goes unnoticed by the monster who continues to lumber forward spurred on by the need to feed investors and a willingness to eat children.
In this day and age it is probably cheaper from a CSR standpoint to operate primary industries in African countries the way China does it - to simply buy the right to the land no strings attached and then staff the operation 100% with expats. No locals allowed. That way you can absolutely control the people working there. Too risky to outsource. American companies have had a lot of issues with being caught using sweatshops and child laborers before. They don't intend it but they can't keep an eye on their subcontractors all the time.
For the title i tought for a moment this was not the onion subredit.
The question is not whether Nestle deserves to be punished (I assume they did), the question is whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction.   Our courts must follow the law and not do what is "morally expedient".   Doing what is morally-expedient in lieu of following the law, leads to a corrupt system as 1) failure to follow rules leads to gaming of the system by those with connections, money and power and 2) we humans are poor judges of right and wrong on a case-by-case basis.

Unfortunately the article is not very coherent on the legal issues involved.  If the lawsuit was NOT dismissed, what does "In the Nestle case, the appeals court said the plaintiffs [NOT NESTLE] could update their lawsuit to see if they could meet the higher burden required under the [PRIOR] Supreme Court ruling.

That suggest that the court is saying that the plaintiff's have NOT yet shown U.S. court jurisdiction, but the court wants to give them more time to try and come up with an argument.  Is that correct?  If so, it looks like Nestle will most likely still get the case dismissed.
This must be the most comically evil sounding thread title I've seen in a while.
"We're gonna sue you for using child labor"

"pls no"

"k" 

Was that what nestle was expecting? 
Nestle is the first company I actively avoid buying products from. Fucking scumbags.

Does Nestle actually own slaves, or are people just blaming them for the crimes of their suppliers?
I'm never eating Nestle food again... Sent from my iPhone while drinking coffee and writing my novel on my macbook. Blame the corporations all you want .. I think if u really investigated you would realize they try... But unfortunately a lot of the countries that provide these services have very loose labor laws. The alternative would be to not do business there... Which also hurts the people as well. It's much more complicated than the Reddit community apparently can understand. Nestle, coke, nike, apple... Do you know what they all have in common? They are huge corporations that are easy targets. They aren't any worse than the smaller companies.. Just better targets. 
Aren't all workers who choose security over freedom, slaves?

Fuck Nestle. For their child labor and their bottling and exploitation of public water. Bullshit company.
isn't this the same company that was taking a ton of water in California for cheap and when asked to stop they said well if we don't do it someone else will so it doesn't matter.
Can someone ELI5 to me how this works? Nestle is obviously at fault; how is there even an option to just say, "Hey let's just forget about all this". How is this legal?
I just bought a case of Nestle chocolate milk powder.. Will be the last time 
Its not even real chocolate FFS. 
Nestle is one of the biggest piece of shit companies that exist.  Between this and the infant formula in China and probably a few other grossly unethical business practices I'm overlooking, Nestle is a legitimate cancer on society.
Justice would be consumers stop buying Nestle products, or they can secretly support slave labor and toss the buck to someone else has to make that decision (court in this case).
People need to boycott Nestle. That's the only way to get rid of this evil Corporation.
Good Nestle should pay for all the bad stuff they do
Start jailing executives and CEO's. If they don't want that burden either don't accept the job or don't engage in vile behaviour. 

How isn't that already the system? We need to take power away from these people or we're just fucking ruined, we really are.

The word you're looking for is not hypocrisy.
If Nestle can get in trouble for buying cocoa from wholesalers who buy from growers who use slave labor, should we not also punish those who bought cocoa from Nestle?
Nestle didn't actually go to Mali and enslave kids, just so you know.  They bought cocoa on the global market and offered assistance to farmers.  That's...not the same thing.  If a Foxconn worker commits suicide, should his family be allowed to sue a consumer who buys an iPhone, knowing the conditions that the iPhone was made in?

Nestle is the world's largest food company, has lobbyists, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce on their side. Worst case for them, they get fined. 
The issue isn't whether Nestl√© should be allowed to use child slaves. It's about whether American courts should be in the business of hearing cases where a foreign company did something bad to foreigners in a foreign country. There are lots of bad things happening all over the world. That doesn't mean American courts should be some sort of world police, offering a forum for lawsuits that have nothing to do with America. 
So we are prosecuting anyone involved with this acts that happen overseas?  Even if remotely involed.

Better arrest anyone who bought Nikes in the past decade.
1 million dollar fine, every 10 years when it comes to peoples attention or so. It stays a profitable practice and Nestle continues doing it until the end of time. 
What do you think the nest in their symbol is made out of?  Its made of the bones, blood and tears of all the people Nestle has crushed over the last century in their pursuit of unlimited money.  
Whats right, what's legal and what's not illegal are three very different things.
Nestle is not alone, everything on a supermarket is made by another "Nestle". That's the price of cheap things. You cannot retail at such low price without violations. We romanticize our own ethics and criticize. Enjoy the benefits of violations and criticize it.
Not only that, apparently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is *for* child slavery?
Hey if corporations are people too then they should be tried like people.

People shouldn't be consuming their food regardless of ethics. Its all junk food. 
If you're going to boycott unethical companies, you'll pretty much need to stop buying anything.

woa, how is Tony‚Äôs Chocolonely on the 'not recommend list'? Its actually a vegan list, not a sole "slave-free" chocolate list? 
Tony‚Äôs Chocolonely main selling point is that it is "slaafvrij". 
> Companies such as Nestl√©, Mars, and others are culpable, but are not listed as they do not make vegan products.

What does this mean? I'm trying to find out if MARS uses questionable practices but this list is incomplete. 
Oh, yeah, *massive* pieces of shit. There was also the time they gave out free samples of their infant formula in developing countries. They give new mothers just enough formula that by the time they ran out, they would have stopped lactating--so either they buy more formula, or their babies die. Pretty sure they straight up lied about the health benefits, too.
It's because they are.
I started boycotting their goods when I was pregnant, when I first heard about their [self-serving to the point of being cartoonishly-evil infant formula practises](http://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6). Since then, every *single* time I hear about Nestle, it's yet another piece about how they'll fuck over absolutely everyone and everything for the sake of posting a profit. Monsanto takes a lot of shit for putting corporate interests ahead of public health and safety, but it's like it's Nestle's sole purpose for existing.
They're one of the worst.  Read the next comment down.. they seriously want to monopolize the world's water.

ugh, a BI link.  Any other sources?

Seriously, [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZdkmbXo.png) is the ENTIRE article.  I hate BI.  

[Here's the link to the PDF](http://archive.babymilkaction.org/pdfs/babykiller.pdf) from the 'article'
40 years ago!  "Guys, I know we're all pissed off about Volkswagen cheating on emission tests, but why is nobody talking about the Jewish slaves they used during World War II?!!"
Except their recipes are probably trade secrets, not patented/trademarked. 
If the US ever invalidated a single patent as a punitive measure, businesses would never look at the country the same way again.  The economic loss over the following decades or longer would be enormous as companies choose to headquarter and operate primarily overseas.
Except foreign intervention has never been the answer to solving domestic labor rights issues. The struggle and demand must come from within the exploited country itself if you want to see a real lasting change. 
Yeah if you allow US courts to rule on international issues then you'll open a shots shotstorm of unintended consequences. 
With that logic shouldn't the US also invalidate all patents held by anyone who has bought a product containing Nestle's cocoa? If you buy a Kit Kat you're doing the exact same thing as Nestle. Purchasing a product which was sourced to slave labour. Nestle isn't rounding up people and enslaving them, they just bought something sourced to slavery. Millions of Americans are guilty of the exact same thing.
Congress doesn't care about human rights, they are part of the problem.
For fuck's sake
A Swiss company that owns 90% of major US food brands.
I thought this too. This seems like a case under the Alien Tort Claims Act, but SCOTUS has ruled before that the statue does *not* grant jurisdiction to a common nucleus of operative fact that has no connection to a US citizen, a US interest, or a place that is under the jurisdiction of Congress. I'm not seeing how any of this relates to a US district court unless the central allegation is that an American subsidiary of Nestle received the cocoa with sufficient scienter to permit a claim under the Alien Tort Claims Act. 
They imported their slave-produced chocolate to the U.S. market.
Alien Tort Claims Act. It's in the fucking article, you mong. 
It's a little old, but [here are their main brands.](http://i.imgur.com/8yotIkJ.jpg)

Note that Nestle do not fully own L'Oreal, but instead own 30% of them: A big chunk, and certainly enough to be the controlling shares, but not the whole company. It's up to you to decide if that's enough to include them in your boycott.
Not that it benefits me to increase demand for "real" (aka "high quality") chocolate, but there are truly high quality sources for chocolate, including fair trade certified, where the chocolate isn't grown under horrible conditions.  It's much more expensive, so you probably aren't going to pig out on it, but that's not an entirely bad thing.
Even if you boycott few of their products and not all, it still hurts their profit. Moreover, the negative PR they are getting should be changing their mind...
You shouldn't eat all that chocolate and support those bastards. Instead, just have a coffee or a Nespresso...oh godammit. 
Read this while eating a bag of Rolos. Feeling kind of dirty now. Nestle chocolate doesn't even taste good.
Happy birthday cake, motherfucker.
Could always drink a bottle of water....wait...never mind...they own most of that too which was harvested from limited water sources in third world countries. 
That was a lot of misinformed outrage I had to read through to get to someone who actually understands what's going on.

Many countries in the world, while having standards lower than places like the US, are not politically or emotional ready to have our "freedom" suddenly forced on them. Take North Korea for an example, if there is gonna be change, it needs to come from the people. If Sheriff US comes in and takes out KJU, it won't do North Korea any good. Until the people learn to stand for themselves, another dictator would simply fill the power void.

It is heartbreaking for those of us in developed countries, but the reality is, the people of lesser developed countries have to **want** social freedoms, not have it "gifted" to them.

They're just under a lot of scrutiny since they're huge. This is a systemic problem not limited to nestle. 
He said people should be guaranteed free water to drink, wash and cook but not to say fill their fucking pools or wash their cars. This comes up on reddit about four times a year. Do some reading before you parrot nonsense. Not saying he's a saint but this comment is just wrong.
There's a Youtube video of him talking about all his great ideas. One of his ideas he was most proud of was increasing productivity. Want to know the genius plan? Make your employees work more hours for  the same pay. That's how that guy thinks.
For the love of holy fuck, I wish people would stop claiming this.

The context of the sentence is so important and you're being intellectually dishonest by pretending that this is what he meant. It's soccer mom level discussion tactics that source most of their knowledge from Facebook image quotes.

What he was saying made a lot of sense and you're just making yourself look foolish by strawmanning the guy in such a ridiculous fashion.
Look, he's scum and their intentions with bottling water is scum but that statement was a bit out of context.
Or pay.  Or freedom.
Collusion is still a crime.
Slavery cuts labor costs which increases profit, and this is good for Nestle shareholders. In addition, decreasing labor costs reduces the final product's price which is good for consumers. 

And although this is true, it's also morally abhorrent and doesn't justify slave labor. 
The "Nestle apologist crowd" has to be smallest crowd ever. It appears almost everyone on Reddit hates Nestle. There are people who argue about how much culpability they should have, but I don't see anyone singing Nestl√©'s praises.
YES!  We used to have Nestle PureSource water delivered until we learned the full story .. Then, I installed an awesome 5-stage water filter bought from Amazon under my sink and we love it!  

The water tastes better, is arguably better quality, much CHEAPER, and we don't have to stockpile 5 gal containers in our apartment anymore ... :)

You could actually educate yourself on a highly complex topic...or you can sit there and post idiotic strawmen.
I see. Label those with different opinions than you to make it seem like any dissent is organized manipulation.


FACT: Nestle did NOT "steal water". They played within the rules. As they say, "don't hate the player, hate the game".
The question is not whether it is illegal - leave that issue aside. The question is whether a US court can hear a case concerning events in Mali. To do so would give our law "extraterritorial effect," something the current Supreme Court is very suspicious of. To succeed, the plaintiffs here (the ex child slaves) need to show that the events "touched and concerned" the US to such an extent that a court here should assert jurisdiction.
> Nestle is obviously at fault

You don't know how it works, but you've already decided the verdict.  This is why you are not a judge.
The headline of this article is an oversimplification of the facts surrounding the allegations. It also completely ignores the legal case that was petitioned to the Supreme Court. 

The underlying lawsuit is a class action brought by children who lived in Mali and were supposedly child slaves working on cocoa farms. They are suing Nestle for allegedly aiding and abetting the perpetuation of child slavery. Nestle buys cocoa which apparently originates, to some degree, from these farms in Mali utilizing child slavery. It is unclear if Nestle knows for certain that some of the cocoa it buys comes from farms utilizing child slavery. The theory is that Nestle has constructive knowledge that it's buying from these farms because it's implausible that it is not and they are just burying their heads in the sand. Whether that's true or not remains to be seen.

This is all about MONEY compensation to be paid by Nestle to the child slaves. It is not a criminal consideration or anything like that. 

If you are wondering how children from Mali can sue Nestle in a court in California, the plaintiffs are relying on the 1789 statute called the Alien Tort Statute. It states that an Alien (someone outside of the US) can sue the US for a tort arising out of the violation of a treaty or the "law of nations". There has been much debate in the last 3 or 4 decades about what actions can be brought under this very vague statute. In this case, there is some debate as to whether Nestle's actions give rise to a claim under the Alien tort statute. According to current case law, if the alleged wrongful acts do not occur within the United States, they must have a certain connection with and impact the United States. Further, there are varying degrees of intent required. It's a very complex legal question. 

Nestle made a motion to dismiss the case, submitting that the allegations made by the plaintiffs, even if presumed to be true, do not constitute a viable case where Nestle would have to pay them money for the wrongdoings. That is, the claim cannot be brought under the Alien Tort Statute. The trial court granted them their motion and dismissed the case. The appellate court reversed. Nestle then petitioned the Supreme Court for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. This is called petition for "certiorari". The Supreme Court gets to select which cases it will hear. It doesn't hear every case that asks to be heard. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal and now the case will proceed in the trial court to the next stage.

To be fair, the evil is what makes Nestl√© chocolate delicious.
We need a batman 
I mean it's actually a pretty good point, I think the question boils down to what was known. I think the average consumer doesn't know about slave labor being used down the line, but I bet Nestle did.
[removed]
We can't prosecute the wholesalers. We can prosecute this action when it first becomes an American issue as it involves a company that has a heavy footprint in the US. So in a sense we are attacking the problem as close to the source as we can
The average consumer doesn't profit from purchasing cocoa, but Nestl√© does. Nestl√© has a lot more information about their supply chain than anyone else, at the very least SOME of the blame is on them.
More to the point, the Supreme Court throws out cases like these because this type of abuse isn't happening in the US. Hell, Nestle SA isn't even a US company. The Supreme Court of the United States doesn't have jurisdiction in the West Coast (Ivory Coast) of Africa and, even if it did, a ruling by a United States court wouldn't stop this type of abuse from happening. Unlike the suggestions of some people here, the Supreme Court didn't throw out this case because of lobbying (which wouldn't even make any sense considering their Justices) or because of Republicans (lol).
It's not.  But if they know that the farms and the cocoa they're buying is sourced from slaves they definitely share the blame (possibly not legally, but morally).  A market can't exist without the buyers. 

If I buy stolen goods knowing that they're stolen that's a crime.  
Now I'm really scared. 
>the U.S Chamber of Commerce

Speaking of shitty groups.

Are you really surprised a Republican lobby group is on their side?


Per US Federal Law, any US person or corporation operating overseas is subject to the laws of the United States.

Effort.

People want to associate themselves with something good without putting the effort in to change themselves.

Additionally, people don't particularly like having a mirror held up to them that shows their own poor actions. They'd rather bury something and pretend it doesn't exist rather than face up to themselves and change.

Same reason smoking, climate change, diet and so many other things take years and years of education and marketing to shift public perception and move the population.

All the while you've got companies with millions pouring in cash to marketing campaigns to shift public perception. Only when governments step in with tax dollars and regulation do these large social changes occur because large groups of people are so susceptible to marketing.
Because it requires conscious effort when people are more concerned about their own lives 
I figured junk food in moderation is a lot more okay than child slavery in moderation.

Junk food is great. Healthy food is also great. I will enjoy eating a shit-tonne of Rolos just s much as I will enjoy eating a nice healthy stir fry. Food is great.
Delicious junk food. If I have 400 calories left at the end of the day, i'll happily sacrifice 200 calories for a bowl of ice cream or a chocolate bar. 


Didn't realize all those Nestle products doctors are prescribing every day are junk.
Support small businesses, grow your own food if you can, vote for people who support fair business practices, and when you do spend, be frugal. It's difficult but not impossible.
That mentality helps. 
You're welcome. I hardly ever use it, but it does come in handy sometimes. 
I don't know, I downloaded it a long time ago, and I have a very old phone, so I don't know what to do about errors. 

Try the app store instead of the website is all I can think of.
Well, I guess we could all be hermits, or only support small businesses.
The site supports animal rights so they don't endorse any nonvegan chocolate, and don't bother researching their human slavery practices.


more importantly, they didn't educate mothers that mixing the formula with anything besides purified water was harmful to their baby.
Also did it in countries without fresh water, so babies died of waterborne diseases. 
That is ingenious....in a totally sociopathic kinda way
Nestle admitted to a scandal back in the day. IIRC they gave poor new mothers in third world countries something like a month sample of free formula claiming it was better for the babies. The mothers used it and after a month needed more formula because they had stopped lactating. So they charged them all for the formula that they now required, which was unnecessary in the first place.  
Tl;dr - Nestle got third world mothers hooked on baby food.

Except packaging, any patents held on the devices that stamp out KitKats, for example. 
Funny how USA is happy to liberate oil rich iraq but can't be added to help child slaves.

That list of products only made me hungrier. I'm not to concerned about who did what to get it on the supermarket shelf. Every day people forced into labor or even killed in order to make the world function like it does. No one on here is bitching about the 8 year old girl making $2 a month to make iPhones. You eat your rolos and enjoy them, they're awesome.  
Conveniently enough, nestle also makes a cake mix. I know what I'm making tonight. Thanks. 
Totally. I find a lot of stuff in real life wouldn't be believable in a movie xD
Was looking for this. There's enough real stuff to criticize Nestl√© for. People don't have to make up shit, it makes it easier for them to dismiss all criticism as stupid and ignorant.
This whole thing is sensationalism. 

Nestle isn't employing child labor either. Farms that produce cocoa, that sales to a company that Nestle buys from were using child labor. There's like 3+ degree of separation. 
Great. Circle jerk ruined. 
So, being salaried in America?
Not true. He states in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOI84pztwV4) that water for hygiene and health is a human right, but water for extraneous, commercial activities like "washing you car" are not a human right. 
Can you link us please?
[deleted]
there really would be no reason for actual nestle in america to knowingly use child slaves. perhaps one of their vendors did they weren't aware of, but the financial benefit is negligible compared to the obvious penalty if caught for an american company.
If it can be shown that Nestle had knowledge that the particular seller was using child slaves, that's a big problem. However, the article is unclear about what exactly Nestle knew about the seller(s). It's possible Nestle didn't know that that seller was using child slaves, nor does the article mention which seller is responsible for such practices or any specifics about the circumstances of these children. 
> In addition, decreasing labor costs reduces the final product's price which is good for consumers. 

I think the final product is priced according to demand for that type of product, not what it costs to make.


> And although this is true, it's also morally abhorrent and doesn't justify slave labor.

And that's why people who love our corporation-dominated economic/political system need to just embrace it.  Just like it's an unnecessary perk to hold a big shareholders meeting at a nice resort, knowing that enslaving black/brown children helped you make *even larger* profits is just a bonus "warm fuzzy" for them.
One of the problems with exposing sub-par water quality standards in the US is that the main "solution" people go to is buying bottled water, which is the most expensive option over time and the worst for the environment. It's better to go with reverse osmosis, a home distiller, or even a few of the gravity filters that actually work, such as ZeroWater. [(Brita doesn't remove all of the lead, for instance).](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-14/news/ct-met-lead-water-filters-20110914_1_filters-cost-osmosis-systems-brita-pitcher) 

If anyone wants background information on US water quality and a description of the various legal issues, see these articles: [1](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html), [2](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/a-toothless-law-on-toxic-chemicals.html), and [3](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?_r=0)

Additionally, the insinuation that Nestle would hire shills seems far fetched, but it really isn't. See /r/shills for factual information on Internet Public Relations. 
I gave up my favorite quick dinner, stoffers french bread.

I gave up my favorite chocolate snack, raisenettes.

I notice just how many bottles of water are supplied by nestle.

I notice how many ice cream treats are made by nestle.

Screw nestle. Boycotting for over a year here.
I would love to see them banned from conducting business in the US for such a blatant disregard for human rights. Politicians always talk about 'sending a message' well nothing would make the message clearer than "If you use slavery (child or otherwise) to conduct your business, you can forget about the US market place."
> Until we start putting executives in jail no corporation is going to give a fuck about human rights.

Exactly. They have too much money to really give a fuck about what happens at their factories or farms. They love to hide behind the "It's a contractor issue and not our farm/factory" argument. It's complete bullshit
If a big company does something bad, worsed thing for them is a fine. The fine itself will be worth less than the money the company made with the crime, but high enough to let the public think that justice was served. Those that know that the fine was not enough are few people and the public won't really care about the issue.

Masses are happy, since the company was fined, company is happy, since the fine was small, and politicians are happy since they can get more donations from nestle. Our world sure is nice.
Why specifically Nestle? Coca Cola has a dodgy human rights record, Unilever has a huge environmental record, Mondelez practiced price fixing...and these are just the first things that came to mind without even googling. Is there any giant you can buy from with a clean conscience? Pepsico, J&J, Mars, Danone, Kellogg's, Associated British Foods, have you researched those and found them to be 'cleaner'? Is it because of a specific thing Nestle did that vastly outweighs the wrongdoings of the other companies or is it some kind of symbolic gesture that's important to you?

I don't mean to belittle that decision in any way, it's more than I do, just curious.
Trying for 6 months now. 

Here's a list of Nestle [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands) to avoid
And as long as that fine is lower than the cost of *not* using child slaves, it's hardly even a punishment, and definitely not a strong motivation for them to stop.
> It's the biggest in its class. That's hard to do.

Another difficulty of boycotting a conglomerate this big is the possibility they may own significant minority stakes of other companies. (For example, my cable company is not Comcast but Comcast owns a 49% share.) Between giant companies and taxes it's really hard to say none of my money goes where I don't want it to go.
I've been boycotting Nestle chocolate for a long time, not for particularly altruistic reasons, but because I think it's crap. This gives me an excuse to boycott the rest of their products. Fortunately, looking at the list, I already don't use very many of their products. The only one I saw that made me sad is H√§agen-Daz. :,( That stuff is delicious...it makes me sad that it's under the Nestle umbrella.
>Feel free to join me.

Oh, I have about 2 years ago already. I seriously wish we could get this news out there more so more people can boycott these pieces of shit. 

Nestle won't stop this otherwise. 
Can yu help provide resources of all their products/main things to avoid. 
Hm. I've been boycotting Nestle without even trying. Neat.
Hmm I already boycott Nestle and I didn't know it!
Neat, I've been boycotting nestle ever since I stopped eating Gerber. 

Now I can really snob it up. 
We need to go the other way.

If all consumers consolidated, bought shares, and staged a hostile takeover, we'd be able to make Nestle do what we wanted. 
Good thing I hate literally every one of those brands already.
Your point is well taken generally, but not in this specific context. It's terrifying that the U.S. should start criminally prosecuting people in other countries for violating U.S. law outside the U.S. 
Why exactly should a CEO of a multinational conglomerate involved in hundreds of different businesses be jailed for the practices of one of the suppliers of one of the businesses in one of its divisions..?  The suppliers/farming businesses should be prosecuted in their home country, but they aren't, because Cote de Ivoire is a shithole and the production was likely state sanctioned or sponsored.

Cote de Ivoire also happens to be the largest producer of cocoa, which is a globally traded commodity similar to coffee in the way that its produced, traded, etc.  Nestle happens to be one of the largest cocoa buyers in the world by volume, and cocoa is a relatively difficult crop to produce/process, constricting the availability of different producing countries.  Nestle likely purchases cocoa from thousands of different individual farmers, smaller brokers, etc since they necessitate so much product.

As an analogy, just look at coffee.  Starbucks is the worlds largest buyer of beans by volume, which means to meet that demand they have to purchase from thousands of different suppliers in brokers in the few countries that successfully harvest Arabica in large enough quantities.  Do some of their producers/producing countries/brokers engage in unethical business/labor practices? Absolutely.  Is it the fault of the Starbucks CEO? Not necessarily.

I hope you aren't naive enough to think that the CEO of a large company actually chooses each supplier or visits these farms, or even conducts due diligence, because they don't.
fuck, you want me to eat healthy or something?
>Until we start putting executives in jail no corporation is going to give a fuck about human rights.

No corporation will EVER give a fuck because a corporation is a legal person that doesn't have a brain or emotions. We don't have to jail executives-- we need the risks of immoral actions to be greater than the rewards. The only reason this kind of behavior is engaged in is because they know the financial risks to be a slap on the wrist compared to the benefit of free labor.
System is corrupt, white collar crime doesn't see the inside of a prison. Especially if they're loaded. Might be time for some vigilante justice if the courts can't get them. 
I remember reading the list and being surprised that I hardly ever bought any Nestle products already. Occasionally I bought dog food from companies under the Nestle umbrella.

My next emotion was disappointment that I couldn't actively boycott more things. Basically I just stopped buying Purina, and now in the office I use milk instead of the nestle coffee creamer they buy.
The tears of slave children make the best garnish.  Although for a true connoisseur the chocolate should be wrapped in fresh quokka skin, changed daily for at least a year.
If its a question of when it was known, that swings through to consumers as well.  Now its been all the way to the Supreme Court, its pretty reasonable that the ‚Äúaverage consumer‚Äù could easily know (the argument for getting *Nestle* in trouble is that they *should have known*, right? So should we prosecute consumers if they bought after it became public knowledge?

We could even choose to selectively prosecute only those who purchased after explicitly learning about the practices in Nestle‚Äôs supply chain - then it would be exactly equivalent to prosecuting Nestle‚Äôs employees for continuing to buy after learning about the use of slave labor (if they did in fact know).
But if the average consumer can claim not knowing about slave labor, so can Nestle's CEO.

The whole point of the discussion is that if companies could be held accountable by things that happen on other parts of the supply chain, they would avoid buying from vendors who have those terrible practices. 


And this very logic can be extended to consumers. Why we never check how the stuff we buy is produced? Because it won't affect us legally.
I had a Kit-Kat this weekend, I am basically Hitler :(
>an American issue

The problem is Nestle's actions don't cause an issue for anyone in America. Americans only benefit from Nestle's actions.
By doing that we're just encouraging companies to do business elsewhere, hurting the US.  We already have stricter labor laws and environmental standards than the vast majority of nations and Americans are still left wondering why companies are flocking to places like China to operate.
Sure they do.  They get their chocolate cheaper from nestle than other conpanies.  Consumers always looking for the cheapest products is what drives the practices of the companies.  The majority of people don't want to pay for a a more realistically priced product or go without something they want. So they go to the lowest common denominator just like the companies supplying the products do.
What about bakeries that buy Nestl√© chocolate chips to make cookies to sell to customers? Or grocery stores that sell Nestl√© products with a markup?
Should we also lock up owners of grocery stores that sell hot pockets? Those are a Nestl√© product and the store wouldn't sell them if they weren't making a profit.

While we're at it, should we be locking up shareholders of Nestl√©? They're profiting...
You and I buy T-shirts knowing they're made in places where the minimum wage is cents per day.  Nestle does the same thing for cocoa and suddenly it's a crime against humanity?  I mean if you want to start assigning blame morally, how about people who eat chocolate?  Ultimately Nestle is just a middleman between the producers and the consumers too.  

Who's responsible for child slavery in Africa?  Your mom.
While you are absolutely correct, that's not what this case is addressing. Nestle did not enslave overseas workers to pick cocoa for it, they just bought cocoa from a trader that used slave labor. The allegation in this case is that they should have known, which is why this case will probably fail like many before it.
It's odd how people criticize Qatar for relying on slave labor and calling their culture barbaric, when so many US companies are relying on slave labor and outsourcing to third world countries with wages so low it may as well be considered slavery.

The hypocrisy.
What about that Green & Blacks stuff you always see in the organic aisles?  They put "fair trade" and "ethically sourced" all over their chocolate, and I hope it's true, because it's pretty damn good:

http://us.greenandblacks.com/about-us#contentTab-6
>almost impossible to buy slave-free chocolate

Sourced from Mali or Ivory Coast, maybe. I don't know enough about the area to tell if it's true or not. 

But sourced from South America, especially Brazil, not at all. The pay isn't like in the US but people aren't slaves. 

It used to be THE place for chocolate, but more and more the companies are turning to different countries with lower prices, because they want it as cheap as possible. But then, oh surprise, you can only force the price to go so low before you find out that scumbags are using slave children to produce said cocoa at such low prices. 

The blame lays for a large part in the people demanding chocolate as cheap as possible instead of paying a bit more for a quality product that doesn't involve enslaving people. 
I'd love to if Google glass wasn't so stupidly expensive, but if there's a phone app I'm willing to be a tester

Edit: made r/nastley for us to use if this goes anywhere
Not sure about other issues, but I have it set to boycott Nestle products, and Nestle happily lists all of their products on their own website. 
No more work than reading the ingredients. Hell, if they made an app that allowed me to scan the barcode and compare the ingredient list against a whitelist of foods I can eat it would actually save me time. 
Almost as much work as harvesting cocoa with tiny fingers.
Only the first couple times.  If you're anything like me you have a list of stuff you buy regularly. 
Ah, ok.  That makes much more sense.  thanks stranger!
I think it's more that people care, but then close reddit and live their lives. Unfortunately, if it's not something that's directly affecting your life it's just difficult to continue thinking about it when the info isn't directly in front of you. It doesn't mean people don't care, it's just how our brains work. That's why when people do care enough, spreading awareness is one of the best things you can do. As long as you're not pushy about it, that just turns people away. 
Tragedy of the commons...
Et tu Hotpockets?
Dammit. Why do they have to own fancy feast? That's like crack for my cat. I'm afraid if I stop feeding Tiger fancy feast shell kill me in my sleep and eat me.
Nestle owns Wonka

Can't blame Wonka for using slave labor of small people then, its corporate culture.
Thanks to that infographic I will never eat Alpo again.
Vichy? The capital of Nazi occupied France? Appropriate. 
>Hot Pockets

***NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***

At least Eggo's isn't there
They own kit kats?

Sorry but no boycott here
Nestle, proud to be one of America's eight companies.
Thanks for this image.  I recommend people save this so if you can't get the app or cant get online while shopping you can still tell what brands they own.
Doesn't barely scratch the surface of what they own.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
Better not lay a finger on my Butterfinger!
The only nestle product I buy is DiGorno. If all the other frozen pizzas didn't suck I could change that. 
It's difficult enough that, were I to use said app, the only things in the supermarket that I'd be able to buy are things it doesn't know about yet.

One thing you didn't mention, though: It's got a barcode scanner. So if your selection of companies is actually manageable, it's a lot easier to use than it sounds. Want pickles? You go stand next to the pickles and scan barcodes until you find a jar of pickles that isn't pickled in children's tears.
Okay, thanks.
this isn't even the worse part, the formula was a powder which required local water to be turned into a drinkable state. The water is very dirty in some areas and so the formula was much more likely to make the infant sick when compared to breast milk.
Do you really think nestle designed their packaging machines?
I wish someone more knowledgeable than me would comment on the credibility and accuracy of that article. 
I second this. 
I was skimming through the thread wondering if everyone is an idiot. Glad I didn't have to go to the bottom. It's all absurd people giving an outcry that people are not living the american dream in other countries.

There is so much more than simply "make sure the managers of foreign countries only hire adults and make sure they are paid the best wages". There is a ton of politics and economy involved and it can't be fixed over night or even the next decade. 

The economy is vastly different in other nations. Over there they either starve to death or do anything required to live. If people start messing in things like this then all people are doing is condemning people to die. But people here don't care as long as things are done properly to their own standards. Pay 1 person $10 doing the work of 10 people and have 9 others starve to death instead of 10 people being paid $1 dollar and living. Then everyone here will be happy. Screw everyone else as long as "you're"(the american public) happy right?
Do not worry. There will be others.
I think it was removed after the water scandal, to clean up his PR.
The fact that water is wasted for things that aren't essential to your survival because it's worth almost nothing to us. In order to prevent water scarcity issues in the future, it needs some kind of value to de-incentivize people from wasting it (lawns, pools, excessive showers). The need for water to not be treated as a free and unlimited resource is a well established idea and necessity if you talk to any water engineer.
> "If something isn't given a value, people tend to waste it. Water is our most useful resource, but those using it often don‚Äôt even cover the costs of its infrastructure. Fresh water is being massively overused at nature‚Äôs expense, but it seems only a global crisis will make us realise the importance of the issue. What is environmentally unsustainable today will become socially unsustainable in the future,"

on the other hand, there's this:
http://www.bottledlifefilm.com/index.php/the-story.html

...It appears that Nestle has a vested interest in water rights/consumption.

He's not talking about how products are priced. He's talking about how cheap child labor will reduce operating costs therefore making the product more affordable to the public.

I recently discovered chocolate covered cranberries. They taste better than raisinettes anyway.
Been about a year for me too! Kit Kats were my biggest loss, but Nestl√© can go fuck off. Makes me sad that people refuse to vote with their wallets, but it's that way for a reason unfortunately. 
Glad to see more people boycotting, I feel so alone and insignificant and sometimes dumb. People that know I boycott Nestle always reinforce this idea that I'm not gonna make a difference, but God damn if I don't try! Cheers to all my fellow companions in the struggle against Nestle.

I gave up San Pelegrino. Which is saying something, because there nothing else like it. 
Basically all of those things are pretty easy to make on your own though. They may just take a little time.

-Old bread from your grocer's bake good section + cheese + homemade tomato sauce = french bread pizza. Make in advance and freeze. This can be done super cheaply if you watch for sales on tomatoes, cheese, and french/italian bread. Usually about 2-3 dollars for everything if you time it right, and that will give you 4-6 big chunks of pizza.

-Dip raisins in chocolate for raisenettes. Plus you can make as many as you want, using whatever chocolate you want.

-Instead of bottled water, use Tap water, or charcoal filtered water in a water bottle.

-For ice cream, Google "alton brown vanilla ice cream" and go to your local goodwill and get a donvier ice cream maker for 3-5 dollars. This could actually be pricier than buying store bought though, if you're used to the $2.50 half gallons of "frozen dairy dessert" that are 40% air by volume. This will produce something more like fancy gelato, or something like "super premium" ice cream like ben and jerrys.

I suppose I boycott most of the mass-marketed food industry without really intending to. My wife and I just cook all of our own food, save for some stuff like chemical leaveners, condiments, and bullion.
 The water is very difficult, I don't wish to buy tap water in a bottle, and while combing through all the labels I realized I only have one option that's not Nestle and not tap water.  The spring water I used to buy turned out to be nestle in one of its hundreds of different labels.

I buy Super Chill, a generic brand out of PA, natural spring water, not fucking Nestle.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands) and such.

I'm so pissed they bought out the maker of my cat's food - Organix by Castor & Pollux. This is the kink in the armor of my strong and long boycott of Nestl√©. I tried switching my cats to several other high quality grain free foods, but they boycotted all of them and went on hunger strikes even with me trying to slowly introduce it. So I still buy the food begrudgingly. At least it is still being manufactured by the founders, but it really annoys me.

I want a law that states all products must disclose their parent company somewhere on the label. There are tons of people who think they're boycotting Nestle when in reality, much of the "alternatives," are owned by Nestl√©.
I boycott many companies just by being frugalish.
Thanks dude(tte)!
You don't want to hear this but your boycott is essentially useless and has no significant effect, but as long as you're happy..
Nike, most foreign clothes manufacturers, diamonds, electronics and I could go on, use child labor as well. Where's their day in court? Nestle screwed up and is evil but plenty of American creature comforts are also the product of cheap, young labor too. Probably the phone or computer you are typing on was made by a child.

No more Haagen Daz for me.  :(
Damn.  They own Haagen Daz?

Sacre bleu.  Oh well, thanks for the heads up.
For chocolate bars I like Theos. I just get Talenti and Publix brand for ice cream. It becomes a bit harder for more specialty items...if I absolutely need hot chocolate Wawa or Starbucks or whatever...but yeah fuck Nestle.
They own everything and now I'm sad.

If the CEO faces a legal danger for the action of his subordinates, then the CEO might focus on improving company culture and making sure nothing illegal is going on. If we continue to not hold companies accountable and let their constituents play the plausible deniability game, we'll never get them to behave properly.
As someone who lives in in that "shithole", I agree with most of this: there are many levels of buyers and agents and logistics companies between Nestle and farmers, but that does not absolve them of responsibility. Cocoa farmers are exploited, and the consumers power that. Of course the government sanctions this, because it brings in foreign currency and keeps their rural poor voting base busy with cash-crop farming.

Hershey and Nestle are among the worst.
I agree with you in spirit, but McDonalds might be a better example than Starbucks. Starbucks has extensive programs in place regarding the sourcing of its coffee and regularly visits its suppliers. There are books written on the topic because it is so unusual for a large company to care that much, from what i understand. Anyways carry on...
Nice try Nestle. Your reasonable argument isn't fooling anyone
What a corporation lacks is a conscience, which is basically what you said.

We have a word for a person without a conscience.
Grats, it sounds like you may have good eating habits.
I actually only came into the comments to figure out why the *legal* burden falls on Nestle, exactly. Moral I get, sure. But I'm curious to know how a law is written that punishes a buyer for the wrongdoing of its supplier, and where the line is drawn.

Now that I'm aware, does purchasing Nesquick make me a criminal? If so, then consider me an outlaw.
I know now, and will buy nestle tomorrow.  
Gib mir eine break, Kitler. 
What would Nestle's profits look like if they stopped operating in the US? It's a symbiotic relationship
Not only that, but you can now no longer say that you are doing so without knowing what is going on. 
I'm sure if the box said cheap coco, child labor sourced, people would be less inclined to purchase it. At some point nestle, as the buyer, had to know where they were getting their product. Is there no moral accountability or is everything just reducible to want and demand and therefore there is no culpability on any side?  I believe Nestle should be held liable. We can't go after the slavers short of invading their country but we can make at least a token attempt to go after corrupt business practice. 
Nah, people would rather push the blame onto the corporations despite them buying products from those same corporations. 
Nestle isn't a US company. They're swiss I believe. 
? I think outsourcing to third world countries at that countries market wage could only be good for that labor market.
Nestley isn't even American why don't you take your agenda and shove it up your beep so maybe we can have a factual discussion here
If it means anything, which it rarely does, "fair trade" refers to how you treat the farmers, not their farm hands. And "ethically sourced" means nothing without stating whose ethics are being used to make the judgement.
It'll probably be a few years for this to really be viable, although I suppose a lesser smart phone version might be possible.

Funny - I was boycotting them and I didn't even know it! (Well I actively don't buy their water, on the rare occasion I do want bottled water.) Although I sort of want a Butterfinger now...

Ninja Edit: I do use coffeemate occasionally at work, but I'm not buying that anyway. I'm not gonna bring in my own creamer just to not use them.
If you are in the US it is owned/made by Hersey's, everywhere else it is Nestle.  
Not sure where you live but in the US they're owned by Hershey (not sure how that works exactly). 
afaik fair trade guarantees that the producer (owner of the farm) gets paid, but it does nothing to guarantee that the employees of the owner get paid. Further evidenced by the huge abuse of children at cocoa farms.
What an ignorant and simplistic way to solve a problem. 

> I don't like child labor. Let's make it illegal and the root problem will be solved!! They'll go to school and become engineers or take on some welfare!! Im now giving my business to a company employing an American man, you can thank me later Iqbal!
Even today the line between child labor and the family helping out on a family owned farm is very thin in America. You check out schools near farming communities and the absences near harvest time is gonna be huge. 
Ah the good old right to be forgotten...
and hes saying it wont because a reduction in cost to produce usually goes into profit margins if the product is already selling fine at a pricepoint. 

There is zero motivation to adjust price on production costs if more people buying < lost $ from existing customers paying lower.

Thus the price won't change and the product will not be more affordable. The company will simply make better margins on each individual sale. 
Chocolate covered coffee beans all the way!
This is true for most of Nestle's products. I haven't purchased anything with a Nestle logo on it for over a year. The few times I've tasted something of theirs, it usually tastes worse than the competitor I've switched to. And their competitors are rarely more expensive. 

Besides the "evil corporation" thing, their products are generally a lower quality. I really don't miss them. 

(Except for Kit-Kats. Fuck I miss buying them whenever I want. Got a shitload for Christmas and I'm savoring the shit out of them.)
[deleted]
Kit Kats in the United States are Hershey, not Nestle.  
People aren't refusing! They *are* voting. They're voting for Nestle.
I think it is too much to ask of the ordinary citizen, that they have to sift through unimaginable amounts of information, in order to be able to make simple purchases at the store. And honestly I don't think people should be asked to shoulder such a burden. I would rather parents played with their children, than read about Nestl√© off brands on Wikipedia, but maybe that is just me.

Besides this very practical limitation to voting with your wallet, you are in effect asking the free markets to fix all the problems of the free markets themselves (which I find to be ironic, and paradoxical) - I would rather see the state step up and make some (good and sound) decisions for it's populace. We used to be able to buy leaded gasoline, but it was not voting with your wallet that changed that, but government implemented regulation.
Huh, I just realized I was accidentally boycotting Nestle's brands while purposefully boycotting their water!

Reading through the list was going well (just gotta give up digiorno) until I got to pet food. They own everything...
Try [Gerolsteiner.](http://www.gerolsteiner-usa.com/home.html)
I love how a thread on boycotting corporations turned into a recip√© compilation. 
Last time this topic came up heaps of people posted about how they would like to boycott Nestle but it was literally impossible to do so given all the brands they own. I looked through the list and discovered that I was already boycotting Nestle. All I did was not buy junk foods...
What is so bad about tap water?
[deleted]
Have you considered getting tap water out of a tap? In most of the US it's perfectly safe. Flint Michigan notwithstanding 
It's better to just forgo bottled water in general. Get a filter or just drink tap water straight, if you're in the US that shouldn't ever be a problem. If your tap water tastes off its probably chlorine in which case then putting it in a pitcher in the fridge for a bit will help. 
Get a water filter. There's a few options so you can choose what suits you best. There's pitchers, water tanks (box with a spout), or some that attach to your faucet. The good points of the pitcher or "tank" types are that they can easily be stored in the fridge if you want some cold drinking water. The faucet type makes it easy to use filtered water for drinking, cooking or whatever.

Also, a fridge with a water dispenser will usually have a filter on it. It's also usually chilled water.
That's a good point. However, one person CAN make a difference by discretely contaminating  random Nestle products on store shelves using a hypodermic needle filled with a mild sickening agent such as capsacin or ipecac!
No single snowflake feels responsible for the avalanche.
Gotta start somewhere, and Nestle is one of the biggest culprits. 

Nike should be next. The tech companies that take advantage of low-paying child labor in China and elsewhere need to be held accountable. But we have to start with someone, and punishing Nestle in what is arguably the most powerful court on earth would set an incredible precedent that could stop everyone else. 

It's a super slow process but starting with Nestle is as ideal a company to punish for this as anyone else.

Just checked with Google -- Sounds like my phone manufacturers are trying to stop it at their facilities.
Diamonds aren't even rare, or particularly useful for common purposes.  If you like shiny, there's shinier, prettier minerals out there.  Their price is inflated beyond necessity and the demand is basically manufactured by the DeBeers cartel.
nestle has done more; they re-sold poison products that were recalled in US markets in 3rd world countries, and basically scammed African mothers into being entrapped with formula feeding even in areas they knew the water used would hurt babies. they are MONSTERS.
Nike has already been to court but nothing really ever happened to them just like what's going to happen with Nestle.
The difference is whether or not the child gets paid 
That's why boycotting  and fining or even jailing individual companies or executives is not enough.  We need to change the entire way humans currently work if we ever want justice .
I can commiserate with your cynicism, but its not quite true. People still have their vote and until voter apathy turns around these loose canon politicians will do whatever they want because they know that voters simply don't care. Money is a powerful force, this is true, but informed votes are stronger, as the government recognizes votes not dollars when changing power.  

Perhaps it's too hopeful (and maybe a little naive) to presume that a united population is stronger than corporate dollars. But it's better than throwing your hands up in the air and saying violent revolution is the **only** way to restore our country.


> Until they do something about Citizens United

You mean like give the very same corrupted congress that we're upset about MORE power to regulate political spending?  

I want money out of politics more than anyone, but the Udall amendment and similar proposals have plenty of potential to make existing problems even worse. 

If you look at money in politics as a market, you see we are only looking at the demand side (i.e. corporations wanting to buy laws).  If you instead restrict the supply side (politicians selling laws), not only is the legislation much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint, it might actually work. 

In other words, make it impossible for politicians to sell influence, don't try to make it impossible to buy.  The black market for legislation will be 1000x easier to manage than e.g. the black market for drugs.  There are only a few thousand politicians in the US and we can make them all submit to constant surveillance, etc. 
Exceptions prove the rule.

It's just one of the exceptions, most of the time it's just a fine smaller than the money they made or nothing at all.
I do the ice cream ordering for the store I work at, and at least at my place, nestle I'd more of a minority in terms of orders. They're often much more expensive or worse quality than the other products I order, and the space they fill could be taken up by a lot of different ice cream products I'd like to order.I dunno though, the customers really want some of them, and just outright removing big names like Hagen Dazs and drumstick from my shelves would hardly be something I can do without customers complaining at me.
Talenti mango gelato is the best thing I've ever had
You basically have to stop bottled water, which is bad anyway, because nestle controls most of that.
I just have to stop buying ice cream drumsticks and Wonka candy (which I don't buy all that often in the first place) and I'm already boycotting Nestle.
Most of its products don't say Nestle on them. 
Child slaves.

Fuck it, why don't we just buy up these child slaves, ship them over here, and make them work directly on social welfare programs...? Cut out the middle-man.

Nice priorities there, Candie...
And then watch the little factory kids starve right? 
UK student studdying Law,

It is very rare for a company to be held responsible for the actions of companies it owns, it is much less likely to be held accountable for one of a company it has no control of. Calling for legal sanctions against the CEO is absolutely ridiculous, and would deter any CEO from applying, let alone attracting any good CEO.
No doubt that it doesn't absolve them, I just think that the notion of prosecuting management of large holding companies is insanely unrealistic (something others here fail to understand).

The much more likely solution would be for the local government to identify the exploitative elements and punish the corp financially for dealing with them.  
Also, Starbucks doesn't compete on price so it is able to demand a fair wage for the employees of its suppliers. It chooses to do so which is due to ethical, moral management. However...

A public company like McDonalds or Nestle that competes on price on a global stage? They would be crazy NOT to use slave labor if it's available. Remember: they aren't ethical beings. They are publicly traded corporations, machines for making money. They are psychopathic, amoral, inhuman. 

Giving those psychos the ability to affect US elections is the greatest legal failure of our generation. SCOTUS should be ashamed. 
Not as good as they could be, but enjoying cooking and having disposable income definitely helps.
From what I can tell, the legal issue is pretty tied up in technical considerations about the jurisdiction of US laws in foreign countries and other minutia.

The moral question is the interesting one for me though. We are all the end consumers of these commodities, how much responsibility *should* we have to investigate the supply line to ensure we are not supporting this kind of human right abuse. If we say that we *aren‚Äôt* responsible for avoiding the knowledge of abuse in our own ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù, can we morally hold Nestle responsible for essentially doing the same thing in theirs?
bingo. We lazy apes don't want to do the research involved or pay the $$$ for well sourced shit. much easier to blame.

"In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestl√©, owners of the Rowntree brand."

I think Nestl√© gets part of the profit, not sure.
False.  Without analyzing the financial details, you can assume that lowering of costs go into both profits and price by following equilibrium.  The incentive is they are able to sell more quantity at a lower price to produce higher total profit.  Higher margins aren't the only profitable path.
I find that hard to believe
I don't think nestle products are inelastic.
I can eat like one before I'm done though.
Uh-oh...hope those coffee beans arent harvested by slaves too.
Why have I never heard of these?!? 
Chocolate covered chocolate!
Chocolate covered chocolate is better 
(Found out that Hershey makes Kit Kat in the US, and Nestle makes it everywhere else in the world. Makes sense now)
San pelligrino is the only one I cant find a replacement for, I love limonatas.
Yup, that's definitely what they're doing. In fact, it makes a lot of sense. 

When you invest money in the stock market, the most important rule is to diversify your assets. Don't put all your money in Apple stock. Put a little bit in Apple stock, and a little in Google, and a little in this and that and this and that. That's literally the first rule of investing. It's actually difficult to invest your own money in one company; investment firms will set up accounts that diversify your money automatically. 

That's what Nestle's been doing for decades, but with food brands rather than stocks. Buy all the good brands so that if one tanks, or one becomes unpopular, or one has an infection scandal, or if one gets really bad press, it won't have a serious effect on the company's bottom line. 

I've been boycotting them for a year but I miss Kit-Kats so fucking much. I got a whole bunch for Christmas and I've been savoring them slowly because I didn't buy them so I don't feel so guilty. 
This man knows his chocolate. I think the U.S is the only country due to that copywrite/patent issue.
As pointed out by /u/UTubeCommentRefugee Hershey [isn't much better](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/30/lawsuit-your-candy-bar-was-made-by-child-slaves.html)

Basically the sole reason most companies have power and money is that people trade it to them for some perceived convenience. In a lot of these cases though, the convenience isn't even real, or the drudgery it was meant to replace was conjured.

If you want to fight corporations, start by not giving them money. Make stuff for yourself.

Usually, nothing.  It's regulated more heavily than bottled water (EPA vs. FDA, IIRC)
[deleted]
I think it's the idea of paying for something that is technically free (you pay for tap water in your water bill and taxes). We think that just because it's "regular old tap water," we're getting swindled. 

However, in the case of most bottled water, the only thing that you are paying for is the convenience of purchasing cold water in a container that you can carry around for a while. Even if the bottled water that you purchase is not technically tap water, it will not necessarily be any "better" than tap water (unless you live in a place with really shitty tap).
Depends on where you are. I'm in Lima, Peru, and there are sometimes signs on faucets that say, "Do not drink!", you have to buy bottled water, and unfortunately there are a few Nestlƒì brands
Just don't live in Flint Michigan
But, think of the children! (who eat the chocolates, not the slave ones)
With chinese labor, its a bit more difficult [due to China producing 95% of the world's Rare Earth Metals, which are used in electronics](http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/054/690/i02/rare-earth-minerals-infographic-110228a.jpg?1373487621) so if China says 'Nope, we're not shipping raw materials,' you're kinda boned.
Sort of hijacking a top post, but this whole thread has me wondering about the recent corporate legal developments with the right of corporations to deny class action suits and have courts enforce individual arbitration (at which point the vast majority of plaintiffs give up). There are even things sprouting up like debt collectors fraudulently suing over unenforceable debts while at the same time banning counter-suits by having courts enforce arbitration again and ordering people to pay.       

So if this is going on around the country and only getting worse, what real hope is left to set any precedent for Nestle or a similar corporation to deter this kind of behavior? Other than economic sanctions, or other big players organizing, regular citizens seem absolutely powerless against companies like this even when truth gets out about their actions.     

What point is there in demanding accountability when that very demand becomes more onerous than any kind of oversight our government should be doing?
The customers buying the stuff are the culprits. I'm sure if you look through the cupboards and closets of many here, myself included, you'll find much evil, to which a blind eye is turned.
agreed, i hate when someone lists off a bunch of others doing the same as if its okay but i mean do u expect 100% of the culprits to be obliterated in one move?
I can't believe that it took me this long to the conclusion that **ALL** companies are fucking scum entirely.
I always try to explain this to people and they either dont believe me about DeBeers or justify their obsession with some social status quo bs. It annoys me beyond belief.

You get to vote for, guessing here, Hilary Clinton the war monger or, pick a republican nut bar.

Not much of a choice.  I expect Hillary will be the next pres., at least that's where I would put my money.  

Aside from that, you are right, informed votes are stronger, but most people get their information from corporate media.  Bernie Sanders would be a better choice for a Dem IMHO, but even though he clearly beat Clinton in debate the corporate media hailed Clinton the winner.  How many people do you think watch the debate vs. the number of people that believe what big media tells them?

What is hopeful is the concept of a united population.  A lot of corporate dollars are spent in efforts to divide the population.

I didn't say it was the only way.  I said it was the only way aside from striking down Citizens United.

I don't know if it makes sense to talk about people "having" a vote when they'll believe literally anything, no matter how contradictory to reality or simply nonsensical, as long as it aligns with certain personal convictions or fears of theirs.  E.g. trump talking about 1000s of muslims dancing in the streets.  Never happened.  And yet there are people who will vote on the sole basis of Trump talking about that non-event that didn't happen. 

On the other side (to avoid downvotes) anti-vaxxers who continue to ignore basic arithmetic to maintain the fantasy that vaccines are a deadly conspiracy aimed at their infants? 

In that world, what kind of "voting" are we really talking about? 
The vote doesn't matter if your only choices are Tweed's candidates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE
I boycott bottled water across the board anyway.  The only reasons I'll ever buy one is if I need the container or I'm stuck and absolutely need water.
Exactly, that's how accountability works. You make in more painful to not comply so their incentive shifts from not giving a fuck, because wrist slaps don't really hurt, to giving a really big fuck if they want to do business in civilized society.  Plenty of companies in regulated industries have compliance departments and manage to stay within the law, Nestle doesn't get to claim unique incompetence as a reason to do wrong.
Very true.

My pessimistic view is that the only change can come from the lowest levels, but virtually everyone with a stake in the cocoa value chain will keep the system as exploitative as possible. Regional governments are involved in moving cocoa, and "local" governance is intentionally kept powerless. Plus the fact that multiple countries compete to grow the most cocoa doesn't help.
Although H√§agen-Dazs is American, so it's not a clear giveaway. 
Wienerschnitzel is American though.

When things sound foreign we Americans tend to think it must somehow be better. 
A little blood too, their tiny little wounds don't heal up as good when they aren't paid enough to eat real food.
Yeah, if it's under license, Nestle would still get paid. 

The chocolate is probably sourced from south america, which is nice, but Nestle still makes some money off it.
I once had to stay up all night and I have my ps3 and a 2lb bag of chocolate coffee beans for company. I munched on them the whole night and when the sun came up I was sitting there in a feverish caffine induced hallucination with my mind not functioning but continuing to get the highest scores of my life on destiny.

>I've been boycotting them for a year but I miss Kit-Kats so fucking much.

Sounds like what you need is some sort of non-Nestle Kit-Kats. Anyone have an idea what subreddits might know that sort of thing?
Yeah, the price is what has kept me from trying other foods, along with not knowing how big the difference in quality is. Like, if it's the difference between iceberg and romaine I don't care honestly, but if it's the difference between a normal diet and a diet of straight burger king then I do.

That site seems to sell the same sorts of crappy brands as well. Do you have any recommendations for cat food? I feed my cat friskies pate because I heard it was the best of the worst.
The flavor is what's wrong in certain places. While the water in DC and Florida won't kill you, it is the most disgusting tasting stuff on earth. Tastes like swamp water. 

In NYC i'll drink the tap all day long though.

*edit*

Just a reminder that taste is subjective and while I may find something disgusting, others may love it. 
[deleted]
I agree that buying bottled tap water is a little silly but it seems like the person I was responding to didn't give actual tap water a serious thought.

Yea, I generally don't do tap abroad unless I've read it is ok and confirmed with the locals. 

These concerns are generally not founded in the US and if they are, people need to do something about it and make their water clean (should be done abroad too but idk how acheivable that is).
That doesn't mean that you can't send representatives to make sure that the factories you're using are all above board.

The flip side being that your product's price will go up and unless you're Apple (and, to an extent, even then) or a true vanity brand, consumers will migrate away from your products for being relatively expensive.
Actually rare earth elements are not that rare. Japan has large offshore concentrations and we also have larve amounts. We just don't mine it due to cost and environment. So China can hold it above us but not for a long time.
It's only because they have little in the way of regulation in how they treat their people or their environment, so it's cheaper than anywhere else.  Most rare earth metals aren't that rare.  They're just difficult and expensive to extract in an environmentally acceptable way.
I love how that chart has nothing in Africa. Largest land mass out there and nothing there? Or is it just because there is no telling with the fact that Africa is a political mess?
You ship me rare earth metals right now, and make our shit or you get zero oil. 

I'll be right here.
The US also has rare earth metal reserves. We just do not exploit them very much because Chinese prices would make it hard for US-based rare earth metal producers to compete. Plus, China has less concern for the environmental hazards of rare earth metal production. That being said, I do not believe our reserves or as great as China's.

[Found a map showing rare earth metal reserves around the world.](http://energy.gov/maps/estimated-rare-earth-reserves-and-deposits)
Rare earth minerals are all over, but mostly only extractable by creating a lot of pollution, so we get them from china. Early last year I read how investors were looking to build in another countries since china has been losing a lot of it's low-cost benefits. 

So it may not be true for much longer.
>So if this is going on around the country and only getting worse, what real hope is left to set any precedent for Nestle or a similar corporation to deter this kind of behavior?

So that TPP business you may have heard about will almost undoubtably bring on more cases like this. (I do not mean that condescendingly! MANY people do not know of the passing of the TPP or are unaware of the nitty, gritty batshit crazy details involved in that heinous deal).  Although this is clearly partisan, I think it is a great article to explain how the TPP ties into this and future law suits...[Bernie Sanders paper about why he was against the passing of the TPP](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file)


Slightly less biased, but another video about TPP from *before* it was passed. [Hereeeee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC1mqyAXmw)
You're not wrong, but keep in mind that most consumers simply don't know that this is going on. Nestle undoubtedly knows about their effects on their workers and they definitely know that they're using child labor. 

That doesn't let their customers off the hook, but the ones who know about the problem and let it continue are at least as bad. 
A company does its best to operate in an amoral fashion. Not immoral, amoral. It's like when somebody tries some machine learning by having a computer try to beat Mario. It just hacks and bashes at the system until it achieves the win state it's mindlessly programmed to achieve. If that means it does something you might call cheating, so be it. Only the win state matters.

A company is not a computer of course. It's more of a crowd sourced hivemind, and the only win state it rewards is more profit. Everything else is fail. So it hacks and bashes at the system until that makes the profit number go up. Nobody turns the profit making hivemind off, though. It just keeps hacking and bashing trying to make the number go up. Anti-slavery laws are in the way of the win state. More hacking and bashing until it squirms around the blockage and gets the profit number to rise. 

Since a company is made of people, it's not really amoral, but the morality of its populace is a kind of average, plus everybody in the company feels like it's someone else's fault. You end up with a body that has the morals of a 500 foot tall toddler screaming endlessly for more cookies no matter how many cookies it gets.

And you know who keeps giving it cookies? You do. I do. We all do. Worse, if a company takes a moral stand, the other company just doesn't, makes all the money, buys that company, and erases the moral stand. It hacks and bashes mindlessly at the system until the number goes up. It buys Congress. It does any and everything to make the number go up. That's just what business does, because it's made out of people precisely as evil as you are, and all they get paid for is for making the number go up. Any regulation is just a momentary slowing of its constant demand that the number goes up. Successful regulation in one country just causes a switch of venue to a different nation where there is no regulation. Hack, bash, and squirm. 

It's no good to talk about making it less profitable to cause suffering. Suffering will always be more profitable than the alternatives. At best you can encourage a company to locate its suffering somewhere else. 

It's no good to take an individual stand, not when the majority of the humans will refuse to take the same stand if it merely inconveniences them, to say nothing of when that stand would really cost them something. 

As long as the problem is made of people, the problem will persist. You are the problem. I am the problem. We are the problem. The only real solution to the problem is a gamma burst from space that wipes out all human life. 

It's one of the many reasons I'm not interested in bearing children. Fuck making more of these pests.

Oh gee, where have I heard that before? Bloody *everywhere*.
Vote for Bernie in the primary and we get someone who will fight the good fight.
Well said. I've personally stopped watching network news outside of a favorite local channel. The problem with network news is that it is narrated to be entertaining, much like professional wrestling. The winner has already been chosen because the script (for the news) had been written. Plus many media personalities have had intimate relationships with the Clintons through the decades so there must be some level of bias in the punditry that goes on (at least on the Dem side, dont even get me started about the GOP). Though I would argue that anyone who uses CNN, Fox, MSNBC as a primary source isn't an 'informed voter' at all.  

This whole presidential election for the news networks are just a huge, huge money grab, not only because of the extra exposure from having presidential candidates on the network, but also from election spending and advertisements. Which is why its a 2 year 24/7/365 topic that just rolls into the next cycle. I remember when Obama was first elected in December 2008ish, before he even took office, CNN was going on about the 2010 and 2012 elections. It never ends. Which makes me think they have an incentive to keep Citizens United on the books as if it were to go away, there would be a lot less election money for ads. (/tinfoilhat).
It should really be outlawed, it's harmful in so many ways.
Legal sanctions for CEOs is absolutely the wrong way of going about this.

Perhaps larger fines/things which affect the trading of the company. This would make shareholders put pressure on the companies not to do this sort of trading. This will certainly happen in this case! Watch the share price drop, and some directors/CEOs jobs be threatened.
Someone else mentioned the type of sustainability measures adopted by Starbucks in a reply to my post.  I think that until consumers hold producers accountable for deciding against fair-trade like they do in the coffee-market, it will likely continue as you described.  A fair-trade program could give all parties a vested interest because fair-trade readily sells for more at the end-user level (it does in the case of other commodities like coffee at least)

I'm curious what steps could be adopted to try and make that type of cultural change with cocoa, since fair-trade and other programs have made a huge difference in coffee production worldwide.
Wiener Schnitzel isn't American. It's even in the name: "Wien" is the capital of Austria.

Countries in the developing world have very lax or nonexistent labor laws and only recently have supply chains in the developed world started caring about slavery and human trafficking.

Most electronics sold in the US that aren't Shanzhai specials already have auditing in place from the mine to end user to ensure no slavery or human trafficking was used.  Only recently did food and consumer goods like clothes start getting this treatment as well.

I lived in Boston, DC, Pasadena... the tap waters all tasted different, but all perfectly fine. I never felt in the slightest that I was drinking "swamp water". I'm not doubting your personal perceptions, I just wanted to offer an anecdotal counterpoint. 
Higher sulfur content due to marshlands. Same problem in some deep south states. 
May well be, depends where he lives. But if he's in a developed country with fine drinking water than he's an idiot.
I agree! I think most people don't think about it much. They just assume that tap water is lower quality and/or they don't want to pay for something that they can already get "free."
All major companies do this already. There is a documentary about Nokia, an early adopter of corporate social responsibility, trying to go through its whole supply chain to make sure everything is above board. Unfortunately what they found is that often the Chinese factories keep two sets of books and generally lie about following regulations since there is no domestic punishment for them.
Not if it's the only option.
I'm not sure that reps ever listen to me... at least about most things. =<
While they're not rare, its more about production than scarcity.
100% agree, thanks for a good Bernie post 
> The only real solution to the problem is a gamma burst from space that wipes out all human life.

Irrationally cynical view there.  The real solutions are in technology and oversight, and they do work wonders.  The working conditions and overall health and wealth metrics (of areas where such concepts like tripartism are employed) are astounding compared to every previous period of human history or modern counter-example.

The economic human condition is not simply a repeatable set of animalistic outcomes, but more of an orchestra that follows a conductor.  It's really a socially constructed environment.  There are no laws of physics that bind the corporate and financial worlds to their behavior.  Just social norms distilled by loudmouths overhearing the works of a few scribblers from ages past.
is this a result of our current system somehow? i feel like (although i know next to nothing about the way this works) the current laws governing corporations and the creation of large companies effectively forces manufacturers to become one of these amoral entities.

somehow, i think our current state is not simply an inevitable result of human nature. instead, it seems like something went horribly wrong somewhere in history, creating this sort of feedback loop that's sort of amplified the competitive mentality to insane levels. 

that said, advances in artificial intelligence will also likely bring an end to this problem, one way or another. 
Unfortunately operating amorally in pursuit of profit means that they're a bunch of greedy sons of bitches.
Hail the socialist!
Okay, I can get on board with that but the fines need to be considerably more painful than what we see now.  The penalties need to be several factors higher than the revenue generated from violating the rules, to shift the incentive away from committing the acts to not.  How about we ban companies from the US marketplace for a period of time, say 5 years.  Think of it like the proverbial "death sentence" that the NCAA will do sometimes to athletic programs that commit serious violations.  They will freeze that programs recruitment abilities for a few years to the point that it effectively makes them non competitive and lose a ton of money.  You can argue who that really ends up hurting as it relates to the NCAA, but the level of fear that instills is pretty palpable.  We have no such incentives in place for corporations, not anywhere close to that level.  If CEO's aren't going to have skin in the game along the lines of criminal charges, then the companies need to be on the hook for some seriously overwhelming fiscal penalties as an alternative.
Sure, Fair Trade that will be part of the solution [but it's never a clear story](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee). Fair trade is small portion of coffee production, and not all non-fair trade coffee is unethically produced.

"Fair Trade is a joke!" - my own conversations with cocoa transporters. Lots of bullshit corporate greenwashing measures right now with free bicycles and child nutrition programs. It's a complex problem and surely FT-esque initiatives will be part of the solution.
[Wiener Schnitzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Schnitzel) (Two words) is indeed a real Austrian/German Food.

[Wienerschnitzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wienerschnitzel) (one word) is an American restaurant chain that sells mostly hot dogs and is an entirely incorrect usage of the word, and they don't even sell actual wiener schnitzel last time I was there.



The name was chosen because it sounded better than "John's Hot dogs" and the founder likely didn't even know what it meant, only that it had a resemblance to the American definition of wiener (hot dog/sausage).

Well water in Florida can be kinda fizzy (and kinda funky) until the hydrogen sulfide has a chance to escape.
By Chinese and USGS estimates China has between 45 and 55% of current known global REE. China has been dominating the REE market simply because they can and do mine it more cheaply than the other countries with large deposits (which includes the US; see the Mountain Pass mine in California). Whenever China starts to reduce their REE production, other countries, including the US, pick up the slack fairly rapidly.
>I think our current state is not simply an inevitable result of human nature. instead, it seems like something went horribly wrong somewhere in history...

Who wrote the history?

It's not like there is some hardcoded message of "evil, greed, destruction" in our blood. It's just that we are all drifting along, improvising as we go. We merely ended up here, but we have no one to blame for that but ourselves.

We are a somewhat intelligent form of life. We can learn and we can evolve but we won't learn until learning is the last available option.
Not a human nature, just nature at work. Life is based on competition for resources, down to the tiniest organism. In a competition, someone will be up top and someone will be on the bottom. Living with first world comforts require others to live in poverty.

He's not the CEO of Nestle, he's the CEO of one of its many many subsidiaries: Nestl√© Waters North America
All this hate for Nestle when they use .008% of the water supply is the reason things will never get better. People want a big corporate name to be the problem because rethinking how we use agriculture is a daunting task
What's the difference between the drinking water they sell and the drinking water that is used to make the soda that is sold right next to  it on the shelf? 

So if Nestle were to put a bunch of sugar and colors in it and market it to your children, you would all be okay with it?

And what about the soda you buy at restaurants? It's made with tap water as well. The soda comes to the restaurant as a syrup and is mixed with tap water and CO2 by the soda fountain.
Your enemy is the *agricultural sector* people

edit: tons of excellent responses below that I definitely recommend reading to get a more balanced picture of the situation. I have gone too far in describing them as your "enemy" (they do feed a lot of people, after all), but I still believe that there are vast improvements regarding water usage to be made in the agricultural industry.

edit 2: Here's a short [summary](http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=1108) from The Public Policy Institute of California, to give a very basic overview of water usage in the State.

edit 3: /u/giveupitscrazy posted these [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/35wc08/nestle_ceo_tim_brown_on_whether_hed_consider/cr8vam9?context=3), which I thought were definitely worth seeing for an alternate point of view; they certainly helped to enlighten me. The response as a whole to my original comment has been humbling, and I think it's fantastic to see so many people are engaged and opinionated on this issue!
... Because he realizes the water he bottles is almost 100% used for drinking and is of a trivial amount? 

edit: 

**HOW HAS NOBODY REFERENCED THIS?**
https://youtu.be/Y3iEgKjh3Nk
Bottled water companies don't sell water. They sell *convenience*. It really is one of the greatest business success stories of all time.
It costs $0.15-0.25 a gallon to get filtered water at coin operated refill stations in my area. Like many have said, most bottled water is simply filtered tap water. I don't why more people don't use these things.
"Yeah, it's that evil corporate guy!" Never mind the "organic" farms that take more water to grow the same yield.
People should stop buying it. Its not any better than what comes out of your tap.
but if the water is being used as drinking water, where is the actual harm?

It's not like he's pouring it down a drain....
The last post that tried to vilify Nestle someone correctly pointed out how much water is wasted on golf courses, CA has 1100 of them.  So if you hate Nestle, you're literally  going after the drop in the bucket.
Who cares???  This water bottling has no measurable effect on the water shortage.  It's like you need to fill a swimming pool so you go and complain about a person taking water away in an eye dropper.
From what I have read, it really doesn't matter. [Here](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/) is a pretty awesome summary of where California's water goes.
It turns out Nestle's water usage in California is [beyond irrelevant.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/) The media has gotten to your heads... again.

>Since numbers like these are hard to think about, it might be interesting to put them in a more intuitive form. The median California family earns $70,000 a year ‚Äì let‚Äôs take a family just a little better-off than that who are making $80,000 so we can map it on nicely to California‚Äôs yearly water income of 80 million acre-feet.

>Apparently we are also supposed to be worried about Nestle bottling water in California. ABC News writes an article called Nestle Needs To Stop Bottling Water In Drought-Stricken California, Advocacy Group Says, about a group called the ‚ÄúCourage Campaign‚Äù who have gotten 135,000 signatures on a petition saying that Nestle needs to stop ‚Äúbottling the scarce resource straight from the heart of California‚Äôs drought and selling it for profit.‚Äù Salon goes even further ‚Äì their article is called Nestle‚Äôs Despicable Water Crisis Profiteering: How It‚Äôs Making A Killing While California Is Dying Of Thirst, and as always with this sort of thing Jezebel also has to get in on the action. But Nestle‚Äôs plant uses only 150 acre-feet, about one forty-thousandth the amount used to grow alfalfa, and the equivalent of about a dime to our family of four.
Stop buying bottled water. Buy a real water bottle and refill it. 
Let's call a spade a spade.  The reason nestle is brought up is their other business practices.  They aren't a huge consumer of water and the people consuming the product are mostly from that region.  They have other plants in the US for different regions.  My water from them is from Texas.  I have seen others from other states.  I have yet to get one from California other than when I was in California.
What gets me isn't companies pulling water from California - it's how cheap water is for residents considering they are running out, and how much I've heard reported that each household uses, something like an average of 400-500 gallons/day, or 15k monthly.  There's five people in my house - we barely use 5k monthly, and we aren't conservative with our usage.  I even let the water run while I brush my teeth (I know, I'm a horrible person).

But seriously, with a decent amount of garden watering, plenty of showers, generous dishwashing, etc., my family couldn't come close to that average even if we tried.  What the heck are Californians doing with 400 gallons a day, watering their pet whales?
Could someone give me some context and explain to me why Nestle bottled water is at the top of my front page?
If the price for the input water was high enough, he'd move. What's so hard to see about that? If water is really in low supply... the price should be going up to send that message to the market.
Nestle is just a dirt bag company regardless of how much water they use. Plus their bottled water tastes like underwear sauce.
This is why some regulations are necessary. No corporation will do something unless it's good for business. Even Starbucks moving water bottling out of California I'm sure has some financial or at least a PR benefit to them. 
I'm not sure why people are expecting him to be the voice of reason as opposed to shamelessly forwarding Nestle Waters' agenda. 

What else did you expect him to say? Why don't you ask the CEO of Toyota what kind of car I should drive?
Just wanted to add a comment. Yes, Nestle is not even close to the main source of the problem for water in California. However that doesn't mean we should ignore practices that are also polluting and draining our earth's resources. On one hand you have the CEO of Nestle saying he wants to privatize the world's water and it isn't a human right (look it up, completely likable to an evil villain from a cartoon) and on the other hand you have people that do want to purchase and not recycle water bottles. No one is right and no one is wrong. They are a business because people buy their water. If it's going to change, people need to stop buying their water. Again, this will not help save California's water.
Aaaand I'm going to protest wisely and not buy Nestle products anymore. F that noise.
Nestle uses 0.00005% of California's water. I wonder if agricultural lobbyists could be behind "news" articles like these? At least Nestle's water is consumed by people... why is the gallons per almond being ignored? Why didn't California get additional reservoirs as its population grew by millions?
I don't really care too much about this whole ordeal. As a Californian, I know how farmers are the real issue. I especially know how there are too much livestock in CA as well. It's insane how many there are and all located in just one dang place too. What needs to happen is simply cutting back on crop and beef production in the state while oher states pick up the slack in ways they can. However, we all know profits from farmers will prevent that. The farmers here will never let go of their profits just because people are seeing water restrictions throughout the state.
Well, considering that the [actual CEO thinks that water isn't a human right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEFL8ElXHaU) this shouldn't be suprising..
How is bottling water bad for saving water?? I can see how it can be bad in the way it produces too much plastic, but in terms of saving water it must be terrific. I mean, not a single drop of water goes into a bottle that wouldn't otherwise have be drunk by a person at some point. Except when you gets the water yourself from the fountain, you have a tendency to waste it, let the water run for a little bit too long, only drinking a small part of it and so on.
Just for a sense of scale:

"Nestle‚Äôs plant uses only 150[acre feet], about one forty-thousandth the amount used to grow alfalfa[5.3 million acre feet]"

http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/
This is such deflecting bullshit. If you're concerned about water in California Nestle is not the one you need to be looking at. Big Agri thats producing millions of almonds and shipping them elsewhere? Thats where you should turn your attention. 
Drought got you down?

The first problem to tackle is *not* Nestle. The first problem to tackle is *not* agriculture either.

Problem 1: lawns. [These lawns](https://goo.gl/maps/uqOZj) in aptly named Lawndale, Los Angeles require a tremendous amount of water. People aren't drinking that water (from the tap or bottles). People aren't eating as a result of that water (lettuce or almonds or whatevs). People are looking at the result of that water. It's not an appropriate use when there are water shortages.

Problem 2: leaky pipes. From faucet drips to [broken water mains](http://www.mercurynews.com/drought/ci_26350962/california-drought-bay-area-loses-billions-gallons-leaky), California is losing 100s of billions of gallons a year to leaky pipes.

Problem 3: non-low-flow fixtures. Yes, California has good building codes, and yes it's better than it used to be, especially in commercial. But so long as Prop 13 makes residential turnover extremely slow, there's still plenty of opportunity for low flow faucets, showers, and toilets in the residential sector.

Why are these three areas the ones to go after before Nestle or agriculture? Easy. Say what you want about either, *both Nestle and farmers are producing something of positive value to Californians.* You can't say the same thing about green grass lawns, leaky pipes, or unused water going down the drain.

**TL; DR** work hard to eliminate actual waste before working hard to squeeze a use that has both pros and cons.
He doest want his stock to tank.
When I bought a water filtration system for my dunk, I was amazed my water stopped tasting like rusty sulfur farts.  
The world should introduce capitol punishment for saying shit like "it‚Äôs driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate."
At least he is honest. But he's such an easy scapegoat.
"It's driven by consumer demand."

So don't buy it if you don't like it.
As far as I know CEO¬¥s have above all a single task: Increase profit for their Shareholders.
I think we need to stop looking at symptoms and perhaps analyse the causes?

newsflash: CEO says he would make more money if he was allowed! 

Come on people. Its the share holders you want to hate on. Not the people they pay to make money for them. If he said hed prefer not to make money he'd lose his job. not that i care. you just gotta tone down the shock when a ceo says he could make more money...
By closing the bottling plant you don't stop the consumption of water.  Most of the bottled water is used to hydrate people.  If they don't buy bottled water, its not like we are going to let them die.  For this reason shutting it down will only shift people onto different water sources.

 What needs to happen is for the government to add a usage tax on water, and use the funds to improve water infrastructure for increased capacity and drought.  

This tax will make it economically hard to keep a golf course fully green in a desert.  The farmers will choose crops with less water requirements (as they will be more feasible economically).  People will have to consider if watering their lawn tonight is worth the $1.20 that it will cost them.  People may only pay a cent or two more for drinking water, as you can't actually drink thousands of gallons a day.  In a capitalist society usage is often best regulated with a price.
Farmers where I live have been talking about when California's agriculture would fail for as long as I can remember. I thought they would have figured out desalination without the brine by then. 
>"If I stop bottling water tomorrow," said Brown, "people would buy another brand of bottled water. As the second largest bottler in the state, we‚Äôre filling a role many others aren‚Äôt filling. It‚Äôs driven by consumer demand, it‚Äôs driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we‚Äôre very happy [consumers] are doing it in a healthier way.‚Äù  
  
This is the most fucking corporate statement I have ever heard.  Just look at it!  He unironically uses the phrase "on-the-go society;" he implies his company's bottled water is somehow healthier, despite the context having established that it's just tap water;  he refuses to act in the public interest because it would cut into profit margins.  Just beautiful.
Are we all forgetting the larger issues associated with the bottled water industry? Things like the high volume of packaging/plastics wastage and intensive fossil fuel use to operate facilities and transport products? The source of the water may be trivial, but the overall impact is not!
I like this discussion.  In a microcosm, its the story of what is going on the world over.  Take the money for short term gains.
Do you want a national boycott? Because that's how you get a national boycott.
Why is everyone suddenly pretending we are so dire for water that selling bottled water must be stopped? A can on soda or any other drink takes twice as much water to make as it does to just fill the bottle with water. This is such fake outrage. 
How much water are we talking about?
This is what you get for settling down in the middle of the desert. You people never played civilization? 
1) Who gives a shit. Bottled water is a drop in the ocean compared to farming. 

2) His honesty is refreshing.  
Someone should really get Tank Girl involved...
The water Nestle bottles accounts for HALF a percent of the total water in Sacramento during the period of a year. Nestle isn't the biggest problem in this picture- most people don't do their research and simply sign "change.org" petitions with no sourced facts on the issue. 
This is the elitist guy that **advocates child slavery** remember that
Wow, so many pitchforks here while they are barely using any water in compariuson to other businesses.
Honestly, I feel like it's California's fault for not taxing their water usage at a high enough rate that would cause it to be more economical to bottle water in a less drought stricken area. 
I live in California and my neighbors still water their lawns. Saw a gas station watering the grass at 2PM the other day as well. 

People don't seem to give a shit at all, even if agricultural cutbacks would be far more effective than residential ones. 
Well, you can't, because the water's not gonna be there.
Nestle uses more of California's water with the almonds in their cereals than Arrowhead could ever hope to sell.
Gov. Brown can declare the state's water a public trust/resource (whatever) and ban private sale - he could do that tomorrow 
I don't really think the problem here is with his point, but rather his quote. Just look at this headline, makes him, and therefore his company, seem greedy and selfish. 

I was in a fraternity in college, and whenever I see a high profile person cough up an awful quote like this I think the same thing; where was risk management?! 
He's a piece of shit that's what he is
To be fair, he is *a* Nestle CEO, just not *the* Nestle CEO.
People just want someone to blame. The drought exposed a lot of issues that California kept putting off. My home town did the same thing when they refused to replace the bridge that connected the East/West sides of town. What would have costed $2 million back in 1992 ended up costing $25 million in 2009 because voters/politicians kept kicking the can down the road.


So here you have California that for the past 30 years has had an explosion in population and industry growth. So instead of addressing the issue that the current water systems wouldn't sustain the of expected growth, they just kept kicking the can down the road. The problem though is that California cant just rebuild the bridge now, they have to rebuild multiple bridges while at the same time watching a few of them collapse because of the drought. So what could have cost them $1 billion 10-20 years ago is going to cost them $10 billion just for the new infrastructure while their commercial industries suffer from water shortages which then also loses them money.


But hey, what kept a politician in officer over the past 10-20 years? Proposing a tax increase for new water infrastructure or tax cuts? Cause right now bottled water is the least of the fucking problems.
This is just another example of why I sort of hate people. This has come up a million times, and every time it does, a TON of people point out that it's minuscule and that agriculture is the real problem. But that barely even slows down the bullshit
Well actually, we don't really know if it's .008% of the water supply, because no state agency is tracking how much water they're using.
Not the only reason  to dislike this guy or nestle. The list is long.

Exactly.  Nestle's water use is a ~~literal~~ drop in the bucket compared to most things in the agriculture industry.  Pressure needs to be put on them to change how they water their crops.  
No. Our enemy is *bad state government* who knowingly shuttled multiple projects that would have created extra water storage AND jobs. This could have been avoided. Screw them!

Edit: See water desalination, reclaimed water, and collecting rain run-off dumping into the Pacific 
It's mainly the dairy and meat industries. Tell people to consume less meat, cheese and milk and they'll lose their fucking minds.
Exactly! Nestly's water useage is like .0000025% of state useable source. Hell humans only account for like 12%. Were only operating on a 6,000 cubic acre overage (our anual useaage is like 85,000ish). Having nestly stoping production would be like saving .25 cubic acres. Iirc alfafa is the big culprit at something like 12% of total useage, and agriculture in general useing up like 35% in total. You think if we could manage to get agriculture to cut back 10% we would even have an issue? Probably not. 
No, no, no no no no no no no.

NO.  The agricultural sector of California does use the most water, but what all you armchair activists don't realize, is if you take away the California agriculture, expect the entire WORLD to be impacted by the loss of exported AG products.

The real issue with California is that it's sending massive amounts of water down to the southern CA/LA region to support the massive population down there.  Central and northern California regions create more than enough water on their own, if it were not sent down south, there wouldn't be a problem.

The simplest solution is instead of sending water south, bring it in from the ocean with a desalinization plant or two.  Many people don't realize that southern California is literally a desert(hell, they call it "Death Valley" for a reason). 

This problem will not be solved until there's a good solution to take care of the water needs in southern California.  As for the central valley, it's a huge valley surrounded with plenty of mountains that retain snow in the winter and bring in plenty of fresh water all spring and summer long.

Taking water from the farmers in the first place was a monumentally STUPID idea.  Now everyone who's going around trying to blame the farmers for the water issue has no idea what the central valley landscape, water supply, or water issues fall into.

Please, before you speak again, do some damn research, because frankly your opinion here is entirely unfounded. 

See for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_%28California%29#Agriculture

Also, the link in your comment does not even come close to explaining the issue at hand.  If you've never been to California, or really seen all it has to offer, then you wouldn't understand this.  It's like 4 separate states.  Not in that it's that big, but in that it's got that many different climates.  As I mentioned before you have "Death Valley" aka a giant desert with 18million people living there, you have the coastal areas, where it's always cooler, you have the central valley that some days rivals Arizona for blazing hot temperatures, and you have northern California, which feels more like Oregon than California compared to the rest of it.

That link simply shows where water is used, not where it comes from.  Look at where water is being sent around the state, and you'll see that massive amounts of water are being sent down from the north with out any consideration for the local environment.

Don't forget where all your wine, beer, fruits, vegetables, nuts, meats, eggs and other important ag products come from, it's probably California.
They consume most of the water... but i've ben thinking - they've been developing the land for a long time, and now if they stop watering it, it'll turn into dust and the wind will just take it away... not good for anybody either.
It's a shame people are falling for the low hanging fruit.  Nestle pays for the water and on top of that pays additional business TAXES to the state; money that will be needed to fix many of the problems the state of California faces.

Seriously, the packaging is more expensive than the content.
My town just put in this new thing where they clean and treat water and pump it right to your house.

It's nuts.

Edit:  Relevant [Bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEeQYzQ9dj8) episode.
I have never seen or heard of that before, I'm interested in knowing more.
Every fucking month this topic comes on here.. you pay for the convenience, not the water. 
I came here to mention something along these lines. Water is actually cheaper than those small bottles of water . 1 pint in those bottles could buy you 3 gallons at a fill up staton , plus the water isn't sitting in plastic all day . The reason this dude wants to keep bottled water is because it's part of the economy that's bringing in money by ripping people off and giving them this crappy water when we can all be saving money and drinking better quality water. And less plastic, better for the environment. I've saved so much money over time just by filling up my 3 gallon water container twice a week. I'll bring my container with me to work when we're getting low and fill it up on my way home . Freshest water I've ever had has come from those fill up stations.
They probably accidentally the whole thing.
Convenience. You know this.
Not only that, on the bottom shelf of every convenience store I've been to, i can get a gallon of purified water for about $1.25, and right above that, is a small bottle of Aquafina, for $2.  I have four Nalgenes and use the water station down the street, $1.25 for 5 gallons of purified water. 
Copying and pasting my response from another thread regarding Starbucks bottled water...

I feel like the thought process for a lot of people on here is flawed in many ways... 

First of all the fact is bottled water is highly popular and I know very few people who don't drink it. So it'll have to come from somewhere. If it's not local, the cost, environmental impact, etc will end up being much worse than locally sourcing it...

Also, is Soda okay? Energy Drinks? Fruit Juices? Beer? Many of these are bottled at the same location. And most of these beverages cause more harm than good and also due to the high sugar content, requires consumers to drink MORE water than they would have needed to if they just drank plain water.

Also who gets the right to choose? Should we force everyone to become vegetarians since beef and dairy are the primary consumers of our water? Do we stop expanding our freeways because it takes millions of gallons of water create the concrete? Do we stop the Chinese mining companies that use tons of water to mine raw minerals and send them to china and send back many of the products we use?

Also 1/3 of american's use well water, the majority of which can consume as they please and should have the right to within reason.
 
If California didn't have such a large agricultural industry, we wouldn't be in such a serious drought, so since the situation is what it is, why should Starbucks have to take the sacrifice when their water usage efficiency is close to 1:1 in comparison with beef that is like 1000:1?
Should they create regulation where to curb dairy/meat demand citizens are limited to 1lb of meat per month?


The majority of people on here are hypocritical as hell and want and spout their uninformed opinions which end up turning into some regulation that causes more harm than good. And those same people continue to eat their burgers, drink their sodas, use 50 different electronics, have more than the bare necessity of clothing,etc... Do you really need a new pair of socks because it has a hole in it or a shirt because its stained? No, none of it is absolutely necessary, but you want it...  So why does your right trump the person purchasing water at starbucks? It doesn't.

We don't have one near us.

Oddly enough, in places where tap water may not be great to drink, these machines are pretty rare.

But the Dasani truck is not.
I don't why either, man.
*Or*, you can make your own bottled water using a filter and a polycarbonate canteen like a hiker.

[The Sawyer two bag gravity filter system at REI](http://www.rei.com/product/786393/sawyer-complete-water-filter-system-2-liter), which I've owned and used for 5 yrs now without any issues...has a 1 Million Gallon filter guarantee.  

**It costs 110 dollars.  At 1M gallons, that's $0.00011 dollars per gallon, or .011 cents, or 11 thousanths of a cent per gallon.**

It comes with a tap water faucet adapter so you can filter tap water if you distrust it. 
I go to the free spring to fill my drinking water. People have claimed for of its healing properties for a couple hundred years. It is high in iron.


My tap water tastes of chlorine and smells like swimming pool water. They say they are "flushing the pipes," but that excuse only sounds reasonable the first 3 months.
> I don't why more people don't use these things.

Convenience. Everyone, eventually, will find themselves in a car, thirsty, and needing to stop and grab a bottle of water. I hate bottled water, but I still occasionally buy a bottle because I'm in a situation that it is a huge inconvenience to obtain water elsewhere. This type of purchase accounts for the vast majority of bottled water purchases. Not people making the decision that bottled water is somehow better. 
> same yield.

Less yield.


Depends where it comes from.  When I lived in California my water source was the Sierra Nevadas and the water was wonderful to drink, but up the road a few miles their source was the San Joaquin Delta and that tastes like shit.
Doesn't even fall under the same inspection standards as municipal tap water.  Basically you can take the company's word for how safe it is.
Depends where you live.
NYC tap taste like the purest waters from a virgin iceberg teleported to a warm river. I buy water for convenience. Only. 
I'm 50/50 on this, I'll buy a 24 pack of water and store it my car so I always have water. I keep a case in storage incase water is shut of for a week or so, just mainly things like that. But the people that believe bottled water is healthier for you than tap water need to slapped in the face. 
Tap water varies. Tap water where I live is absolutely horrid... I Have a filtration system, but I don't see how anyone could stomach the water in the town where I live. 
I can taste the difference..
Are we going to have to get John Oliver to do a segment on bottled water or something? 
My tap water isn't safe to drink.

So... Maybe not all people?
Nah, fuck that.
Most bottled water is just bottled tap water. 
These others as well: http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/story/d/story/company-plans-to-reopen-water-bottling-plant-in-ca/15691/K6muHCmHjU24qMbWQZrInA

and these...http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/bottled-water-california-drought
Minus the shit taste and amoebas
Except its drinking water, and it's being drunk.  All that happens is filtering and packaging.

The real issue in CA is how much the ag sector uses.  Can't really relocate thousands of crops though.


We have a lot of reclaim water areas here
Funny thing is we have one of the best water filteration plants in the world.It's better than bottled.
I live in San Diego. My tapped water tastes terrible. 
It is worse, tap water is regulated more than bottled.
I've been drinking out of the tap since I can remember. Now I have a filter. Yet people still ask why I don't get bottled water. I'm glad al of this is coming to light.
Just filter it yourself. It's super easy and fairly inexpensive to do. 

Get yourself a $100 water cooler and you've even got super hot water with no issues.

If you don't want that, pay for a bottler to deliver it, still cheaper and *far* better for you in the long run. 

Especially if you're in Southern California, this is a must. I still have nightmares from drinking it. It was like drinking hose water from satan's asshole. 
Tap water where I'm from tastes like it came from the bayou.
This sounds increasingly familiar to the plot of "The Lorax"
If you consider how honest the corporations have been in the past, and the fact that they fight *more product contents information for the consumer* by fighting *labels and labelling*, there's actually no telling what's actually in that water in the bottle. 

You're better off drinking tap, because in some cases it's wiser to trust the government than to trust corporations.  After all, a government that's not *actually run by corporations* will have no choice but to answer to the regular citizens that fund them.  For the time being, water is a public utility.

EDIT: I should have read rit100's comment first.
I've boycotted all Nestle products for personal consumption for almost 3 years now. Conscious consumerism is really not that hard.
I did some of the math on this:
http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/33z0jp/as_california_drought_worsens_critics_take_aim_at/cqpxte2

The Nestle bottling plant in Sacramento uses ~70 million gallons per year. Average central valley golf course uses 40 million gallons per year (there are at least 3 in Sacramento). It takes less than 1000 central valley residential lawns to consume 70 million gallons per year (there are at least 50,000 "average" lawns in Sacramento). 

Which is to say the golf courses and lawns of Sacramento are way more insane users of water than Nestle. Lawns around schools, cemeteries, etc. I don't recommend anyone buy bottled water. But paying to water a lawn is a whole other level of silliness.
Residential water use accounts for 5% of all water usage. Highest percentage of use is agriculture and meat production. Solutions need to start there.
sweet jeebus - how does a person use 500 gallons/day? I struggle to use 1000 gallons/month - and that's using water every day for showers/cooking/toilets. 

I don't even try to limit usage - sometimes the city calls me wondering if the water meters are working since I use <1k gallons per month. 1k gallons per person per month would be 33 gallons per day per person - what could someone possible use that much water for? 
I think it's because of how naturally dry California is.
[Turns out dude stepped down in 2008.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brabeck-Letmathe) . But still, that shows you the company culture. [Nestle is one of the Big 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/srk0k/the_illusion_of_choice/), so they dominate the global food market...
Not nearly as much as the ag business is taking, so it's not a big deal. Reddit just likes to bitch about the "evil corporations". 

I'm not saying they're in the right, I'm just saying Reddit is silly for vilifying this guy instead of the farmers.
Almost as refreshing as an ice cold bottle of Nestl√© Pure Life drinking water on a hot summer's day.
Seriously! They use less water than just two golf courses. It's ridiculous. 
California voters hate higher taxes more than we hate dry lawns. Never underestimate our irrationality when it comes to tax policy.
It's almost as if, if you artificially keep the price of a resource down, it results in overconsumption.
If you do the numbers, california has one maybe  two years worth of water from surface reservoirs. Then we have to tap underground sources, which are unregulated, and we have to somehow hook those up to our water supply. That's assuming record rains don't come, but the temperature trend isn't reassuring. I am not sure why people aren't freaking out. 
[removed]
He may very well be, but not for this. Seriously, if you ask the CEO of a company if he would rather increase or decrease his sales, obviously he will choose to increase his sales. The country wants capitalism and thats what its getting.
Yeah total piece of shit because the government sold them the minuscule amount of water (based on % of usage) at an extremely low and undervalued price. Water really needs a market value instead of some arbitrary one. 

Its hilarious how misdirected peoples rage is in regards to all this water nonsense. Reddits eating it up. 
Why not get mad at commercial car washes, golf courses, pools, or the politician that didn't adequately plan
Why, for selling a highly marketable product that California is willing to sell to him?
Nice knee jerk reaction. He's just doing his job. Don't hate the player hate the game, capitalism gonna capitalise.

Good guy Nestle water CEO upgrades facilities to recycle previously wasted water while still filling consumer demand.

Is every reddit clown an idiot hippie?
Its a fucking business and a major one at that. First of all he is selling the water he bottles at a much much higher rate then a utility company would, so whats the problem?? Not to mention the jobs lost and such from the operation stopping. Gtfo
This isn't just California.

This is how the general paradigm of our economic and political system works, and perhaps even how humanity works.  Immediate needs are given higher priority in the, well, immediate, the now.  It takes a huge amount of willpower to choose a long term benefit over an immediate gain even when the difference is considerable and demonstrably clear.

Stack that with millions of people all tripping over themselves to survive and thrive in the moment, build some complex systems like politics or bureaucracy or consumerism on top of that, and then watch stupidity in motion.
Thank you! This is also why we keep having broken water mains in LA, our water infrastructure in some areas is over 100 years old and crumbling but no one wants to take the time and money to bring it into 21st century. Its too expensive, no one wants to shut down the streets for construction and then it fails and we lose thousands of gallons of water, home, schools and businesses are flooded and streets are shut down anyways so they can slap a bandaid on the problem.
Beer does use excessive amounts of water in it's making, but I'm not sure even the most reckless of breweries has a 7:1 ratio of waste to product. Most breweries are pretty efficient with their water usage in this day and age, such as New Belgium and Smuttynose. Most of the water usage is utilized in the cooling process of the wort, but this water can be collected and reused for future batches. 
Water bottled in Cali is not shipped out of Cali.  Only spring water is shipped.  
The thing is, if the majority of the water isn't exported, does that make a difference? It will still be Californians drinking something, and they would have otherwise been drinking something else.
Wait what. New York restaurants are shipping in their tap water from California? 
Indeed. [Here's] (http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/future_tense/2014/08/WaterGallonsUsed.png.CROP.original-original.png) an easy to digest infographic illustrating the point for anyone else interested.

edit: it has also been pointed out to me by others who have done more research/are better qualified that some of the numbers in this graphic seem to be inflated. Worth reading the responses if you are skeptical.

edit 2: Thanks to /u/Grauegans who inboxed me [this](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste) article from the Guardian, which in turn references [this](http://www.imeche.org/docs/default-source/reports/Global_Food_Report.pdf?sfvrsn=0) piece from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. It states that 1 kilo of beef requires 3750 gallons of water to produce. This equates to around 1700 gallons per pound, which is pretty close to that stated in the above graphic, so as a ballpark figure it would seem this is fairly accurate.
Nestle is still an evil corporation, however.
It's not that it's wasteful of water, it's that everyone is feeling the crunch, water prices are going to rise because of this drought, and this bastard is selling water from the drought region to people at a 10,000% mark-up value. 
I'm not disagreeing with you, but perhaps private business like Nestle and all those golf courses should scale back their consumption first. I mean, the farmers are using the water to feed the nation, Nestle is just making money.
Did you mean to say scuttled, maybe? If not, I don't really follow what you are trying to say. 
I;m guessing your talking about dams/reservoirs? Wouldn't be as helpful as some (GOP) are saying they would be

http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-05/greedy-environment-keeps-stealing-california-s-water

And it seems it wasn't the state government that stopped the main project that could help, it was conflicting interests
Money spent storing what water? We haven't had any rain, and almost no snowfall to feed the water table from the mountains that would fill the new storage. 
I'm a happy meat eater but, I mean, it's pretty obvious that giving a cow, which is significantly larger than a human, enough water to last until butchering is gonna be a lot of water.
"What do you **mean** I have to make a personal sacrifice to achieve wholesale environmental change?!"
Wisconsin produces better of all three, AND has more water.

or maybe stop growing monsoon crops in a desert 
I'm not saying "take away the agriculture!". I'm saying surely improving the efficiency of the largest sector by water consumption is a prime place to begin saving water, and is **certainly** a more valid target than one company selling a relatively minute volume of bottled water.

And yes, the decision of 18 million people to live in a desert probably wasn't the best one, but if the solution was as simple as a "desalination plant or two", why on earth is it not already in widespread operation? A simple [search](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-20150426-column.html#page=1) reveals it enormously expensive, and damaging to the environment both in terms of energy costs and negative effects to local ecology.

As you have shown with your own comment, this is a complex problem and I'm aware there is not a single solution, but I still think taking a long look at the way the agricultural sector operates is an excellent place to start.

They haven't paid to renew their lease in years. They don't pay taxes to the state because their plants are on native american reservation land. They are leeches. 
They buy that water at a low rate
Genius! Someone promote this man! 
I don't know, i mean he made everyone on reddit start defending Nestle. Thats very hard to do.
> Who gives a shit. What I want to know is how the hell he thought that kind of response would be received well.

He's not the PR man.

He said the honest truth and didn't give any bullshit.

The fact that this became a reddit thread and a news story is why companies hire PR men to give vague, bullshit, feel-good answers.
He is talking to his shareholders, not to the public. The public has voted with their wallet, and they have said loud and proud they dont give a shit where the bottled water comes from. So why would he care about what they think on this issue?

His company owns 90% of the bottles on the shelf, what are you gonna do, drink tap water? Ha ha ha.
If your only argument is "he's right but he shouldn't say it because people might get upset," that pretty weak.
Well, to be fair, most municipal water supplies go overboard with additives.

In my last house, my tap water tasted like I was drinking straight out of a swimming pool because the water was so heavily chlorinated. I'm on a well now, so it's fine, but ugh.
Wow! That's awesome! I never thought I'd see a day where cold, clean water was piped right into a domicile. But as awesome as that sounds, I can't imagine why I wouldn't spend hundreds of dollars more to drive to the store every couple days and pick up another case of water bottles. What else am I gonna do with my money? Use it to enjoy myself? Spend it on my kids education? Nah.
Im drinking tap water right now AMA
[deleted]
I refill water jugs at .39 a gallon at Wal-Mart or Kroger. It's pretty common in the States. I bring in my empties, then pay to fill them.  

I have a well, and my filtration system can't handle the impurities. The area around my well is a swamp, it was dug before the area became drain off for the suburb behind me. The amount of heavy metals in the water make it unsafe to drink, so I have to buy water. It is safe to wash and cook with, but I enjoy a glass of water now and then. A filtration system that could handle it would cost me about 6 grand (US). 

Ecosystem or not, I cannot afford that. So I buy water.
Here is an example of a company that does it, they're typically by grocery stores. http://glacierwater.com
If I lived a couple miles north, I'd have some of the best water in the country. But I don't. I live where I live, and I get municipal well water, which is cloudy and smells of eggs-gone-bad.
Taste doesn't equate to quality.

Ya know this CEO seems like the guy that would have my well-being at the top of his list.
Edit: I added the hyphen.
They're both perfectly safe. We don't need fear mongering to make a point.
It's still inspected, but it's not as stringent. Different agencies (EPA vs FDA I believe)
And to think there are people who posit that privatizing municipalities is the best way to move "forward."
Exactly, where I live it's disgusting. If I lived in Vancouver BC or something I would drink it. 
In Orlando Florida tap water tastes pretty much like sulfur. 

Hmmm, sulfur. 
ya, personally I think bottled water is pretty stupid, but I happen to think that my tap water tastes better than any bottled water I've ever had.  Other people say their tap water tastes worse, so if they can get water that they think tastes better I don't blame them for buying it

Im so used to our water that i prefer it over bottled water. I think I'm just weird though.
Tastes great just across the hudson here in NJ too but my water doesn't come from upstate like yours.  
I want to slap everyone involved in making that Spotify commercial. "Tap and bottled water are the same, right?" 

"*Seriously?* Is Kale the same as Iceberg? The *right* choice is _, made by nature." RAGE.
One could accomplish the same emergency preparedness with tap water and filling jugs. What it really comes down to and nobody wants to admit it usually, is convenience.
People that think all water coming from a tap comes from a utility need a good slap.

Go drink well water in an area with high methane and rust deposits in the midwest. Or anywhere being over developed and damaging the water table.

The water will make you sick. My dog won't even drink the tap water.
I was under the impression leaving plastic water bottles in your car, and then drinking out of them, is a bad idea.
Depends on where the water comes from.
An honest answer.. I can respect that
*Filtered* tap water. Many specifically say on the bottle they used reverse osmosis. Which is better than tap in many places (taste wise). I haven't touched Houston's water unfiltered in 10+ years. Glad I have my own RO machine.
Most comes from your local bottling plant. RO'd with minerals put back in.
And all the things you mentioned are still negligible compared to farm use.
I figured as much, just trying to understand it from the residential angle.
I live in Southern California  and while I can't speak for everyone, all of my experience informs me that people here seriously don't have any survival awareness or preparedness at all, in any capacity. And not only do they not give a shit, they think anyone who gives a shit is nutty.
   
Almost no one I know has any store of water, or way of storing any significant amount water, no one has a significant store of batteries, generators, or any emergency plan. In any event where normal society is disrupted, I doubt most people would be able to last 3 days with what they have.
    
Back in 2011 there was a major power outage that lasted more than 11 hours, and left 1.4 million+ people without power. It caused a lot of issues. You'd think that that would be a wake up call to people, but after talking to people at work, school, and online, it was just like, a funny thing where people got to go home early. 

People just don't understand that there is an enormous infrastructure that lets us live where we do in comfort; to them its just a given, something that takes care of itself. If people shoot down the idea that they should have at least a couple days worth of water and nonperishable food on hand, it's no wonder that people aren't concerned about things like reservoirs.   
   
Too many people only seem to address these things after it's already too late.
there are a lot of reasons to hate Nestle.

Edit to add previous thread on why Nestle is kinda evil:  http://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2anpk3/why_are_nestle_evil/
But they're using water to grow food? Or to grow hay for cows? You know that all of that water is extremely necessary for Agriculture, right? Especially during a drought! Nestl√© is catching flak because they believe all water should be paid for, and Walmart is catching flak because they were tapping Sacramento's water supply even though their permit hadn't been renewed in over 25 years. Stop trying to blame the people that are legally doing these things. 
I mean... we can do both. They both deserve to be on a shit list.
A lot of redditors tend to be surprised that businesses want to be profitable.
Yeah and when the CEO of Nestle suggested that water needs a market value reddit also flipped its shit.
The worst is that the only reason they are pushing bottled water is because demand has increased 10% in the last year. All the major beverage companies are focused on getting market share in the water category because it is expected to have huge growth for the next few years.

The people pissed off a Nestle sure as shit don't have a leg to stand on if they consume any bottled water. If the major demand wasn't there, the industry would be smaller because the margins on water are only about 8% compared to a typical 15-20% on soda and juice.
I know this is some  conspiracy angle but I'm petrified of privatised water and the power that would exert
Most breweries are around 7:1. Sierra Nevada which has some of the most advanced brewing systems, is around 5:1 still. Also remember that most production breweries use their hot exchange water as water to clean, and thus actually being waste water.

For Sierra According to their sustainability report on their website, it's 5 barrels of water, for every barrel of beer.

The problem is, Sierra produces about 1m barrels of beer a year, which is about 31 million gallons of water. The Nestle plant made 32 million gallons worth of bottled water. Sierra ships their product all over the country, and the world, whereas the Nestle plant in CA only ships within a 200 mile radius.

If we are talking about corporations shipping water away from the state, there is way bigger offenders than Nestle could ever be. 
Using the dishwasher saves water? Is true of every brand? The lazy side of me is very excited about this.
Holy fuck, 1 Gallon of milk takes 978 gallons of water? That's something that would have never occurred to me.
Some of these make no sense to me. I wash my dishes by hand and I do not even use 5000 gal a year, so I cannot possibly save that much by switching. That is 100 gallons a week from washing dishes by hand. I do not believe it.

Actually looking at it more, most of those make no sense. 4 gallons a flush seems like a lot. 365 gallons/year for shower seems like too little. I do not think people water their lawn to the tune of almost a thousand gallons a week.
> per year, per year, per year, per year, per year, per year, per year, **per flush**.

wow, first section and I already don't trust this graphic.
Is there research to back all of these up?
Why is there no sources cited?
[deleted]
I don't trust a lot of the numbers in that graphic.

For example, I homebrew. And for 50 bottles of beer, I tend to use maybe 10 gallons of water, including washing out all my equipment. That works out to 0.2 gallons per glass of beer. That's 1% of the claimed amount in the graphic. I don't know how the bigger brewers do it, but somehow I doubt they use 100 times as much water per beer as I do. And if you include the water for used to grow the crops, you need to consider that many of those ingredients are imported and wouldn't be using local water.

California is not one of the major growers of barley, which is the grain typically used for beer. And we also don't really grow hops. Most of the hops grown in the US come from the Pacific northwest, which I admit is also getting some of our drought. But somehow I doubt the small amount of hops added to a batch of beer makes a big difference in water consumption per glass of beer.
[deleted]
Yeah, can't argue that.  Almost added that there are plenty of things to hate about Nestle.  And that this is maybe not the biggest of their problems.  
And that *ersatz* "chocolate" they sell only re-enforces the already forcible perception that they're an evil corporation. *And if the regulation [bar] was a little higher for "Milk Chocolate", then they'd probably have to get out of the business altogether.*
And watering the plants it eats.
Or you know. Don't raise them in a desert. Many states have livestock. But California for some reason thinks they need it too. And to do a stupid ad campaign about happy cows in California. 

Meh, you could say the same for just about any technological innovation you take for granted.  Stop driving, stop flying, use less electricity, living in large dwellings... 

See how receptive people will be to all of those.  
A lot of people's morality ends where their stomachs begin. (See the negative reactions to the Chick-fil-A boycotts, vegetarianism, etc.)
Says the guy posting on a computer/phone shipped from China who also probably blasts an AC all summer, among other things. 
Everyone in California that needs water should move to Wisconsin?
The meat industry _everywhere_ is wasteful. I'm no vegetarian, but you can't just ignore the ecological pyramid.
Nobody grows crops in the fucking desert. I wish people would stop with this nonsense. California *has* a desert. That doesn't mean California *is* a desert. When there isn't a massive fucking catastrophic drought going on, the central valley is some of the most fertile farmland on Earth, thanks to the confluence of coastal moisture in the air, the Sacramento River, and runoff from the tallest mountains in the contiguous United States. 

The same thing goes for the cities. People who don't know shit about our state blame LA for "being built in a desert." Las Vegas was built in a desert. Los Angeles was built on a fertile coastal flood plain with two seasonally-major rivers running through it, one of which used to flood so severely it would regularly switch its course from going South through the city to the southern coast, to going West through the city to the western coast. 
maybe.

I don't know shit about California, I'm redditing.
[deleted]
The Central Valley, which is the largest agricultural region in the state, is not a desert. Besides, this is where we draw the line on shit humans do in defiance of nature? I guess it's fine as long as everyone else in the country is willing to pay a lot more for (or not be able to buy) lots of types of produce in the winter. 
The vast majority of California's populated land mass is not desert.
California is not a desert. 
This would get you elected to office, not promoted in a company.

>vague, bullshit, feel-good answers.

Is exactly what Reddit loves the most. Facts are irrelevant but its nice when they fall in place. 
It is really weird actually. A few people seem to care about this. But most are expressing how much of a non-point it is. Either we have a bunch of lurkers that deeply care about bottled water, or we have upvote bots.
I actually love the guy for saying what he said. 
Nestle also owns a gigantic share of other food products, they are not necessarily branded Nestle, its usually a sub-brand. But we're all buying Nestle all the time and its not gonna change.

EDIT: Just FYI these are the main Nestle brands http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands . They have a lot more.
Considering where I live yes.
Shouldn't that be upsetting?
I'm curious what you mean by most going overboard.  I do chlorine treatment at a wastewater plant and we have limits that are very serious. 
You're paying like a quarter per gallon for charcoal filtered tap water.

You would save money buying a charcoal filtration system and just drinking tap water at home.
I have 3-Stage Under Counter Water Filtration System with silver filter and it is great at removing any odors or strange taste from tap water. No more buying old bottled crap. Bonus, tea has become really good.

P.S. just don't go full reverse osmosis.
That isn't fair.  You are making that shit up.

Very very few go overboard with additives.  I suggest you call your local water department and let them know something is wrong.
Are you concerned that the unknown particles in the water will give you Aspergers or cause you to become addicted to chlorine?
I'm definitely familiar with those, but didn't picture that based on /u/black_flag_4ever's description. Maybe /u/The_Truthkeeper just needed a visual.
I do this all the time. I bought 6 empty gallon jugs and just go up to my local Walmart every week and fill them up. They have a Primo station where I am. 
Jesus, know it all!
>which is cloudy and smells of eggs-gone-bad.

Is this actually safe to drink?


I don't care how healthy it is if it tastes awful - I don't want to drink it anyways.

(Now if it tastes good but is toxic, that's a different story.)
That depends on what you mean by quality. I would say that if the water is made to be drunk by humans, taste is very much a factor of it's quality.

Taste doesn't equate to toxicity, so water that tastes bad could still be safe to drink.
I'm a little buzzed right now and it took me a minute to understand that the well in well being did not refer to an underground source from whence Jack and Jill might have tried to fetch a pail of water.

Actually he has, a company as big as Nestle or McDonalds has to be 100% sure about the safety of their food, that's why you have such ridiculous standards at McDs etc.
Your water well?  Hell yeah that'd be at the top of his list.  He'd run your well dry and sell you his shitty Nestl√© water, just like he does in third world countries.
Seems like the guy that would buy a countries water and enforce killing the people that tried to collect rain water because they couldn't afford to pay 75% of their daily salary on it.
I believe the term is corporate cunt
It only has to be inspected by the FDA if the producers intend for it to cross statelines. It's up to the state if not.
I live in Vancouver BC and I can say the the water here, no matter where you are, is amazing. Anywhere you go, whether it be a washroom in a pho restaurant or the water fountain in the middle of a park full of heroin addicts, you can count on the water being as crisp and refreshing as a freshly rolled BC bud doobie.
Isn't that due to the fact it is located in the center of hell?
That's actually fish farts.

Buy a filter.
I live in Orlando, downtown, and tap water tastes fine to me as long as it's cold. My gf buys Target bottled water though because she thinks it's convenient even though I normally despise bottled water. My parents' house in Tampa Bay, their water is very "hard" though and while I'd definitely drink it, you can tell it's not as pure.
My tap water isn't undrinkable, but it's definitely not as good as the tap when I was in Socal.

These days I do a home water cooler. Cheap, pure, and nearly ice cold.

Would recommend to any regular water drinker.
Tap water in my last place tasted like pool water.
On their HBO series 'Bullshit!', Penn & Teller tested bottled water against NYC tap water in a blind taste test between several national brands and hose water. Hose waste was the hands-down victor. You're not weird: NYC water is unmatched.
You are definitely weird, but not for the water thing.
The taste of the Great Lakes were always nice. Even Ohio's well water is doable. 
Crystal Geyser's newest commercials are my least favorite commercials to come out this decade, I think. The worst one is their "Dun-dun-dun duuuuun" Beethoven spoof. The TV version of this is just...ugh, I want to punch every one in the commercial, and in the room I'm in, in the face.
Not really. The water will store safer and better in the sealed water bottles. Tap in some containers will go bad, fairly fast. 
What's wrong with admitting a desire for convenience? It's what drives most innovation. 
I'm used to danish quality tap water, so when we moved to the US, we bought a simple pitcher with a filter. Also a lot cheaper than buying tons of bottled water.
I hate how Nestl√© is such a perfect fall guy for the California agriculture industry to throw under the bus to distract people from their incomparably greater water waste. The fact that Nestl√© *does* do despicable shit makes it so hard to stand up for them and point out where the *real* problem is in this one case.

It's assholes all the way down...
Yeah especially if they are the ones who make brisk!
> To be fair, there are a lot of reasons to hate Nestle.

Yes. But this is still a classic case of scapegoating in order to avoid the real issue at hand.
There might be but this really isn't one of them
Except farmers are buying Hundreds of gallons for fractions of pennies and they are not being regulated to use less water. They use over 40% of the states water but pay less than 10% of it.

They are the problem.

Edit: Another person brought up stats, Agriculture uses over 80% of the water but pay less any other combined group.
Of course, someone from *Nestl√©* suggested it.

Have a Reddit celeb suggest it and Reddit will fall straight in line.
No, not necessarily. The studies that's based on showed a tremendous range of water usage and assumptions. The most efficient handwashing methods are much more efficient than even high efficiency dishwashers. And the most efficient hand washing subjects tend to come from water sensitive areas: California, Australia, South Africa, and, curiously, Germany. Russia was worst.

Using a dual tub or baisin sink, and not leaving water running lets you wash with 2-3 gallons vs 6 for the most efficient machines, though many use much more.

The study findings are _grossly_ misrepresented.

----

**Edit:** Since it seems to be a point of contention, yes, the _very_ most efficient machines are closer to 3 gallons than 6.  Was posting from mobile and memory and didn't have stats at hand.

Handwashing is still, _in some cases_, more efficient. Not always. Not for all households. And there are cases in which either hand or machine washing might be preferred. Again my point is that blanket claims of superiority for _either_ method don't hold water, the difference is frequently too small to matter, and that you shouldn't feel guilt-tripped one way or the other if your practices are reasonable and work for you.

The partisanship and animosity are fascinating in a sick and disturbing way. But not rational.

My comment to /r/frugal from two years ago: "[The answer is "it depends".](/r/Frugal/comments/1bz41f/is_it_cheaper_to_run_a_dishwasher_wash_by_hand_or/c9cpkh3)"

Slate article: "[Is a Dishwasher a Green Machine?](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2008/04/is_a_dishwasher_a_green_machine.html)" (2008):

>  But if you read the German study carefully, you'll see that the best hand-washers came close to matching the machine's performance. These paragons of efficiency employed a few key tricks, among them using two-basin sinks and filling one basin with hot, soapy water and the other with cold water for rinsing. They also scraped off crusty food particles, rather than wash them away with running water. Such clever hand-washers were able to keep their daily water usage below eight gallons, well within spitting distance of the machine. And their electricity usage was just 1 kWh per day.

> Those skilled hand-washers look even better when you consider the environmental costs of manufacturing, transporting, and (eventually) disposing of a machine, none of which were factored into the German study. Nor did the researchers consider the fact that dishwashing detergents often contain phosphates, which can cause ecologically harmful algal blooms in waterways. And gas-powered water heaters, which are common in the United States, are more efficient than the electrical heaters considered by the Germans.

2007 University of Bonn study, "[Washing-up Behaviour and Techniques in
Europe](http://www.landtechnik.uni-bonn.de/forschung/haushaltstechnik/publikationen/05-03-01-washing-up-behaviour)" (PDF):

>  Surprisingly for all, the _habits and practises seen vary dramatically between individuals,_ but less so between gender or between different countries of origin. Protocols of washing-up are therefore given as case reports showing the variety of habits and practises used. _Recorded consumption of energy, water and cleanser show huge differences_ as well _with almost no correlation to achieved cleaning performance._

Median range was 40-60l (10-15 gallons), and yes, _that_ is more than many dishwashers.

Note that the study involved a 12-place-setting set of dishes: 140 individual items. Or, alternatively, three full meals worth of dishes for a family of four. As other discussion in the article notes, household size is a major factor in favoring dishwasher usage.

Among the more efficient hand washers:

> _Observation:_ Altogether this test person practised an almost extremely frugal version of dish washing, however, achieved a surprisingly good dish washing result due to the multiple re-use of water.

> _Characterization:_ Female German, below 40 years of age; total water consumption: 28.7 l; energy consumption: 0.26 kWh; accumulated dish washing time: 96 min; detergent consumption: 11 g; cleaning index: 3.35 [on 5 point scale, higher is better]. 

Electric dishwashers used 15-22l of water, 1-2 kWh of electricity, 30g of cleanser, achieved 3.3-4.3 cleanliness score, and required ~15 minutes loading/unloading time, 100-150 minutes operating time.

Note that 15 l is 4 gallons, only slightly above the Eletrolux model mentioned elsewhere in this thread. 20 l is 5.3 gallons.

I've already noted that the dishwasher supplied with my apartment requires slightly over _six_ gallons per cycle, while my own hand-washing is closer to 3, a fair amount of which is unavoidable.

Pre-dishwasher rinsing should also be counted against total dishwasher usage.

It's true. It's also far "safer" but in being so you actually weaken your immune system in general.

I ironically used to wash dishes for a living so I looked it up.
I wonder if this has to do with how we tend to hand-wash dishes in homes. The thought comes from someone I knew who did a semester abroad and offered to wash the dishes, then got tackled for doing the "swish-scrub--rinse down the drain" technique. 

Proper technique was: Dishes were scraped into the trash, the sink was filled about half-way with sudsy water. Everything was cleaned and set to the side, then another half sink for rinses prior to drying. It's very similar to how my grandmother used to do dishes even with running water (and in Houston... water scarcity not an issue), and it makes sense because she came up pumping water, carrying it to the front of the house and washing in buckets in rural TX.          
Only if you wash dishes like a moron with a constantly running tap at full power. If you put ~2 gallons in the sink with a plug and do a bunch of dishes and then another gallon to rinse you will use more with an average dishwasher and about the same if you have a really efficient dishwasher.
That includes the cost of watering all the food material for the cows.  
It's ok, the water comes back. It's in some sort of a cycle or something.

Edit for all the srs answers: *whoosh*
Calculation for the water required to grow the FEED for that gallon of milk only:

A lactating cow needs 17.2 kg (dry) of feed (at 12 MJ of metabolisable energy / kg) to produce 2 kg of milk solids per day. 2 kg milk solids is roughly 22.7 L or 5.97 gallons of milk. That's about 2.9 kg of feed per gallon of milk.
Water use for ryegrass/white clover feed (common here) is about 20 kgDM/ha/mm rainfall. Therefore we need about 0.144 ha mm of rain for each gallon of milk.

That's 1440 L or 380 gallons of water per gallon milk. Still quite a ways short of 1000 gallons, but still a LOT. I don't know what they feed cows in the USA - it may require less or more water.

I just fact-checked this.  It's total BS.  It's closer to <10 gallons of water per gallon of milk.  Still a lot, but the fact that someone put their name on a thing that said that a gallon of milk requires 1000 gallons of water is fucking ridiculous and embarrassing.

[52.1 gallons of water per cow per day](http://www.hoards.com/E_crops/cf5)

even if this is an order of magnitude off because it's a bias article it's still not even close to 1000 gallons of water per gallon of milk.

edit:  it's true that i didn't count for feed, but i also didn't discount for the water that cows put back into the water system.  the cows aren't putting the water up into space, they're pissing it, shitting it, breathing it, and sweating it back into the earth. those water usage stats that i showed account for the water that farmers have to account for because it's the bulk of their water usage.  getting a cow to milking age doesn't take nearly as much water as sustaining a cow at milking age, and the water used in the cows feed isn't a useful number either.  you can go all the way up the value chain and ask how much water the engineer who created the strain of feed used per day and put that in your calculation too, but then you end up double+ counting your water usage across your hipster memes.

edit2: you guys are hilarious.  this reminds me of trying to explain why "food miles" is one of the dumbest ways to evaluate a supply chain.
I have a 1.2 gpf toilet, they are using a 1970 era toilet as their measuring stick.
I definitely think those numbers are exaggerated but at the same time, I think a lot of people over estimate how much a gallon a water actually is. It is not that much.
Healthy skepticism.

*The US Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense program provides certification that toilets meet the goal of using less than 1.6 gallons per flush.*

*Low-flush toilets use 6 liters (1.6 gallons) or less per flush as opposed to 13.2 liters (about 3.5 gallons)*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-flush_toilet

[Source of the infographic](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/08/12/ditching_bottled_water_is_a_good_idea_but_won_t_help_the_california_drought.html). They cited http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/products/toilets.html, nowhere on there does it say anything about 3.5 or 4 gallons.
It's also remarkable that a low-flow shower head saves exactly 365 gallons per year. Looks to me as if they rounded to 1 gallon per shower, and multiplied that with 365.
That's what I am curious about. I would love to see the breakdown on a pound of beef costing 1800+ gallons of water. Considering a cow can weigh like 1500lbs, that's more than  2.7 million gallons of water PER COW. That seems astronomically high to me. Where the hell did these numbers come from?
Because you don't have lobbyists, that's why.

Spend a few billion buying American politicians and you can get whatever you want done.
The same logic can be applied to many things, automotive emissions for example. Factories and power plants put out more emissions than all the cars combined yearly, and yet we need to have Super-ULEV and CAFE mandates whereas they seem to have free reign over pumping shit in to the atmosphere...
Did you count the water that was needed to grow the hops? 
That's about as simple as it gets. I guess the main stat is:

- not drinking bottled water saves ~ 30 gallons of water per person per year
- **one** apple requires ~33 gallons of water to grow

Bottled water is pretty much an irrelevance on the scale of water "wastage".
My favorite is the African baby formula one.
[Bill Burr's answer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp3nsgTQNiI)
I've noticed there seems to be a huge cognitive dissonance for a lot of people between the fact that we're turning the earth into the phone in our pockets and the fact that we're changing the planet... 

Of course we're changing the global environment! OUR SHIT IS MADE OF THE EARTH!!
None of these are environmental problems -- they're economic problems.

Cars can be electric, planes can be hydrogen fueled, electricity can be produced without emissions, and large dwellings can be land-neutral via multilevel planning.

The same goes for water. We can process massive quantities using desalination and then pipe it wherever we want, just like we do with petroleum, but that hasn't really become a topic of discussion until very recently because people have been unwilling to fund public works since the '70s.
Not really. Eating meat is dramatically worse for the environment than all those technological innovations. The problem with beef is that we need to clear the land to graze the cattle and then we need to clear more land to grow the grain that we feed them. They use up a lot of water too.
Yep, mine sure does!
 
  I only need the earth to last another 80-100 years max anyway.
Reminds me of Women's Studies majors blasting STEM for not having enough women.
Well.... it would make Wisconsin a blue state again?  :D
Stay away from the Great Lakes.
Please no.
You realize that "runoff" is transported via pipelines from the Northern half of the state? If you ever look at a "map" of how much water is transported around the state, and how, you will see there are massive amounts being sent to the South.       
        
The state is just corrupt when it comes to water usage. There's even a movie about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_%281974_film%29       
Made in 1974, set in 1937.       
      
It's not literally a desert, but it's still way too dry, even when there's not a drought, to be growing rice. 
The Southern half of the Central Valley and King's Valley generate most of the state's GDP that comes from agriculture. These area receive less than 10" of precipitation annually, which makes them deserts.

The fact that rivers run through these deserts does not make them any less of deserts. Does Cairo not sit in a desert? The Namib gets flash floods, does that mean it's not a desert? 

What about the Grand Canyon? There used to be a big river that ran through that desert but then it dried--oh no, wait, that's right California and Las Vegas diverted all the water to King's Valley farmers and SoCal swimming pools and then it couldn't reach the ocean anymore. 
The soil is like crack for plants though, that's why.
It's only terrible because of the water.  The soil and growing seasons make the state an excellent place to grow crops.  
The Central Valley is pretty fertile land as far as I know and is actually great for crops. Due to the huge population of the state there's been a ton of agricultural development outside of the valley as well, but I'm fairly certain the major concern is those in the valley. While the land might be fertile for crops, California goes through drought cycles frequently so that's the real problem. It's not like we're forcing things to grow here, it just occasionally gets really hard (like right now).

I will agree with /u/RammerJammerYlwHamr that places like Palm Springs are dumb as hell though. That's an actual desert and - as far as Mother Nature is concerned - a giant middle finger. 
People from other states aren't very rational when talking about California. It has usually been the best place by far to grow crops in the US. It has a long growing season, lots of sun, and usually a lot of water relative to other sunny places. Anywhere with the same conditions would take advantage of them. If regulations are put in place that greatly reduce CA's agricultural output, expect the same people who complain about farming in a desert to complain about how hippies and bureaucrats made their food expensive.
It's just fashionable to shit on California while benefitting from precisely what you're complaining about. Like someone in Mississippi complaining about federal taxes.
Damn, amen. Everyday there's nothing but vague bullshit on the front pages of news and politics subs.

People eat that shit up
My tap water tastes delicious. Thank you.
He means your water is not mountain spring fresh.  He doesn't want man-made additives to his h20, like chlorine and fluoride.  He wants natural additives like deer and squirrel urine.
[deleted]
Yea, I'd also like to know where this chlorine-tasting water was from. Sounds a bit exaggerated. 
If it tastes like I scooped my water up out of a swimming pool, and if the chlorine from my shower makes it smell like I just got done swimming laps, it's overboard.
You seem like someone who knows their water... What is it about reverse osmosis that makes it just taste kinda *off*? If water could expire, reverse osmosis would be it's flavor indicator.

I've tried it a few times and it tastes worse than almost all other filtered and tap waters I've tried.


Sorry I'm too busy playing minecraft and huffing chlorinated water to pay too much attention.
Yeah, it's just sulfur. You get used to it pretty quickly.
Riverside city and Riverside county in Southern California were rated among the top 10 worst in the country. Man I wish I saved the link to that article. Oddly enough, even though Riverside city resides within Riverside county, they do not use the same water sources.

UGH I didn't even know there was a whole string of them. It makes me want to fling things around at work.
Serious question... what are the signs of bad tap water?
Not in a hot car in those plastic bottles it won't. Bottled water tastes nasty when that happens.
What's stopping a person from disinfecting the jug and sealing it to prevent contamination?
Excellent philosophy, but the parent comment and thread itself was about not making needless waste rather than pure hedonism.
It's just as convenient to buy one of those reusable and portable bottles with a built-in filter. You don't have to go to the store every time for a refill. Plus you save a ton of money. That's pretty innovative if you ask me! 
Exactly. It makes so little sense to buy bottled water. In fact, the only time I do is if I'm getting fast food and don't want coffee or a soft drink.
Can we get a link/source to what you are talking about.  Its helpful to show why california agriculture is the enemy.

edit: found the source myself.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/04/03/agriculture-is-80-percent-of-water-use-in-california-why-arent-farmers-being-forced-to-cut-back/

Fuuuuuuuck brisk.
Also child slavery.
Why do we hate brisk? I like brisk
In terms of dollars, California grows more food than any other state.  Maybe some water efficiency increases could improve the situation a bit but that will probably require tax credits or some other government assistance to help pay for all the improvements.  Otherwise it will be reflected in food prices at the grocery store, which is bad for poor people and the economy in general.

Vilifying the farmers of California is to put all the blame for the problem on somebody else, when its really everybody's problem, as in the whole United States that enjoys cheap and high quality California produce.  California is not some fringe state when it comes to food production- it is a cornerstone of the US food production system.  
Farmers' water is cheaper because it's untreated, as opposed to urban water which goes through many filtering/treating processes.
And you pay less for food because of it.

I'm going to laugh my balls off when the drought gets bad enough for the California farmers to actually close up shop, causing food prices to go up and then hear about how it's all the evil 1%'s fault.
> and not leaving water running lets you wash

What sort of maniac would do wash dishes with the water running? Your sink would just overflow and water would get everywhere. Makes me shudder just thinking about it.
you obviously haven't seen my dishwasher, I'm pretty sure the wash cycle is only for ceremonial purposes
>I ironically used to wash dishes for a living

Fucking hipster kitchen workers
I'm trying really hard to understand your second sentence. "but in being so you"??? [edit: I got it now thanks guys]

Whatever. I'm going to parrot that machine dishwashing is healthy and safer for the environment and I'm not being lazy by using my dishwasher MOM.

Edited: added "for the environment". I didn't think washing them by hand was danger.
"Children who ate more fermented or farm-fresh foods also exhibited lower rates of allergies. The children with the lowest rates of allergies in the study were those whose families both hand-washed their dishes and ate a lot of food that came directly from farms."

"The UCSF researchers say that according to the hygiene hypothesis, the greatest protective effect on the immune system occurs before infants reach 6 months of age. However, this creates problems for the findings of the study, because babies this young would have very limited exposure to hand-washed dishes and utensils - especially if they were breastfed."

Your immune system is developing a ton during the first 6 months of live.  When you would not touch a utensil, plate, etc...
I don't understand this method, though. The second you rinse one soapy plate into the clean water it's no longer clean. It's soapy. You put away dishes with soap on them? You must use *some* running water.
Yeah but that is relevant to the production of milk. 
So, do you actually get more than 1 gallon of milk out of it? The pork stat seems a bit crazy too. Is that the amount of water it takes to raise the pig so yes that is what it takes to make 1 pound of pork but you're not getting just 1 pound. 

And it seems a lot of those could be combined too. Like the cheese, butter, milk, beef. 
We're already taking much more water than the surface water cycle can refresh; the issue is that we're tapping groundwater reserves that take hundreds of years to refresh. 
Did you count water used to grow their feed?
So why would you account for the water usage of any of the plants on that graphic? It's all going back to the earth just like you said. Actually that's true of every single thing on that graphic. Your reasoning for discounting feed water while accounting for any other water doesn't seem to make sense.
Looks like that only accounts for drinking and cleaning. Not any of the crops that they eat.
Hey

Just going from the NZ data that I have:

A lactating cow needs 17.2 kg (dry) of feed (at 12 MJ of metabolisable energy / kg) to produce 2 kg of milk solids per day. 2 kg milk solids is roughly 22.7 L or 5.97 gallons of milk. That's about 2.9 kg of feed per gallon of milk.

Water use for ryegrass/white clover feed (common here) is about 20 kgDM/ha/mm rainfall. Therefore we need about 0.144 ha mm of rain for each gallon of milk. 

That's 1440 L or 380 gallons of water per gallon milk. Still quite a ways short of 1000 gallons, but still a LOT. I don't know what they feed cows in the USA - it may require less or more water.

You probably know more about waste disposal for farms stateside. How does it work? Sites I've seen generally collect their faeces, urine and water from milking sheds in huge oxidation ponds rather than just letting it flow back into the land. N leeching is no joke.

Yup. I don't even know where you can find a toilet over 4 gpf.
On Wikipedia, I noticed a little tidbit at the bottom under "examples":

>The Mendelsohn House apartment complex in San Francisco replaced every 3.5 gallon traditional toilet in their 189 apartment units with 1.0 gallon high efficiency toilets equipped with¬†pressure vessels. This single apartment complex saved four million gallons of water per year.

While the infographic may be misleading, or downright wrong (I haven't looked at much else yet, just browsing through the comments here), that is a *hell* of a lot of water.

It won't solve the problem by itself, but it'd help.
Lets do some maths and see if we get in the neighbourhood of 1800 gallons per pound (around 15000 L/kg). 2.7 million seems crazy so I'm going to err on the side of too high and see where we get. This is going to be a rough calculation, so if I slip up please let me know.

Looking at NZ data here, so its probably pretty different. A beef cow looks like it drinks about 20805 L per year (2615 gallons), for a cow that probably lives for 2 and half years before slaughter. Thats assuming the peak demand of 57 L per day applies through the whole year and from day one of the cows life.

Running total: 57L * 365 * 2.5 = 52012 L of lifetime drinking water.

Cows eat grass in my country, but I'm guessing they eat some kind of separately farmed feed in the USA. However, I assume that grass takes more water to grow than maize, so I'm going to use figures for grass here.

If a cow requires roughly 1470 kg DM ryegrass feed per annum to achieve its finished weight, lives for 2.5 years and that feed grows at a rate of 18 kg DM/ha/mm with a stocking rate of about 2/ha we can do the following:

1470 kg DM * 2.5 = 3675 kg DM feed required.
3675 kg DM / 18 kg DM/ha/mm = 204.2/ha/mm
Each mm per ha is equal to 10000 L so
204.2 * 10000 L = 2,042,000 L lifetime feed water requirements.

Final total:

52000 + 2042000 = 2093000 L (553000 gallons)

553000 gallons falls a bit short. However, your estimate of the cow weighing 1500 pounds seems a bit high, the figure I found was 1150 pounds (520 kg). Also consider that much of that weight is bone, blood, connective tissue, organs, etc and is not counted towards the final "beef" weight or carcass weight. The carcass itself will be more like 570 pounds, with some of this again lost as fat and other organs, with approximitely 80% of the carcass being "meat" meat. Therefore:

569 pounds * 0.8 = 455.2 pounds of actual beef from a 1150 pound animal.

Therefore my final calculation for gallons of water per pound of beef is:

553000 gallons / 455.2 pounds beef= 1214.8 gallons per pound.

Still a bit short, but in the right order of magnitude. Considering I used a lot of NZ data, and didn't put in any water for cooling or washing down equipment etc 1800 gallons per pound is plausible.

Because cows drink water in addition to eating a shitload of plants, which also require water. The vast majority of water goes to the hay/corn which are then fed to the cattle. Of which cows eat a lot.
> Considering a cow can weigh like 1500lbs

Well I don't know how much of that actually gets used for meat, but still it does seem high.
You have to factor in the water used to grow the crops that are fed to the cow as well as all the water that a cow drinks and pees out. 
Oh yes, the scandal where they *literally* killed babies for profit.

This is sadly the view most people have. "Why the fuck should I recycle when I don't get to see the benefits of it?"
California is only blue along the coast and north. Orange county, part of San Diego, and the entire San Joaquin Valley is red. Shit the central valley, which produces most of the agriculture and dairy is really conservative. I'm assuming those would be the people who move to Wisconsin.    
  
Edit: of course most people who live here are in blue areas. We're a blue state, no shit. The question was will people moving to Wisconsin for farming make it a blue state. I'm just saying no because the Ag areas are red and those would be the people moving there.

So, [Here's an actual map of California water storage and distribution](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/California_water_system.jpg). As you can clearly see, the water that gets transported to Southern California comes from the California Aqueduct (which transports water throughout the state), the Los Angeles Aqueduct, and the Colorado River Aqueduct. 

Chinatown (which I've seen many times) is about the Owens River Valley diversion, which turned into the Los Angeles Aqueduct (which, incidentally, allowed for the explosion of the San Fernando Valley, not the main part of LA, which was already developed). If you know anything about California geography, you'll know that that water comes from the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains. That runoff is miniscule in comparison to the runoff from the western side of the Sierras. The western runoff flows freely along many small rivers and streams down into the central valley and isn't diverted except within the valley (all of which you can also see on the map). 
Wait, they grow *rice* there?

My tap water doesn't taste at all.
North Carolina tap water is delicious, Florida tap water tastes like urine.

At least in my experience.
To be fair there are some valid complaints about drinking water in some places. I lived in a rural farming college, and our tap water was so hard it came out of the pipes white. Everything that touched it got covered in calcification. A neighbor told me he couldn't ever get his hops to flower because of some mineral in the tap water. I don't know about you, but I don't want to see shit floating around in my water when I'm about to drink it. For the three years I lived there I drank filtered tap water, because broke college student, but I would have considered trading a limb for a water cooler in my house, with water from out of town.
Which suburbs?  Because if you're in Portland, chances are you're on Bull Run, which you should know is not very treated at all.  

Comparatively, if you're in Wilsonville or the further out suburbs, you're likely on well water.  
Die hard bottled water drinkers will always try to justify the ridiculous and wasteful habit of buying bottled water. There are some people on wells and whatnot that genuinely need bottled water but the majority of people are just......"eww gross, you drink tap water!?" as if they are too much of a special snowflake to drink tap themselves. It's so incredibly wasteful it disgusts me. 
I'll send you out a water test kit with a return envelope today. We'll measure the levels and let you know if there is anything out of the ordinary.
Contact your DPW.  Take samples and get them tested if the DPW ignores you.

But I bet you drink fuckin' Voss.
> What is it about reverse osmosis that makes it just taste kinda off?

It tastes off because you've never tasted *pure* water before. All the water you've had up to that point in your life has some residual amount of salt, chlorine, rust, and various contaminants affecting the taste. RO removes pretty much all of that and leaves you with just water. It's technically closer to water than even rain drops because rain drops have to form around a chunk of dust somewhere in the atmosphere
Water after reverse osmosis is almost distilled, therefore you need to reintroduse salts and minerals into it. In my experience changing mineralization cartridge even in simple filter improves taste of water. Then there's acidity of distilled water, higher PH adds to strange taste of water. Finally reverse osmosis is slow. After filtration water is collected into tank with elastic membrane and sits there for hours at room temperature.
RO removes the minerals
Water is the main ingredient in vaccinations. You do the math.

When I was going to college the water they had from the fountains was so bad that my water bobble couldnt filter out most of the taste.  No idea why the water tasted so bad since tap water from other places in the town tasted fine.  But it was all of the water at the school that tasted horrible.  
Had a Brita. Much prefer the cooler.

And I drink about 12-16 glasses a day; often enough to be choosy.

Not sure why you prefer the tap to this method.

That's actually toxic at that point and you shouldn't drink it.
What's the alternative? Buying a cold bottle of water from the store? 
Time and effort.
You can ask for tap water and they'll give it to you in a paper cup. I'm not saying there's no advantage to a bottle, but they give you a lid and everything - for free even. I know we have a law here in Arizona enforcing the free part, but I would imagine any modern day company would have that policy.
I don't have a source on me but I recall reading manufacturing trumps water use in most of the US (something like 80%). The total domicile consumption is so small it can almost be ignored. The idea of turning off the tap when you brush your teeth was just a ploy by environmentalists to get people to think about water quality and consumption.

I do it anyways; I can't stand certain inefficiencies.
If I wasn't so lazy, I would find the source that shows how much of the nation is fed by their use of that water. Nestle's importance to the nation pales in comparison.
What's the matter with Brisk?
Do they make the children drink brisk or something?
This is not true at least in all places in California. I think it's done on a county level. My father pays agricultural rates for having enough land planted, and it's the same water from the same pipe he's always had.
[deleted]
Interstingly, I rinse dishes under running water, but my total water usage is fairly low ($30/month in NE US) because of only one user. For a family, I would use a dishwasher.

However, the amount of water I use at home is much much smaller compared with the amount of water I use in my lab at work for cleaning equipment and glassware. And would not even think about reducing that amount as the cost of dirty chemical glassware would be way more due to lost experiments and time.
Look, they were washing dishes before it was cool... ok?
MA in intragovernmental sociological relations of nomadic Asian tribesmen, 4 years experience washing dishes at Chili's. Why won't anyone hire me?
The dish washer cleans better, meaning it gets rid of a lot of the germs. However, your immune system is strengthened when it encounters a reasonable level of bacteria and such, so the point /r/AdventuretimeEP is trying to make is that you don't get as much exposure from your dishes when they're washed by the dishwasher. 

The difference between the two would be so negligible that I wouldn't actually factor this in to a hand-wash vs dishwasher decision. 
I believe AdvEP is referring to 'too clean' theory.

Children who are exposed to germs develop strong immune systems.
Children who have everything sanitized do not and hence are more likely to become ill when exposed to something as adults.

Since the dishwasher can wash dishes at hotter tempertures than people are willing to touch, it sanitizes dishware better than hand washing.

'Too clean' is a theory and I am uncertain how conclusive scientists are on it.

Milk comes from different cows than beef, so they can't be combined. For cheese/milk/butter it's a matter of determining how much water is required to make (eg) a gallon of milk, then from there how much milk is required to make a pound of butter or a pound of cheese, but you *can't* combine those like: it takes 978 gallons of water to produce a gallon of milk and a pound of butter and a pound of cheese.

Anyway, those calculations all account for the amount of meat you are getting. [Here](http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-efficiency-of-meat) is an example of how that math goes about:

> Beef cattle, weighing in at around 900 pounds as an adult, require around 80 pounds of food each day, 18 pounds of which is grain (agric.gov.ab.ca), (most beef cattle in the U.S. are grain-fed (wikipedia)). Beef cattle live for only three to six years before being slaughtered (wikipedia). Calculating only a three-year lifespan, that means the cow would have consumed 18 pounds of grain per day x 365 days per year x 3 years = 19,710 pound of grain during its life. But, of course, the animal is not born full grown, so we will cut this number in half to 9,855 pounds of grain consumed in its lifetime. Typically 62% of the weight of the animal ends up as meat (dead link) [1]. So for our 900 pound example, we would have around 558 pounds of meat. 9,855 pounds of grain divided by 558 pounds of meat is 17.6 pounds of grain for each pound of meat

So that's 17.9 pounds of grain/pound of meat produced. I found [another source](http://www.gracelinks.org/1361/the-water-footprint-of-food) that suggests it takes ~140 gallons to produce a pound of corn. 140*17.9 = 2500 gallons per pound of beef.

Or, 1.3 million gallons of water for one cow, who then produces 550 pounds of beef. These numbers are probably off by about a factor of two, but I hope you see that a cow will be responsible for the consumption of a lot of water.

Edit: with more reasonable assumptions:

* 10 lbs/head/day
* 60% of 1250 becomes meat (750 pounds of beef/head)
* 7-16 months eating grain, or let's call it 12, easy number

So that means 10*365*147 = 526,000 gallons per cow, or about 700 gallons per pounds of meat, just from grain.
And the water required to sustain the cow until it's old enough to produce milk? 
[deleted]
And the water used to sustain the wife of the farmer who feeds the farmer so that he may drive the tractor to grow the feed? Cmon lol
You could shit in a river, I suppose.
So this 189-unit apartment complex saved 4m gallons of water in one year by reducing a toilet flush from 3.5 gpf to 1 gpf?

Savings per flush: 3.5 - 1 = 2.5 gallons

Total flushes = Savings / Savings per flush = 4m / 2.5 = 1.6m flushes

Flushes per apartment = 1.6m / 189 = 8465

Flushes per apt per day = 8465 / 365 = 23

23 flushes per day per apartment? I call bullshit.
> It won't solve the problem by itself, but it'd help.

It won't help in a noticeable way - all the "human" water usage is a drop in a bucked when compared to agriculture and industry.


The same goes for the energy consumption - you can switch lightbulbs all you want, you can even stop using artificial lighting in homes globally and it will be only a tiny, tiny bit of the energy consumption from various industries.
Thank you for your research and work on this.  
/r/theydidthemath  
  
Thanks for breaking it down for all the naysayers.
  


Wow! Half a million gallons of water just for the feed. 1800 gallons per pound may be bullshit, but I would have been equally shocked if I read 1200 gallons per pound in the infographic. That is absolutely nuts.
Not sure about NZ, but here in PA, USA, hay and corn are generally non-irrigated. That can't be said all over the US though.

If you look at the chart half way through it just goes to show that no one really knows how much water it takes exactly for one pound of beef, but it certainly is a lot.
Well, they did things which *caused babies to die*. Not the same as "killing babies".

Well, damn.
So then most of the population is blue...
Your water should definitely have a taste and additives or it wouldn't taste "right". Pure H2O [tastes weird and isn't good for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMh1lyeNsPc). It doesn't have a "taste" to you because you are used to drinking water that is purposely made for humans to drink.
THAT'S what water is supposed to taste like. If you have a problem with your muni water, complain to your local water authority.
But in Portland you have to go bottled if you want gluten-free water.
Used to live in Gresham in 2004, the tap water then did taste like chlorine/fluoride and it was off a Bullrun.
Most bottled is just tap run through a Pur filter anyway.
You can just get a pitcher with a charcoal filter to deal with most bad-tasting tap water. I hate the water where I live, but I just keep my Brita pitcher full and use a Nalgene bottle. It saves me so much money and I don't create nearly as much waste. 
Tapwater can taste bad. Here it tastes slightly metallic or something. Filter on faucet, bam, fixed.
I don't touch bottled water. No ethical reasons, I just refuse to pay for it. I'll drink it if someone else brought it along, but that's about it.
Ah, ok. So in order to get clean water but still get that down-home taste from my childhood, I have to run it through rusty pipes? I understand now.
I hear that due to its prevalence in the environment and high reactivity, water accounts for *70%* of an average human's mass! Disturbing!
That's the price of living on a hellmouth.
Drunk, I'm not really a foot guy by any measure but some people just have really nice feet. 
Thank you for giving me my new favorite phrase.
Most likely shitty pipes.
My experience with water fountains is that they often just produce shitty tasting water. Probably shitty/unmaintained pipes. 
It's kind of hard for Nemo with his fin and all 
Very much a source of many of the physical and mental health problems faced today I think.
I store my emergency water in the back of a nice cool porcelain tank.
you can look at it as saving yourself money, and not being wasteful. no need to think of it as saving the world, which it isn't.
That's not necessarily the point. The textile industry clothed America for example. Now it's a mostly non-domestic industry, but we're still clothed. 

For your statement to be truly relevant, we would have to be unable to increase supply of food from other areas.

It's not a question of whether or not the food should be produced, rather of where. Maybe in a mostly desert state with severe water issues isn't the best locale, regardless of soil quality.

Especially since alot of the crops in question aren't staple foods to feed the country like you imply, but of more luxury foods with a high cost of production (and a higher profit) like almonds.

I'm not taking an active stance either way, but I think perspective is important.
Brisk is the 10 cent ramen of the tea world.  It won't kill you, but if you subsist on it for a few weeks you'll wish it had.

Addendum;  Holy shit, gold while I slept for this?   Best last comment of the night yet!
Yeah. I enjoy a bottle/can of Brisk tea once in a while
They make children choose either drinking Brisk or slavery. Naturally, most pick slavery.
Yeah, those industrial washers get pretty hot!
Hey there. I'm a microbiologist. I just wanted to say that this line of reasoning is pretty faulty and I wouldn't recommend spreading it. 

YES you are right that sanitizing everything around you can have an effect on your immune system. Being regularly exposed to a healthy background level of bacteria and viruses is good. I definitely don't think people should be smearing hand sanitizers all over themselves whenever they venture outside, for instance. 

However when it comes to food-borne bacteria you should be cautious. Properly cleaning your plates and bowl and silverware won't harm your immune system, and in fact will prevent growth of bacteria that are very specificly the ones that can harm you. Staphlococcus, Campylobacter, and of course E. Coli all thrive in spoiled or old food and then can wreak havoc if they get into the digestive tract or elsewhere. 

Really, washing your dishes in a dishwasher is just fine and in fact better because it kills the bugs that specifically can makes you sick. By applying the logic of "oh I MUST expose myself to these bacteria because it's good for me" you're using the exact same misguided logic as the people that say "oh I MUST sterilize every square inch of my home and sanitize my skin because bacteria are bad for me!", you're just taking it and running in the opposite direction. 

So yeah. Go to the park, roll around in the beach, and definitely don't bother using alcohol based sanitizer (just wash your hands). But also for the love of god wash your dishes throroughly and treat cuts and scrapes with things like neosporin. It's just good sense. 
I swear, living in a frat in college made me immune to just about every disease known to man. 
/u/AdventuretimeEP for the user, /r/AdventuretimeEP for the subreddit
I fed show cattle for 14 years, and nearly wall of those numbers are way overblown.

> 900 pounds as an adult

Ideal slaughter weight is 1200-1300 pounds.

> 80 pounds of food each day

We fed 8-9 head a *total* of around 100 pounds per day.  And they weren't eating everything.

> three to six years before slaughter

Most are slaughtered between 15-24 months.  And they aren't started on grain until 8-9 months.
And that water require is probably from all sources meaning the vast majority of it is from rain water not irrigation. I live in SD and have lived in ND irrigation for crops here is fairly rare. 
Even beef cattle does not spend it's whole life in feedlot :)
I don't know about you, but I came out of the womb in a suit, holding a briefcase, and late for my meeting at the firm.
Makes for a pretty good line, actually. 

>I'm not saying Nestl√© kills babies or anything... but they do knowingly cause babies to die.
Stanhope is a genius haha
I know :(
It's the same way with Illinois. 
Yea I used to use the ZeroWater filter and basically it removes all minerals and turns it into 0 TDS. Used it for one whole year. I started reading more about how it actually drains your body's nutrients away and haven't used it since. 

Not sure if 0 TDS is the same as pure H2O though, so it could be safe.
>isnt good for you

haha here we go again
If your water can taste things you should call the news. 
I don't know, tap water is supposed to have some taste from the pipes 
I can't tell if that's a Portlandia joke...or not
It also removes  the minerals your body needs from water. The companies RO their water then add minerals back. Don't just drink only RO water it's not healthy.

Those machines are straight RO, Get a filter system if your tap water sucks but don't get an RO system. 
Yeah the buildings looked like they were built in the 50s and havent had much work done to them in that regard.  
My high school had some that tasted good and some that tasted not so good.  But they also had the most delicious water I've ever had. Most likely it wasn't that good but after 2 a day football camp training the water that shot out of this pvc pipe with holes drilled in it was the best thing ever.  
I live in the Pacific Northwest. There is free water half the year outside. It's gotta be about efficiency, man, otherwise all the effort made to pump that water goes down the drain.

I do not disagree but it is despicable to allow a company to buy municipal water at cost and then allow them to mark up their price over 1000%

Edit: but ---> buy
Where does Arizona or Peace Tea stack up on the tea scale?
I've never had a problem drinking it. It tastes fine to be honest.
On the rare occasion that I drink Brisk, it's not because I want tea, it's because I want Brisk. It's its own category of drink to me.
I like brisk. A nice cold brisk is refreshing as hell on a hot summer day. 
Ooo, burn!
I eat off the floor because I want to build up my immune system to the evil bacterias.
You feel like shit for a month and then proceed to never worry about infection again. 
Even syphilis? 
I'm surprised we didn't all die of some Oregon Trail kind of diseases 
Right. However, in California, and specifically the place where we grow all our crops, it more or less doesn't rain between late spring and early fall. I will be surprised if I see much more than a light drizzle between now and September. Which means all the time in between requires irrigation.

Because I wasn't clear enough: When I said "the place where we grow all our crops" I meant that as a Californian. "We" being Californians, and "all our crops" being the crops grown in California, and "the place" being the central valley.
Yeah, it is basically why you buy distilled water to put in your iron and mineral water to drink. Distilled water seems lifeless and weird.
It's about 50% joke.  

This city recently had protests and votes and shit to _remove_ fluoride from the city's drinking water.  Because "chemicals".  
Peace = Arizona > Brisk
As a brit, this whole thread is making me sad. 
If Brisk is a -50 on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd put Arizona somewhere around a 5 and Peace Tea (especially their Caddy Shack) closer to a 6.5. Of course, if you give me the option of Tejava, I'll never choose anything else. Solid 10/10. With or without rice.
Thanks for your honest tea
Speaking of which, shout out to honest tea ‚úä
Just slamming dudebutts all day errday.
Nestle, the same corporation that caused thousands of infant deaths in third world countries when they aggresively marketed the use of their expensive baby formula to replace breastfeeding, completely glossing over the fact that untreated local water had to be used to mix the formula.  The same Nestle that provides that delicious melimine infused milk that killed babies in China.
Guess who isn't buying Nestle products anymore.
[deleted]
I've been on a nestle ban for like 3 years now. I read that long ago that nestle consistently pulls from aquifers and springs in area that are drought stricken. People are forced to not have water for parts of the day and nestle is literally in their backyard taking all the water they can SELL. I fucking hate nestle. What's worse is it's hard to try and buy a bottle of water that isn't correlated with nestle. It's true look at the label. 

It's illegal for me to collect rain water in mass and ship it to some place in drought stages, yet nestle and other conglomerates I'm sure run rampant on public water supplies. This causes we the people to have to struggle for clean water, and worse we pay a premium for it.  

Boycott Nestle, not just water the whole brand. 
 Nestle's permit to transport water across the national forest expired in 1988. It hasn't been reviewed since, and the Forest Service hasn't examined the ecological effects of drawing tens of millions of gallons each year from the springs.

Even with California deep in drought, the federal agency hasn't assessed the impacts of the bottled water business on springs and streams in two watersheds that sustain sensitive habitats in the national forest
Nestle makes me want to store large amounts of water just for survival.

Watch [BOTTLED LIFE](http://www.bottledlifefilm.com/index.php/home-en.html) on Netflix if you wish to know more about the topic. It is outrageous.
Now, I wouldn't go on record encouraging some individual to either sabotage the pipeline in multiple places, or damage the well and pump so routinely it fails to be profitable...because that'd probably be a bad thing to do.
Nestle also denies that water is a fundamental human right and believes it should all be privatized.
Isn't this more like "F- the forest service/Department of Interior?" Their regulators knew they were breaking the rules and did nothing!
As I scroll through the comments,  I see a lot of finger pointing at Nestl√©,  which is fine,  they are a perfect example of a corporation allowed to run too far,  but let's not forget who made this possible. In this case,  that would be the U.S. Forest service.  

The Forest Service is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a forest.  They exist to maximize profits from the nation's lands,  not to protect them.  They allow logging and mining practices that have long since been deemed reckless and unsustainable. They allow water rights to be sold to the highest bidder and livestock to destroy public lands. Your tax dollars actively pay for the government to build roads in our National Parks,  solely for the purpose of allowing companies access to exploit our resources. 

Corporations cannot destroy our National Parks and Forests without the direct collusion of the Forest Service.  The system is broken and needs to be changed. 
Don‚Äôt you know laws are only for poor people, not for corporations because there the best people.
The cabin owners need to quit their whining and bribe the politicians like Nestle does....

Most places they pump water our water out of our ground and don't pay a dime for it and sell it to clueless twits (anybody who buys bottled water) as pure spring water.
Seems like current environmental policies in a nutshell. 
Are the cabin owners not allowed to get a permit?

The Story of Bottled Water (2010): https://youtu.be/Se12y9hSOM0
Not sure why anyone is surprised by this. After all their ceo clearly believes that corporate interest supercedes human interest  https://youtu.be/vWkA-uAPXCE
Nestle actually holds the *least* amount of blame in this as far as I'm concerned.  You've got demand for overpriced and unnecessarily bottled water coming from the masses on one side, and probably a government entity and/or politician making money to keep things as is.  Nestle is a just product of your own choices, water isn't fabricated in a lab.   

Edit:  Seeing lots of talk of boycotting *Nestle,* want to make a real change?  Stop drinking any water that *you* didn't bottle.  
"The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that roughly 1 percent of the water used in the state goes to industrial users, with bottling plants being a small portion of that."

It's alarmist journalism, but at least its HONEST alarmist journalism!

From what I remember from environmental science classes, most of the water used (in any state) is used by agriculture irrigation.  And most of the water used in irrigation is lost due to evaporation (never really gets to the plants).  
Crazy to think how huge Nestle is, they don't have an in with reddit to get the mods to flair this with, "misleading title" or whatever.
Money talks, bullshit (read: poor folk) walks.
Nestle owns a lot of beverage brands and I'm sure their water goes into all of them. Make sure you stop buying those beverages as well. 
[here are some of the brands they own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)
So dozens of cabin owners were required to stop drawing water from the creeks, huh?  Where they gonna get their water?  Oh, yeah...Nestle.

Well, if you all would stop buying bottled water...
Nestle CEO: "Water Is Not A Human Right, Should Be Privatized."
For what it's worth, the CEO of Nestl√© Waters North America [responded to this article](http://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/03/15/another-view-nestle-waters-backs-oversight/24797493/). Not saying it's a perfect response, but the scale of their (minimal) water use compared to agricultural uses in the state is pretty eye-opening.

For some broader context, until late last year, California did not have any regulations requiring monitoring of groundwater (water stored in aquifers deep underground) - the only state in the Western U.S. lacking such laws. That meant that farmers could drill a well on their land and extract as much as they wanted without reporting the numbers to anyone. In times of drought (i.e. now), the state would scale back or even completely halt SURFACE water (water from rivers & reservoirs) allocations to these farmers, but that woud just cause the farmers to suck out more water from their own wells. Well dries up? Just dig deeper! This has lead to a [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), with farmers using water inefficiently because of the risk that if they don't use it, someone else will.

Late last year California [finally passed legislation](http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/09/17/what-to-know-about-californias-new-groundwater-law/) requiring closer monitoring of groundwater extraction. The problem? The law goes into effect over a long time period, whereas new estimates say CA only has one year of water left unless farmers/companies/industry/residences start using it more efficiently.

TL;DR: bottled water is impractical, but if the point is saving water there are MUCH bigger fish to fry. Regardless, better laws requiring monitoring and reporting of water use will ensure that ALL users - farmers, bottled water plants, etc. - use water more responsibly.
I was able to get my work to stop putting Nestle products in their vending machines.  
Sometimes, even the small victories feel good. :)
Nestle also steals water from underground aquifers in Guelph Ontario, Canada. They've been fighting them for years over it, but they're just too big of a company for them to win.

I am so sick and tired of Nestle and their shenanigans. I kid you not I saw a Nestle employee ritually slaughter an infant baby the other day. 
Not trying to sound like a doomdayer, but how come there are only 41 comments [at time of writing this] on an issue that can affect all of us. We constantly assume that fresh drinkable water is going to be readily available in the future to us all. 
Nestle is paying $525.00/year to pull all that water from the stream while it sells the the water for millions.  That is criminal unto itself. 
omg give control of these tracts of land to the state. they have the most interest in stopping any funny business when the US forest service doesn't give a shit.
the sad thing is, these are not "news" at all. i saw a heartbreaking documentary about 10 years ago about that in school :(
Nice looking pipeline in the image. Would be nice to drive a spike into it with a sledge hammer too.

Nestle is very cunty and is part of an even cuntier group of brands.
Corporations that do this should be disbanded and have their assets distributed to the masses.  Fuck corporate America.
Nestle is a piece of shit company. This doesn't surprise me at all.
I'm amazed at how lazy you fucking idiots are. Did any of you even read the article? 

Nestle isn't breaking the law. As long as they continue to pay the fees, they can continue to collect water under the terms of the permit. The bad guy here isn't Nestle, it is the government agency that has sat on their permit application for decades, allowing Nestle to continue under the original terms.

That of course would be the same agency you all would expect to actually enforce any new regulations. Good luck with that.
Hey look everybody! I'm a corporation! That means I can do whatever the fuck I want!
And the nestle boycott continues...
This wedding is horse shit..
Corporate death penalty.  Hurry up, get those appeals streamlined and put Nestle on death row where it belongs.  Also, confiscate those ill gotten gains even before the trial just like they do to people suspected of selling drugs.  Get on it, justice system.  Go go hurry go!

Boycott Nestle


Nestle [killed thousands of babies for profit](http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards) (read the two comments, they are STILL at it 40 years later), is driving villagers into poverty by [draining their water to bottle and sell back to them for massive profits](http://www.bottledlifefilm.com/index.php/the-story.html), and [use other cheaper vegetable fats](http://www.nestle.com.eg/en/aboutus/faqs) such as [palm oil](http://www.saynotopalmoil.com/palm-oil.php) instead of cocoa butter in many products (which doesn't taste as good, of course).

If that isn't enough to make you switch, Palm oil makes shit chocolate. Cocoa butter is what they take out and replace with palm oil. Their coffee business is booming, but considering what we know about their chocolate, water, and infant formula, you can easily imagine what we don't know about their coffee.. 

Or how about their Chairman arguing that we should [privatise all drinking water?](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-privatisation-of-water-nestle-denies-that-water-is-a-fundamental-human-right/5332238). Yes, that's right, the evil bastards that did all that above, want to put water into the hands of corporations- like themselves. 

I say FUCK NO. What do think?




It wasn't until I tasted "real" chocolate, that I realized just how absolutely disgusting Nestle chocolate is.
Too bad 4-5 people on reddit will boycott nestle. Guess they're going out of business now. 
Interesting article but it could really use some editing.
TIL my local newspaper has great reporters
anybody remember Solarbabies?
"Gotta make them choclates, mate. "
Wasn't Nestle also having problems with gorillas? 


If Nestle tried "drawing" it like the cabin owners instead of "extracting" it, maybe people wouldn't be so upset.
This seems on par for California. They transfered the [Kern water bank](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/05/local/la-me-kern-water-20140306) to private pomegranate and almond growers years ago with something like a promise from them to not use their other water rights. 
Desert Sun on reddit woop woop. I grew up playing in strawberry creek. This is not okay.
For the record, national forests have always been about "mixed use", be it mining, logging, recreation, hunting, or, in this case, water. Ostensibly resources are managed to make use of the resources with degrading the ecosystem. Doesnt always work out that way.


National parks on the other hand are about recreation.

They are each administered by a different federal agency. National forests are overseen by the dept. of the interior i believe. Forgot who babysits the national parks.
Fines, fines everywhere.
We need Captain Planet to clean Nestle's shit up. 
Another example of our government whoring our resources to greedy corporations.
Fuck you Nestle. Leave the water alone. 
They are draining our aquifers that we need to survive.
So Quantum of Solace actually takes place in the US?
So that's why their water tastes so good!
Department of the Interior
John Oliver should do a segment on this
Sometimes I think their original purpose was to concentrate all the evil in Switzerland into one convenient place, like a boil, where it could be monitored.

But the guardians grew complacent, and the malignancy escaped, metastatized, and now threatens the world with packaged soups and instant noodles.
The same nestle that has tried and is trying to privatize all sources of water through legal chains to enslave all of humanity to their company store. No, seriously, dramatic visual, but accurate.
That story broke in the 70s when I was in Jr High School, the one about them and third world infant deaths due to their marketing scams with infant formula. It talked about how mother's tits dried up and they had to keep feeding their baby the formula, but it was so expensive and that they had been tricked into using it, and were working as slave labor and such to feed their baby. Not to mention their other children were now hungry, all their money being soaked out of them. 

Not a god damned thing was done about their bullshit and that was decades ago. It's no wonder we are so hated around the world. These monster corporations hide behind us and our worship of them, and we give our kids to a military machine that protects them. 

I bet we'd be sickened to death if we knew what these fucking corporations have done under our flag. 
Know what's even better? I wrote this down after a freind described this story being told in his business class: "Nestle makes baby formula. 3rd world countries see American and European products as inherently better but they don't have much access to them. Nestle, wanting to help, gave these poor families some trials of formula. But these poor families wanted it to last so they diluted it with water and the babies got sick because of malnourishment! Nestle. Just trying to help and getting brought down."

Barf. 
Yeah they're scum.  If our justice system was based on actual justice and not power to the wealthy this corporate person would have gotten the death penalty long ago.
I have a plastic crate from Carnation that says "Use by other than reg. owner prohibited by law." Fuck the system!
And people fell for it?
Wow. I'm never buying a Nestle product again.
We need to get on this shit like we got on the internet about the internet to the people that need to listen to us, start sending correspondance to those asshole senators and congressmen!

edit: lower message says they're not an american company, fuck. who's more evil than the corporate monsters??
The same Nestl√©, whose chair Peter Brabeck said ["how a sense of entitlement causes irresponsible use"](http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-peter-brabeck-attitude-water-change-stewardship) and that water is not a human right
Hopefully everyone. Fuck Nestl√©; their chocolate tastes like shit anyways. 
good luck

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
 There already was a [boycott in 1977](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott) because of the milk powder scandal. Nestle is the worst. The amout of evil shit they do is insane.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands

Here is the full list of products you will not be buying.
not most people. Most people will hear this, think "bad nestle" and continue to bring that crate of purelife to their kids soccer game followed by some nice Nestle cookies and cream ice cream.
They sell so many different things and own so many different brands that its actually hard to notice if stuff is owned by them. They are evil though. I remember seeing a video in which their CEO states that he believed fresh water is not a basic human right and should have to be bought by the gallon. Fuck him and fuck their greedy habitat destroying business model.  They have stolen water from tons of places in Africa which has ruined already poor farmers depending on that water. 
Please do the same with Frito Lay and their products.  They work with Walther Brothers Farms, who moved into South Carolina and put our Edisto River at risk.  They're a shitty company who claims to be a "family owned farm" when in reality they're just a bigass mega-farm.  They've drained wells in other communities and then battled the residents in court.  But they claim they wouldn't dream of doing it here.  And they have the Farm Bureau calling anyone who opposes them a dirty hippy and writing editorials in local papers saying people are attacking farmers by trying to save their wells.  Fuck 'em.

And fuck Nestle, too.  Sorry.
no one, everyone will continue as normal.
Make sure you look up what's Nestle, because a shit load of brands are nestle or sourced from nestle. 
They are not a good company, but if you dig deeper and look at stuff besides sites run by activists, and look into the pure facts, Nestle is either not responsible for a lot of the negativity attributed to them, or there are other factors involved which lessen their culpability.

The CEO said in a speech clip that water should not be a human right, but if you listen to the whole speech, it sort of makes sense. And then if you look at other papers that he has written, it makes a lot more sense in the context that he means. He also sits on the advisory boards of several water conservation and environmental organizations (he apparently knows a crapload about water and water conservation! Way more than you and me).

Also the infant formula scandal - the activist websites all say that they did it on purpose, but Wikipedia and other less biased sources say that it was mainly unintended consequences and human nature - free formula was provided to hospitals for mothers without adequate milk, but the 3rd world hospitals overused them on all infants. Also, uneducated mothers would try to "stretch" the formula by thinning it out, and starving their babies, and using dirty water instead of boiled water.

Nestle as a company still does what every evil capitalist company does - lie, cheat, and steal where they can, bypass regulations and do anything to maximize profits, but I don't think they actively try to do "evil against humanity" things like people say.
People who live in cabins?
You're late to the game.
as a Hershey native, their products are poisonous to me
argh... count me in.
Good luck with that. Nestle is huge.

This might be helpful

Scan the barcodes and it tells you if that is owned by companies that do X thing you don't like. 
Prepare to be boycotting a lot of companies.
Or list what companies suck in general. Oh wait reddit does that to every company everyday anyways.
there's a few troubles with this concept. sure a subreddit may raise your awareness to a wrong previously perpetrated but everyone has different limits as to what is a final straw sort of situation.  use the subreddits but also keep abreast of larger corporations you work with daily (at the top level it's probably less than you expect). I've been boycotting 2 main groups for a while Koch and Nestle. together they own 10's of thousands (together possibly hundreds?) of brands and you'll nevr be able to keep them in your head.  There are apps you can use to scan a bar code (if you got a smart phone) that will indicate brands parent companies and you can even set it up to alert you to certain groups.  To seriously boycott can be tough depending on the group, but i'll offer any help for you if you need it
I've been spreading the word here in China on Nestl√© every time it is mentioned for the past few years.  I've managed to convince quite a few people.  It's an uphill battle, though, as even for the melamine scandal other companies like San Lu took the heat.
In Brazil, Nestle destroyed an entire aquifer.
I love that you are boycotting nestle! 
 
Boycott all water bottles too! They're really just a waste anyway. And in America all you have to do is carry around a reusable and get water literally anywhere, anyway.
Their water tastest like dog shit anyway. I don't know what shortcuts they are taking, but it has bothered ever since I first tried it.
I mean, really- why would the Forest Service care what happens to our forests, right? Can you imagine the righteous indignation of the politicians if they were *ever* held accountable?
Luckily for you, nestle already has large quantities of water pre-packaged and individually wrapped, available now! For the low low price of $14,000 you can buy the "never thirsty after the apocalypse" package, with enough water for a family of 4 for 80 years!
Introducing the newest Nestle product family "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs!"
They'll confiscate your own body and sell it back to you.
How I picture the [Nestle CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiabeNR_q0U)
You would end up being labeled a terrorist in this day and age. "Terrorist repeatedly destroys pump that routinely provides water to millions..." once we get sick enough to revolt in this county we're going to be labeled as terrorists you know. It's probably going to happen in our life time.
[removed]
I wonder how they think forests will pay for the water. 
Why not hate both? I got plenty to go around.
They pump *their* water in drought stricken areas where *there* are much better uses for it because *they're* bad people.
Well, corporations do write the laws, so that makes sense.
You're almost right.  But all money comes from the people who do the work.  We stop making them money and walk, we win.
from ceo response: "Our water use in the San Bernardino National Forest is the daily equivalent of one-fifth the water used to water a single golf course in Palm Springs."

from original article see figure: 76 million gallons per year from deer canyon springs- the other nestle spring in the san bernadino national forest besides strawberry creek, the spring in question, that they do have figures on.

so just that one spring alone they draw over 200,000 gallons per day.

and the ceo says that's 1/5 the amount of water used by a single golf course in a day? so a palm springs golf course talks a million gallons per day to water? no, it doesn't that's absurd. 

and again that's not including the strawberry creek spring site with undisclosed volume.

Nestle USA, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with it's principle place of business located in California; the company that is the subject of this article is American. Nestle USA is the largest subsidiary of Nestle Holdings, Inc., which is a Swiss company.
Typically it's all three. 
We're not California?  =D
Nestle is a Swiss company.

Seriously I get that companies can get away with a lot in America, but not *everything* is our fault.
for real! If you want corporations to stop being so fucking shady, make the laws so strict they aren't worth breaking.  Right now if you can make $100 million in profits and only have a fine of $25 million, what's the insentive to stop?  If you go all Ghangis Khan on the companies leadership,  salt of the earth style, they may think better of it. 
And remember their board of directors and shareholders too.
Also fuck corporate Switzerland. 
They're a Swiss company, but yeah.
So Nestle is Ulduar.
Yeah, for those who try to boycott Nestle, it's important to note that they have bought out a lot of smaller, formerly-local water companies, such as [Deer Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Park_Spring_Water). 
The same nestle that picks up and pays migrant workers to choke him in the shower. 
Nestle is not an American company.
Are you Swiss? Because Nestle is based in Switzerland...
When people tell me free market capitalism and small government/regulatory agencies is "the best", I think of situations like this.  Seriously, these people will kill children to make a dollar.  That's not hyperbole and that's not exaggeration.  I believe in capital investment for profit, but without regulation these corps (people) will rape the land and leave it barren if they can make a few dollars.  


Most people I know honestly don't care.  They shrug and go stone deaf if you try to tell them.
You're mixing topics too much. I appreciate your sentiment and don't disagree, but you've produced no decent argument or logic here. be more cohesive next time, it'll help you to convince people who may have initially disagreed with you but now agree with you based off a more cogent argument. what you've written down is a jumble of words revolving around anger, if you care this much about it then let's all work to more eloquently state one thing wrong at a time.
>It's no wonder we are so hated around the world. These monster corporations hide behind us and our worship of them, and we give our kids to a military machine that protects them.

Nailed it on the head there.

People think so poorly of all the conflict in the middle east but in reality the West is enormously corrupt and has done some extremely shitty things.
I'd always heard it as Nestle gave 3rd world women enough free formula samples so they would stop lactating.  Then they had to buy Nestle formula.
> justice system

A justice system does not exist.  What you are referring to is called a *legal* system.  Huge difference.
plastic crate operatives have been sent to your home.  do not try to flee, citizen.
It's tainted by the tears of slaves. 
> Hopefully everyone

As a Mainer, I concur.  They've actually been trying to privatize the aquifers (the big underground deposits of fresh clean water that everyone has running under their homes to tap for well water) and charge local residents for using them because they happen to cross everyone's land and the claim is that make them property of Nestle.

I'm honestly worried they're going to start drying up the place, every year has seemed a bit drier than the last while Nestle is sending all our long-term deposits of water to the rest of the world without regard to the local environment.
Remember when a Nestle crunch used to taste pretty decent?? Now its bland cardboard with fake filler.
I'm amazed...  I just now discovered that I actually don't buy any Nestle products anyway, my boycott will be a breeze.  Thanks for the link Weedity.
There's an alternative to all of those products. I don't buy any of those things. If you care enough to boycott them then you care enough to buy a different brand for all of those things, they're normally right next to them on the shelf.
To you and all the other people saying similar things in this and the other nestle thread: when you care enough to boycott a company you don't suddenly not do it because it might be a little challenging at times. The entire point is that you are going out of your way to avoid them.  And i have mentioned several times, there is an app called buycott where you can scan the bar codes off different products you buy and find out if they are made by company that either is, or is affiliated with a company of your choosing. So you can choose nestle or Koch industries or whoever else you would like to avoid
I don't use any of their products and I haven't even tried boycotting them.
Its not that hard... 
The only thing I'd be giving up is buying hot pockets every few months then remembering why I always stop buying hot pockets.
Theres only a few of those brands that I usually buy, I guess I'll just switch to HEB brands for those.  
There's not much on that list that I found to be worth purchasing. I think I can reasonably do without Ovaltine and Coffee-Mate.
I'm always sort of amazed how it's legal to have so many different companies and brands under a single company...
Deli counter,  cheese counter, produce aisle. Done.
I'm not even trying and the only thing on that list that I've had in the past few years was a box of hotpockets. Although, I do feed my dog Purina One so I might change that.
I don't consume any nestle products except for tombstone pizza, that shit is awesome. 
I don't use any of their products without even trying not to, which was interesting given how many there are and how ubiquitous. 
Surprisingly none.  
I did pretty well actually, I only use/buy Gardiner which they have a stock and own 30% of the product. But I will stop that now
Wow... I'm surprised. I actually don't eat any nestle products.
I'm surprised I haven't bought anything off that list in years.
I breathed a sigh of relief I didn't see snickers on there.  and other than the occasional tombtone pizza or juicy juice I couldn't fine anything!  Their are alternatives, Yay!
Wow, I thought it'd be harder, turns out I naturally just don't buy nestle's things.
Check... check... check... SHIT!  They make Perrier. X-(
Im really only upset about the tombstone pizza
Toblerone is safe.
I didn't think I used an nestle products. I was wrong. Goodbye, Ozarka.
Apparently I'm already boycotting Nestle.
Thanks for the link.  Turns out I occasionally purchase 3 things on the list. I wonder if my husband will be ok with dropping Digorno pizza.  I don't like it anyway. One is a cosmetic they hold stock in (easy to drop) and the only time I buy Nestl√© candy is Halloween.  This year the kids get something else, definitely. 
I dont eat anything they own :$
I don't use a single one of those products, and I make no effort to avoid nestle. It's not hard at all if you try
1977 - that's when I started boycotting Nestle. Sad to see they have not changed a bit.
Holy shit that is long, but surprisingly the only thing I actually purchase is stouffers. 
Only 2 things Ive bought recently on that list. Arrowhead water (provided at previous job) and Haggen-Dasz.
Removing all Nestl√© wont actually be that hard for me.
People really need to stop spouting this shit. It's taking the entire speech out of context of what he was addressing and it really doesn't help your argument by spouting ignorant shit.

What he was talking about is ways to address waste of clean water which is a huge problem in a lot of the world. By guaranteeing free access to water beyond what is needed ensures that a lot of it will get wasted as we see in many parts of the US (California anyone?). It's a real problem and the solution he is proposing is to ensure that the water is controlled and access beyond what is needed is controlled.

You can disagree with his proposed solution, there's a reason it was presented during a discussion. But to constantly bring it up like he's Lex Luthor trying to destroy the world is disingenuous and just hurts your argument.
I doubt this will ever happen. Potato chips are like French fries and soda in America.  We are addicted to them. We eat millions of pounds of potatoes each year. Utz and bootleg don't taste as good but I'll give it a try! I didn't know this was going on either. It's sickening the people can't get free water yet these companies that waste billions do. 
There seems to be quite a few people in here captain cynicism. Besides, just talking about it will remind everyone to keep an eye out for the nestle logo. For anyone who doesn't know their logo is a bird in a nest 
Ah well then I guess that's okay that they didn't mean to harm people. Oopsies. 
I think sitting on a conservation board isn't itself evidence of any moral uprightness. Why do you think the Republicans put climate change denier James Inhofe as head of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works?

The full speech only sounds good if you believe in the invisible hand of the market to sort things out (which, by the way, Adam Smith did not believe). Yes there is lots of waste with water and yes people do not generally use it wisely. But thinking that privatization will solve that is a dangerous idea and one proven inaccurate by historical precedent.
It's not exactly that active of a sub
It's not overwhelmingly difficult if you mostly stick to fresh foods (meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, bread, and cheese) rather than frozen pizzas, candy, and hot pockets
some are more evil than others, so at least you can choose the slightly better ones
In defense of the face of an amoral corporation he said water should have a value assigned to it so people actually addressed their consumption of said resource in a numeric value. The infrastructure to get water to people can be extensive and costly but almost nobody actually thinks about it until the water runs out *cough* California *cough*
And then the companies to say it's harassment and taking money out of their pockets. No shit, we don't want scum like you to have money. Eat shit and dry up already. 
Just a friendly tip: "in which" is superfluous here.
That actually seems like a pretty good deal... How can I take them up on this offer? 
* may contain poison
Mmm, I love the new Rowntree's Self Actualisation!
Ok if self-actualization and strong social bonds are included in the package I'm buying at *least* one off those 
The labels are already there. What we're missing is the revolution.
Nestle would probably call them entitled and lazy. 
Keep fighting the good fight!
Welcome to California, where the policies are made up and the laws don't matter.

Our state senator, the one who is responsible for the ridiculous gun laws, got busted for gun running. Yea, this state is a joke. 
In an ideal world thats exactly what would happen, but unfortunately when you have a government full of politicians that get their political donations directly from those companies the odds of them doing more than a few token regulations to appease us peons are so low you're more likely to see Rush Limbaugh shave his scrotum on live television. 
Except people actually raided Ulduar and killed the bosses there.

So no, Ulduar is still better.
does it matter what race I am or can any migrant worker get the job and is the money good??
Let's not allow the facts to impede the outrage...
Fine, maybe we can't execute it as a corporate person, but we could deport it.
Fuck the Swiss.  Humorless cunts harbor all kinds of dirty money.  FIFA extracts huge profits out of third world countries.
Who cares where the headquarters are though, when a company has offices all over the world ?
The problem is they lobby the regulators, and they have them in their pocket. They can do whatever they want.
This isn't free market capitalism. They are protected in their actions by trade agreements shoved down the throats of third world countries. In the USA, the EPA or National Forestry Service is going to tear them a new asshole for this latest transgression. 
> Most people

It doesn't take "most people" to change things.  Vocal minorities have done very well.
You're demanding eloquence from someone who's mad because a company kills babies... I just want you to see how ironic this disposition is. If a reader is going to dismiss this entire comment because it has miniscule misplaced logic within in. We're headed for a shitty time on this earth. We need people to get mad, not grammatically critique every word. Also I'd like to see more comments hating on nestle instead of the person hating on nestle. It's just sad how we're more adamant about defending logic instead of lives that were taken.
The guy's like 60 he's earnt the right to ramble
Nestle is from Switzerland. 

Edit: You know damn well that Switzerland has no army, and that the spirit of the comment was meant for USA. Don't be dense.
Holy fuck. I was checking some background on that to see if it really was as bad as it sounded, and it's even worse. They actually sent sales representatives to third-world neighbourhoods dressed as nurses, telling parents to use baby formula instead of breastfeeding. 

Then Nestle argued its critics should focus more on unsafe water supplies instead of criticizing them. Now they're buying up those water supplies. 

It's like they're TRYING to be the most evil bastards possible. 
This is roughly how my parents explained it, when they told me why I wasn't going to be getting any Nesquick as a kid. Permanent boycott on their end.
Sounds much more accurate. I wouldn't be surprised that business students are being taught that these big corporations just want to "help" those less fortunate. How else will they get people to work for them and see past the terrible things they do to make a profit. I remember business class,and it's just that. There are no morals or ethics involved there.
[deleted]
So sad and so true.  I had a mirthless little laugh over that one.
Funny part is, these are a thing. There's actually guys who's job it is to track down and get milk crates back.

And remember, access to free water isn't a right, unless you're Nestle.  Fucking hypocritical piece of shit ceo.
Is it just going to bottled water distribution?
Hah, we sent them packing from Shapleigh!
Nestle - now run by Quantum Corp.
Oh the other food companies aren't any better. They just have more interns posting in reddit. 
I try not to buy nestle in general actually. I live in an area where I can buy everything I need from a local shop or farmers stand. AS I was reading the list, I was pretty proud of myself for not really using any of them. Then I stumbled onto Hot Pockets. Fuck. Hot Pockets.
The problem is, most people don't care enough.
Every brand product has similar problems. If you care buy at your local farmers market.
Exactly. If you eat somewhat healthy there's a strong chance you aren't buying any nestle at all
[deleted]
Yeah I've just looked down that list and don't buy any of them.

I suppose it's easier not living in the US though.
Be sure to drink your Ovaltine!
Yeah unless you hop on the Internet,  it looks like millions of different companies when in reality a grocery store only holds a few different companies worth of foods. Nestle and Coke for instance are the main source of bottled water here. Some have monopolies without looking like it at face value.  Dasani doesn't say "coke water"  it just has a tiny green transparent logo on the bottles that says bottled by coke. 
When you do the switch, mix the two together for a week or so, don't just make a hard switch. Your carpets will thank you. 
You should anyways, Purina poisons dogs. There's actually a huge lawsuit going on right now about it
As someone who only gets cheese pizza, Tombstone is pretty poor in that department.

Red Baron is where it's at
I prefer Roma pizza. To each his own.
Also, San Pellegrino.  Dirty bastards.  At least Mountain Valley is fine for now.
They have, they're much much bigger!
Stouffers and sometimes Wonka candy.. Of course they'd have their hand in the candy.
I've linked to [some sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2znxbr/investigation_reveals_nestle_extracts_water_from/cpl5ym8) in a reply.

Boycott farmers that support AgGag laws and are against regulations for the health of their animals.  Good luck eating if you live in a conservative state and don't have a huge garden.
That's an interesting point.

I kind of agree with that but a water market would need to distinguish the difference between drinking water and all other water uses. If it can't do that then the supply demand curve is going to kill some folks.
Not harassment.  The beef industry wants to say it's flat out terrorism to cost them money.  Fuckers!
Ahhh, good call. That comment was the product of being awake for 10 minutes. It looks silly now, thanks for the friendly tip.
It's not.  At one gallon per person per day, it's about 116 thousand gallons... or $232 of water from a typical municipal water supply.
What he doesnt mention is that you have to start your own artificial aquafer and drink your reclaimed pee water. The actual amount they provide is contained to a single starter package of 24  of the 500 ml bottles of water.
1 package of esteem for me, please.
You must be a 1%er!
I think people need to get fed up enough before they're willing to go up against the propaganda machine of our media and the emergency laws that will be passed to use military force on the civilian revolters.
It's a multinational. Their company is broken up into geographical divisions. The Americas has their own and there's plenty of stupid American execs there making stupid decisions. Although their Swiss CEO and their former Austrian CEO are pretty terrible people, especially the Austrian (who currently chairs their Board of Directors).

Because it means that corporate strategy is not dictated from an American perspective. 
Tax offices
True, though I think it's usually with the tacit but lazy and timid support of a mostly apathetic majority.
Which can be a bad thing. Because sometimes the majority gets the short end of the stick because an elite few controls everything. 
yup, just look at the crazy SJW's or the Westboro Baptist Church!
Tea Party, for example. They're loud as fuck, and it's worked for them.
Last I heard, they were still doing this shit in southern America. Have doctors claim breast milk is bad for the baby, here is some formula instead. Oh what is that, your baby ends up smaller and less healthy? Well, that just means more business for doctors, everyone wins!

So yes, so very evil. It's why I stopped buying any Nestle products years ago.
Funny you say that because when I was doing business studies at school, that is exactly how they seemed to spin everything. When something bad happened and a company got in trouble, it was never a case of don't do these things but more of "where did they go wrong"... No moral value at all, just how could we have done this so we would have made money instead of getting in trouble, sort of attitude about business.
did anybody ever question the ethical and moral issues brought up? I'm kind of an emotionally driven guy, I would not be able to accept the information in the classroom if it's based on faulty moral and ethics. What do the instructors/professors say when questioned?
so.... you threw away perfectly good food?
We brought home formula from the hospital. It wasn't disgusting. It was a useful supplement that we used to keep our son fed. At the beginning it was about half and half breast milk / formula. We bought formula until he was about 9 months old to supplement with. After that, it was breast milk only and we even had a back supply of milk in the freezer.

Formula isn't evil. It isn't disgusting. Be intelligent and communicative with your spouse. If the mother can breast feed and just doesn't want to, that's a problem. Maybe babies should wait until that feeling can change. If a mother can't breast feed or doesn't produce enough, formula is a wonderful option, and an even better option is getting surplus milk from another mother. Towards the end, we were able to donate our surplus to other needy mothers.

Formula is disgusting. A company isn't evil because it makes formula. People who use formula aren't some how lesser than you, as you seem to imply so strongly. Nestle or whatever formula distributor we got the formula from didn't pull a fast one over on us, and trick us into not being able to produce milk for our son. We weren't loaded up by formula producers, we were given as much as we asked for by the hospital.

The responsibility falls on mothers and parents to educate themselves about breast feeding and use either formula or donated milk as they see fit.
Justice is subjective, a legal set of rules strives not to be.
That's the whole point.
That's a fuckload of subbrand products, wow.

This shit has got to stop, buying hundreds of millions of liters of water for $2.50 plus hookup/usage fees of less than five grand? Uhhh people are suffering from droughts, and they are "buying" the water at a Steal of a "price" and reselling it back to people for $2.50 per 500ml!! For FUCK sakes people! Stop buying bottled water! Get a filter and bottle it for a fiftyith of the cost, Plus, you aren't adding more Plastic to the oceans if you stop buying bottled water.

Nestl√© literally believes that drinking water is a privalledge, despite that people will die without it, the very fucking core definition of neccesity!
here's a bigger picture of 10 major corporations and what they own
http://www.convergencealimentaire.info/map.jpg

Looks like I'm good already. I don't buy any of those.
[deleted]
Of that list, I only buy a butterfinger every couple months. Now that stops too.
MFW Kitkats are made by the devil.
Wait, Nestl√© owns Ralph Lauren Polo and YvesSaintLaurent? Shit
I knew they were a huge company with tons of brands, and I'm guessing there must be more than this. I am just surprised that I don't buy any of these brands anyways. Easiest boycott ever.
I hope that they're treating the Oompa-Loompas well.
I can safely say I buy none of those products even without trying to boycott Nestl√© 
I think my sour skittles and starbursts are safe....I hope.....sweet lord baby cheez-its I hope they are! Wait.....are cheez-its owned by Nestle? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW7Op86ox9g

But seriously, its rather crazy how its harder than you think to avoid giving money to that company when they own so many products. Well hard if you like just about half the candy out there or cereal. 
I can honestly say that I don't use a singe product on that list. It wasn't on purpose, they apparently just make a lot of shit that I don't want.

I'm pretty proud of myself right now. Fighting the good fight. ^on ^accident.
Holy shit I already don't buy any of that stuff.  I'm boycotting!
The rabbit hole goes much deeper. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
Of course Beneful is on that list. Shit's been killing animals left and right. Seems appropriate nothing loved on this planet is safe.
TIL: I've been boycotting Nestle all along, and never knew.
You mean better taste
We did manage to stop the privatization of the aquifers but they're still allowed to extract water to ship elsewhere.  No idea how to stop that aspect (all those Poland Spring bottles - those are ours).
Actually his argument is even worse - with "everyone should have access to clean water" - which translates to "let's ship all the resources of the first world to the third world so we can get that beautiful third world landscape and I can make a quick buck".
They're miserable people. Their breast milk shenanigans in Africa is especially shitty. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott

TL;DR Nestle offers free breast milk products to mothers in hospitals, and promotes their products as being superior to natural breast milk. Once the mother leaves the hospital the formula is no longer free, however since they haven't been breast feeding, they often aren't able to produce any more milk and need to rely on buying formula.
What are you referring to?
From the [Poland Springs wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_Spring) it looks like they sell 5-gallon bottles too but pretty much just bottled water.

The issue is more that they have bottling plants all around the great lakes area and the forests in the area are typically very rich and surrounded in marshes leading to a fair amount of humidity and rain but with drier conditions underground more of the water from the winter snow soaks into the ground hence it gets drier above ground with less water and less rain throughout the summer so the forests are worse off for it.

I seriously hope they get around to taxing the shit out of commercial water sales because Nestle as claimed that would put them out of business.
You shop at farmers markets but also eat hot pockets? Who the fuck are you?
I went through the list looking for things I liked and was glad to find that I don't really buy any nestle products. A lot of their products are shit to anyway. 
They're shite though. I know that's the point but if you cant find some other disgusting food to fill the hot pockets void then you're not trying hard enough.

They're not even hard to make, make a batch of filling in a slow cooker, put it in ready made puff pastry, cook in oven.

May I suggest, for a similar level of guilt and similar turdcastrophe an hour after you've eaten:

* A whole block of cheese

* Cheap Mexican food

* A whole block of butter

* An extra large pizza

* A big meat pie

* So many sweets that you think you might be sick

* A whole bag of crisps that is designed to be shared

* Sausage rolls (apparently Americans call them pigs in sleeping bags? What the fuck), pork pies etc

* Calzone

* a massive sandwich

Or just get a different brand of microwavable turnover!
Get some Pillsbury croissants, put some pizza sauce, cheese, 'ronis, or whatever you want on them, roll em up and throw em in the oven for 12 minutes. Brush some melted garlic butter on top, stuff them with your farm fresh veggies, or just cheese and meat.  Infinitely better than any microwave crap you can buy. 
Do your part first, then worry about other people later. Every penny not going to Nestle is a win for us. 
> most people

It doesn't take "most people" to change things.  Vocal minorities have done very well.
Yeah but most people are fucking retards who drink Budweiser and listen to drake. Be the change you want to see. 
I just drink vodka and eat bread.
Still leaves us Hershey and Mars candy and Michelena's and TGIFriday's frozen dinners. Thank God.
Hell, I eat an awful lot of candy and overpriced processed assembly line food, and I still apparently don't eat any Nestle products. Looking down that list, they're all pretty crappy even by junk food standards.
How hard is it to not eat candy? I don't know the last time I had bought candy from a gas station or whatever 
Thanks for the advice. I've switched before though, so I know the drill.
My SO swears by the one with the rising crust, is it Digiorno?

I don't do frozen pizza, but I have to admit the Digiorno is nice... aaaaaaand it's on the list.  Looks like I'll be forgetting to buy the favorite pizza, or negotiating for something else.  Red Baron it is!
Roma pizza is the bomb and its small so you don't feel as guilty for eating the whole thing 
> There's an advocate to boycott just about anything.

I think Spdrjay's point was that we should target the worst moral offenders.

Few companies are as bad as Nestle.
> Fad dieters would want you to boycott bread because gluten is apparently the seed of satan.

Ha, jokes on you. I want people to boycott bread because all these people joining the gluten free movement increses my choices, drives prices down, and generally makes my life better. 

So take it from someone with celiac, who has *absolutely* no vested interest in seeing more gluten free choices,  bread will totally kill you and you family and murder your children. Gluten free is the only way to save you family and their souls from eternal damnation...or something.  
How about you don't listen to others and just boycot that company that you personally find unethical. I don't mind eating animals but I can't stand companies like Coca Cola that hire mercinaries to kill unionists and so on
> Fad dieters would want you to boycott bread because gluten is apparently the seed of satan.

I've never seen someone who gave up gluten push it on other people. All I see are comments attacking those who have given up gluten, telling them there's no scientific basis for it, gluten is awesome, they should eat gluten, and them feeling better is a placebo affect and GLUTENNNNNN.

disclaimer: I eat gluten, I just get annoyed at the hatred towards people who genuinely feel better when they cut it out of their diet.
At least you'll be thin and rich!
Just go to your local farmer's market. Boom. Locally grown produce.
I'm going to choose not to listen to your downer message, and boycott unethical businesses that affect me immediately.
Immigrant's rights activists would have you boycott most vegetable producers due to poor human rights and workers' rights track records, as well, so there go the veggies.
Did you know the government puts listening devices in our cheese? Also, Gromit forgot the crackers again. 
[Tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) is my big fear here. Demarcating a separate pool for industry from our public supply is necessary for proper use. 
Hey, you can't prove that! It's illegal to take pictures of the inside of factory farms, so that means there's a 50/50 chance they treat the animals really well!
But a typical municipal water supply doesn't package them for you.
And individual governments, USA included, have assisted and enabled them.
[deleted]
exactly. better yet, write me a letter asking for permission next time.  you dolt.

his comment was "it's no wonder we are so hated around the world". referencing american hate. but it's not an american corporation. so anyway, proceed with your misattributed outrage.  it's not like there's any shortage of legitimate things to be mad at america for, and here you go picking one that doesn't even make sense.
The Americas has their own division. They have local execs that make local level decisions. They're at least partially responsible.
Honest question: what concrete actions have you taken to set yourself apart from the ["timid apathetic majority"](https://xkcd.com/610/)?
Well in America, anyway, justice is blind but has a keen ear for the clink of coins.

Check out the T. Cullen Davis trials for the best (worst?) example of this.  It will make you sick!
Or don't even buy a filter.  Most people in the states have tap water that's actually cleaner than what comes out of the bottle.
So the entire grocery store?
For some reason I'm actually surprised Coke's ventures are all drinks of some kind. 
Coca-Cola is surprisingly small compared to the others
This appears to only encompass American brands, coz I don't see Milo anywhere.    
It's a pity, I liked Milo too. 
I think they should have to display on the packaging who the mother company is. No one should have to remember all that.
That's a nice eye opener.. Crazy..
Yeah Nestle makes shit products anyways.
In the US, Kit Kat is made by Hershey.
Use a Scottish accent, and you can both be right!
I don't have much power in the world, but when I think of what those poor people in the sweat shops go through to make my chocolate and trainers, it makes me feel *good*, *powerful*, like a slave owner! If only for a moment.
TIL to not buy Poland Spring Water

Not that I waste much money buying bottled water anyhow, but still....
It's hard when they're such a big regional employer too. 
speaking of the third world and nestle, didn't they run a huge scam lying to developing countries telling them that their nestle powdered formula was better for babies than breastmilk, resulting in a ton of malnourished babies and deaths?

edit: yeah, found it     
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott

Nestle literally murdered a bunch of babies for money

here's a pic of various nestle products and brands if you want to boycott them

Shipping first world resource to third world countries *where they're extracting the same resource.*
REminds me of a story I heard in a design class...In order to introduce coffee to Japan in the early 80's (Japan was primarily a tea drinking country), Nestle first brought coffee candy into stores to get the children to eat it. Once the children began to be accustomed to the flavor of coffee, they in turn began to drink coffee...creating the business there. 
> * Sausage rolls (apparently Americans call them pigs in sleeping bags? What the fuck)

Pigs in a Blanket
I originally read your list as what I should put in a slowcooker to clone hotpocket filling. 

Got pretty confused when I got to "extra large pizza" 
> turdcastrophe an hour after you've eaten

Sums up my experience with Hot Pockets as an adult. As a young teen back in the early 90s, I could eat Hot Pockets and mini Red Baron's pizzas all day, every day. As an adult though...I need slightly chilled baby wipes to make it ok.
> Sausage rolls (apparently Americans call them pigs in sleeping bags? What the fuck), pork pies etc

It's kind of just a cute nickname and it's "pigs in a blanket" 99% of the time I hear sausage rolls.
[deleted]
Turdcastrophe has been added to my lexicon, thank you
>pigs in sleeping bags?

Holy fuck this made me laugh for a a good minute.  Thank you.
One haribo sugar free gummy bear
Went to google fu since id never heard sleeping bags ever. I dont eat that shit anyway. Turns out paula deen just put out a recipe for hogs in sleeping bags. 

Its literally 2 processed ingredients and a beaten egg. Fuck you food network.

This is why we cant have nice things.
Just drink more vodka, or switch out the bread for beer. All liquid diets are all the rage.
The only reason I still buy Hershey's once every couple months is because I had a friend who went to the Milton Hershey boarding school, and they had nothing but good things to say about it. 
I think each of them have a rising crust. I know Red Baron does plenty of other crusts (Classic, Fire baked, Pan, and a Rising Crust!).

Classic and Fire baked tend to be my favorite. When at a place like Pizza Hut I would prefer pan, and then hand tossed at dominos. It affects what the whole pie tastes like.
Fuck that shit. Mama Cozzi's from Aldi. $1.99
Digiorno? I hope that you too will be blessed with a Little Caesar's near by. A hot made pizza for the same price, or cheaper, if Kroger's not having a sale on it. I love the Italian cheese bread. 


Make your own.  Checkout /r/pizza for ideas and tips.  Here's the dough recipe I use:   http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pizza-dough-354220

Also if you like Pizza Hut pan pizzas and have a cast iron skillet, try this:

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html
Have you ever made your own pizza?  Give it a shot. I've been doing it for over a year now and I honestly couldn't eat the shit that they pass as a digiorno pizza. 
Agreed. But I think /u/wanhope's point is that it's rather subjective as to exactly who the worst moral offenders are.
> I think Spdrjay's point was that we should target the worst moral offenders


The intention is always to do something good and reasonable . . . how often does that work out? 
Oh yeah, actual celiacs or people with genuine digestive disorders are having a grand time.

One of my friends is celiac, and I'm starting to think you two subscribe to the same mantra. ;)
I just recently was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroidosis.  The molecular structure of gluten is similar enough to that of my thyroid that ingesting gluten will cause an attack.  :(

Life sucks.
[Worth a read.](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2622/did-coca-cola-torture-and-kill-workers-in-latin-america)
Didn't know about this. Is there a credible source for the information? If so, how can they do such a thing with impunity?
It's (usually) true. 

Though depending on your area the farmer's market may be seriously inflated due to wealthy yuppies hopping on green bandwagons. That and only being open for a few months of the year if you live in a place with an actual winter.
Maybe. My friend used to sell cherries roadside in norcal. You'd expect they'd be locally grown too. Nope. Imported from China.
Haha.  That's what you think.  I've seen stickers on produce in farmers markets that showed the stuff came from the other side of the country.
No one is saying you can't boycott things.

I'm just saying a subreddit that was based on boycotting would lose focus almost immediately. 
Schrodinger's slaughtehouse?
Cuddles and and ear scratches for sure.  Sigh.  I really would rather go back to being vegan than continue to support this industry.  If only keto didn't control my ravenous appetite so darn well!
The most cognitive dissonance comes from meat and dairy people. They all think their animals are so well treated except for the killing them all part. And then the whole small government thing despite them needing subsidies for feed and pretty much everything else.
Pumpkin.

Go buy buckets.
Very true. Lots of corruption going on at the state and especially the local government level. Lots of local governments have given Nestle, Coke and Pepsi billions of gallons of public water basically for free.
[deleted]
More people like the USA than we think, especially in Europe. If you just know foreigners on Reddit then you're getting a misleading view of America's image worldwide. There are also an impressive number of people that love our culture and our people, but dislike our government, which I find comforting. 
Over 20 years of research (mostly on foreign policy relating to human rights) and almost as many years speaking out and writing about same.  Some years I got apathetic and discouraged, though.  
Plumber here. Buy a filter(and not just because I want to make money from selling them). I don't drink water straight out of the tap. Aside from the health benefits of drinking filtered water (claim not evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration) you can actually save money long term. Say you're getting your bottled water by the case, at $3.99 for a case of 20 bottles. That's roughly $0.19 per bottle. You need to drink 8 bottles a day (at least that's what your doctor will say). That's $582 per year per person. For a family of 4, over 5 years, that's $11,650.80. An under sink reverse osmosis system is around $1500 installed (quality unit installed by a reputable company) and the filters and membrane need to be replaced annually at a cost of around $400. Over 5 years that's $3100, for a savings of $8550 for a family of four. 


It may be cleaner but our water where I live in Northern California taste like chlorine and fluoride. 
I was shocked at how the water tastes in the states. Even the ice in a coke gave it a disgusting taste. That was in florida in 96. Is this normal?
Shit, I have a well and a roof-fed cistern. The water gets chlorinated, charcoal filtered, UV blasted and membrane filtered before hitting the tap. It's... Just water. Real nice. 
I'm surprised that pepsico has a lot more ventures than coke.
And I 'ate the mess he left on me floor....

Ya 'eard me!
Or a slave to Nestle.
Don't buy zephyrhills either. They're doing pretty much the same thing down here in Florida
Yup. And when women found out they couldn't get the water to make the formula it was too late, because their breastmilk had dried up already from not being milked. 
I mean that is a good business model that I can see as moral.  A lot of company does this, targets the young to gain their business once they become of age.  

However, the shit they did with the breast milk in Africa is total bullshit.  It pisses me off thinking about it.  To the people that came up with this business model to lure mothers away from breast feeding to their formulas for cheap/free and cut them off when they really need it, those business assholes deserves a special spot in hell for them.
What do you call sausages with bacon on them?
I bet that would be edible. You'd need a big slow-cooker though.
> As an adult though...I need slightly chilled baby wipes to make it ok.

This fucking killed me


It is the molten cheese that burns me. Every. Single. Time. 
I didn't really intend it to be all terrible things. It started off that way and then I realised I'm not funny so I should give some real answers.

What that list is, is a list of stuff that is super satisfying but you then feel terrible for eating after, many of which may or may not cause your arse to turn inside out.
I made the switch to liquid bread diet recently.

It really does.  I prefer thin crusts, myself, so I may see what the frozen section has in that regard next time we're in the mood for a pie.
I've had Mama Cozzi's.  I LOVE their pepperoni (as in, the snack packs of meat - I'll munch on that forever), but I'm not so fond of the pizza.
I have, and I have sucked at every dough-based attempt I've made so far.  I'll tell you what I do well and is COMPLETELY awesome, though -- zucchini pizza boats.  Cut a zucchini in half, take out the seeds and then grill both sides so it's cooked through, then put on a baking sheet and cover each zucchini half with pizza sauce, cheese, and meat toppings.  

So low in carbs, and so very tasty.
Sure, but there are some things we can agree are really bad.

If you read someone a list of the awful things Nestle have done, they're going to agree that Nestle's actions were really bad. It doesn't depend on them being a vegetarian, neither is it true for every company out there.
It was huge news recently. Of course, now that I think about it none of the sources were American. 
http://colombiajournal.org/colombia73.htm
My SO and I went to a farmer's market for a class assignment and we had to ask the growers where their produce came from and like half of it was sources from the Caribbean/central America
Oh!

It looked like you were discouraging boycotts on whole by appealing to the variety of boycottable businesses out there, in hopes of leaving people feel marginalized.

As opposed to being able to affect a business' bottom line, by having people coordinate and focus on a specific target.
>There are also an impressive number of people that love our culture and our people, but dislike our government, which I find comforting. 

To be fair, we have great people and culture and a terrible government. 
[deleted]
probably more expensive than that is a brita filter. I use it all the time, and if you rent a place its a bit easier than getting management to install that 
Drinking water from reverse osmosis is generally considered bad for you unless you supplement minerals in some other way.
My hard water is perfectly safe. I tested it in my friend's lab. Sure it tastes a bit metallic, but that's fine.
The states are gigantic and water is different everywhere but generally no, the water is fine.
Bit nutty.
Zephyrhills tried to take over Three Sisters Spring in Crystal River, Florida, about 10-15 years ago. That place is pretty much [the only natural sanctuary for manatees](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/08/23/the-last-spring-protecting-floridas-manatees/) which prevents them from freezing to death in the winter. Thankfully it was saved by some very vocal activists. That's not the only time either, more recently some developers wanted to turn the land around it into condos.
As a resident of Florida, I support this message.
They're like the imaginary drug pusher you learn about in DARE.  Give free formula until you don't have any choice but to buy it.

I... I don't think I've ever had sausage with bacon on it... and now I'm pissed!

To clarify, a pig in a blanket is usually a [hot dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog) or [Lit'l Smokies](http://www.hillshirefarm.com/products/lit-l-smokies.aspx) wrapped with some sort of dough, such as a [crescent rolls](http://www.pillsbury.com/products/crescents/original). A bit of cheese on the inside is optional, but appreciated.

[These](http://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/mini-crescent-dogs/e8abc84e-8a0e-42d6-ae7e-23b677a161ac) are pigs in a blanket.
Sausages with bacon on them 
Sausage rolls
Well 5L crocks are a pretty standard size, I'm sure you'd be fine. Just cut it in four or six pieces first, or fold it over or something.
It needs liquid though. Mountain dew? 
I made the switch to liquid bread diet recently.

Lost 20 lbs and my skin has taken a healthy yellow hue.
Liquid bread? Sign me up
Try a bread machine! We actually stopped making loaves of bread with ours, and now use it mainly to mix dough for buns and pizza.
One thing you can try is getting the system down without dough.  In Poland they make these things called Zapiekanki, which is essentially an open faced pizza sub.  If you can cook one of those, all you need is to get your dough under control.  Buy premade doughs to begin with, and knead it and roll it out with a rolling pin until it's flat enough for your liking.  Then turn up crust if you want one.  Put olive oil on the pizza dough, then add your toppings.  Put it into the oven and don't take it out to serve until you've checked the middle/bottom of the pizza and can see it's cooked right to the middle.
I see. Well, it could be my fault as easily as that of my country's shit mainstream media. I know where to find good reporting, but I don't always look for it.
Thank you!
Nah, people can boycott whomever they want and organising is definitely required when combatting morally bankrupt corporations.

A subreddit would just be an awful medium to do it, especially given the shifting front page nature of these things.
A Brita filter is just an activated carbon filter. It will remove the chlorine from the water, as well as most of the turbidity(dirt) it does not remove hardness (dissolved minerals) and there is a large list of substances it will not remove. A reverse osmosis filter will remove almost everything from the water down to 1 micron. 
It's better for you than some filters because some filters remove the minerals.
Every time someone bitches about the weather being off or the wildlife lacking, I point then towards the bottled water companies and the developers. They just don't get that the condo complex that they live in and the kajillion bottles of zephyrhills water on their back porch are abominations and are wrecking our climate and ecosystem.
You've earned it. http://giant.gfycat.com/AptCelebratedAnkole.gif

Brah you gotta know, slow cookers are all about the Dr. Pepper! Do you even pulled pork! ^^^\s
I think that's probably where the cheese and butter comes in.
All we need is liquid bread, jam, peanut butter and a banana. Then we have achieved nirvana.
lalalalalalalalalala I can't hear you and I definitely don't need another appliance in my kitchen!!! lalalalalalala
yea, where i live I don't really worry about hard water. Really i just use it for taste because the water here really doesn't taste all that great.

this reminds me of a music festival I went to, and I met this hot dog vendor who was selling dollar beers. After my fourth dollar beer, I got all chatty and started asking him how he made his stuff.

The onions were slow cooked in Dr. Pepper, Sauerkraut had cola or something. I dunno, shit was the bomb. He also had hot dug buns made out of brioche. 
Then I won't mention my juicer. D'oh!
Relevant to my home province in Canada: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nestl%C3%A9-b-c-water-deal-too-cheap-says-ndp-1.2964709

They're paying $2.25 for per *million* litres. But I guess you can't call it theft if our government agrees it's a good idea. 
Quit buying bottled water people! Holy shit, why are you people doing this?
Umm. Stop buying bottled water. That should solve this problem. 
You know, I'm pretty sure there is a Video on youtube of a Nestle CEO saying that he believes water is not a natural right, but a finite resource to be controlled, and sold. It's pretty terrifying how he describes it...

**EDIT**

[Nestle CEO on Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C29_U0Ksao)

There are also a few more videos where he discusses it as well. 
From a [Sierra Club newsletter]( http://www.sanfranciscobay.sierraclub.org/yodeler/html/2010/05/article5.htm), Human water use in California is 43 MAF/year.  Of that, 34 MAF goes to agriculture, and 9 MAF goes to other uses.  The plant in question is allowed 80 million gallons per year.  Seems like a lot, until you realize that 80 million gallons is 245 acre feet.  Or 0.00272% of California non-agriculture water use.  

Should this plant be there?  No.  Will shutting it down change anything?  No.   This is a straw man.

"Nestl√© pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground ‚Äì the same rate as an average residential water user. But the company can turn the area's water around, and sell it back to Sacramento at mammoth profits," the coalition said."

So don't fucking buy it. BOOM next problem.
It's hard to imagine a more villainous, nefarious corporation.  Monsanto?  Philip Morris?  Between this and the "free formula" bullshit, Nestle makes these guys look like rank fucking amateurs.
So said Nestle plant uses roughly 300 000 m3 of water a year, and the water footprint for every person in the US is 2800 m3 a year. That means that said nestle plant have a similar water footprint than 108 americans.

This article is bullshit.
Click bait.  You can't steal something when you've been given permission to take it.  Secondly, it's not the world's water  but California's.
Stealing? They bought those politicians that are allowing it fair and square. They need to be voted out of office and ground water restrictions to be put in place. 
Pay attention to your pubic utilities guys. 
There are a lot of privatization efforts underway. Privatization means they operate to make ever increasing profit. 

My water comes from a public-non-profit utility. My bill for the last month was $15. The month before that was $13. Public utilities exist for the service of the community and quality of life. 

No matter what line they give your politicians they can not save your town on costs. There are certain costs associated with maintaining infrastructure. A lot of times politicians for the sake of getting re-elected deny these utilities for years simple increases to maintain infrastructure. 
When the amount of infrastructure decay reaches a critical level - everyone freaks out and the politicians try to unload their negligence and selfishness to a for-profit corporation. After the official hand off - it's often too late. 

Maintain your infrastructure and pay attention every now and then to requests from your public to increase rates to pay for their aging equipment. 

Now I shall plug /r/SandersForPresident  because [he understands this.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)
This is sensationalistic garbage. In 2005 California used 34 **B**illion gallons of freshwater **per day**. This is saying they took 80 **M**illion gallons **a year**

This isn't even measurable.
By my math, Nestle purchased 245 acre feet. My dad owns a relatively small orchard that requires 3.8 acre feet of water per acre, so about 500 acre feet a year, double of what nestle purchased. Its interesting to see that for all the hate that Nestle is getting, my family should, as i understand, get twice that. It easy to hate a corporation, but in this case, they aren't doing anything different than most farmers in California, big or small. Nestle is acquiring the same amount of water that a 65 acre almond orchard would need. I can think of a handful of family friends that each farm thousands of acres. I dont think Nestle should be getting as much hate as they are, direct it towards us almond farmers.  
OP has correctly quoted the headline in the linked page, but there's nothing in the content to justify the word "stealing".

It sounds like they're paying the standard going rate for tap water, and then selling it in bottles to people who are willing to pay those prices, for whatever reason.  I don't see anything here to indicate that water is being wasted; if anything, people who are paying Nestle's prices might be more careful about conserving it.

It's arguable that it's unfortunate that a water bottling plant was built in a location that is now suffering a drought, but it's not like that was a nefarious choice.

I don't see the problem here.
The target should be the so called leaders that keep selling off our water supplies. A business is going to try and make money but it's the politicians who should be held accountable. 
"stealing" when it is perfectly legal.
To everyone saying "stop buying bottled water" say that after you've moved to a small town in Texas that has tap water that tastes somewhere between a taint and a lemon. Not all tap water is created equal. 
Article title is sensationalist bullshit.

>The coalition, the crunchnestle alliance, says that City Hall has made this use of the water supply possible through a "corporate welfare giveaway," according to a press advisory.

Nestle isn't stealing anything, the state is doing the stealing and giving it to them.  Not buying bottled water is going to solve absolutely nothing.  The solution is for Californians to stop electing corrupt politicians.
The sad truth is that Nestle uses only a small percent of the water in California. They used 56 million gallons in 2013, but California uses 38 billion gallons a day. The total percentage is  0.0004% of the water consumed annually. 

Ya its a stupid idea to bottle water in a drought, but there are much bigger fish to fry in this terrible situation. 
Nestle is stealing the whole worlds water supply......right. Get a hobby or something, or maybe focus on something more worthwhile that actually has merit. Maybe the damn plastic bottles or the shitty air quality there,or the fucking traffic in that town, maybe mass transit. But not the minor amount of water that they sell for your convienece. If you stopped buying it they would stop selling it.
[deleted]
Misread this as "Nessie continues stealing world's water.." and thought the Loch Ness monster was somehow depleting our water supply
It seems like Californians are living in drought denial. Farmers are not going to scale back. Nestle isn't going budge. People are going to still water their lawns. They are going to use the same amount of water until the last fuckin drop. 
FTFA: Nestl√© pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground ‚Äì the same rate as an average residential water user.

I don't know what crack they're smoking, but here [in Los Angeles we pay $3.06 per 470 gallons ($4.863 per hundred cubic feet).](https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/wcnav_externalId/a-fr-schedul-a-res). That's almost five times what the article claims residential users pay.

EDIT - We actually pay more because your sewer charges are calculated based on your water bill, so they get you coming and going ... literally. Their system can even charge you for more sewer than the total amount of water you use. You pay $3.97 per hundred cubic feet of the calculated sewer usage, which is usually about 80% of your water bill. So in reality Los Angeles residents pay about $5.05 for 470 gallons.
Wait wait wait.. Oil companies have been pumping a liquid out of the ground for a century and selling it for profit as we run out of it and theres no outrage on here about that? At least water doesn't pollute the environment after you pump it out. 
Fuck bottled water. Buy a fucking on-tap, cheap water filter and let it run until it's just a drip. Why the fuck is anyone buying bottled water still? I'm not even a dirty hippy and I know it's wrong.
Australia - same issue different players - Coca-Cola extracts springwater for a fixed license cost of about $200/year per well. Their megaliter (million liter) rate is ~$5. 
If there was an app that used the UPC code to tell if the product was on your boycott list, would you buy/use it?
WTF? Is Nestle run by satan?  Back in the 70s they sold baby formula that was found to be non-nutrutional.  It was banned for sale in the U.S., so they sold it overseas.  So, they have a loooong history of immoral actions.

They're not alone.  Goldman Sachs has been buying crops from West African farmers, where there is a famine, because they're super-cheap.  They sell the produce in Europe where the prices are high.
If you all just stopped buying water in a fucking plastic bottle this would not even be an issue.
They aren't "stealing" anything.  They are paying the same price as everyone else.
Oh what utter fucking bullshit!

Go look up how much water Nestle uses - then compare it to a ***SMALL FARM*** nearby.  You'll notice that the farm uses WAY more water. 

And, if small farms are using more water than Nestle - and there's literally thousands of them around Nestle's bottling plant - just how much water do you think the large, industrial farms are using???
[deleted]
It's almost like a business that tries to make money. Outrageous! How dare they!
Don't buy water then?
Misleading title.

Its not stealing if the other parties are willingly involved in the process.
To me that article reads as "People who buy Nestle's bottled water are pissed that Nestle has such high profit margins on their bottled water."  Here's an idea: quit buying bottled water when you can get it from the tap for nearly free in comparison.  Nestle's revenue from bottled water tanks and you can be happy again.
Nestle owns Arrowhead Springs water now too. They are draining my spring. 
Didn't a Bond villain do this in Quantum of Solace?
Was there any followup to this, since the presser was supposed to be this last Tuesday? Any response from the media or government? I wasn't able to find anything online excepts this notifications of a press conference to be held.
they're not stealing it, they're just selling it to you
I keep trying to convince my family to buy an ontap filter, but they refuse to buy anything but bottled water simply because "It tastes better"
Thank god I have nestle stock. To the moon !
Im just curious what state they have on their mind next after they get done sucking California dry.

Fuck Nestle, never buying anything of theirs again.

Enjoy this handy chart to know what brands of theirs to avoid.

http://www.convergencealimentaire.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mapsmall.jpg
Nestle is stealing the most renewable of renewable resources from a coastal state on the planet's largest ocean? A planet comprised of at least 70% water? Those monsters!
This is why privatization or the selling of municipal water wells is a horrible idea.  
just sitting here drinking my nestle brand water... no shame.
Poland Spring is bottled by Nestle.
How is this not on the front page of /r/california ?
80 million gallons is only 245 acre feet of water.  The average suburban household uses 1 acre foot of water in a year so Nestle is using the amount of water used by 245 households in a state with almost 39 million people.  
I discovered tonight that they also make Purina dog food. So avoid that if/when you can!
They should have been put out of business back with the baby food scandal...evil mother fuckers.
there's a documentary all about this called FLOW. 
A real problem with such a shitty headline. 

First off - if they really are bottling water and then selling it to the people of Sacramento, no harm no foul. I bet they are exporting the water though and that is a problem. California does defacto export tons of water via its agricultural products but at least that is a significant value-add.

And clearly, I mean clearly, they aren't stealing the world's water. That water isn't being shipped to Mars.
Heard people talking about this at a Sacramento City Council meeting the other day, should start to pick up steam.
This is a very loosely-researched paper. I'm a Californian. Water is scarce. But, and I got in a discussion with my neighbor about this last week, water is still cheap as hell. I live in Los Angeles. *The desert*. I still regularly get mosquito bites from people watering their lawns so much it creates runoff, pools, and bugs breed in it. If water cost as much as gas, there would be fury. But, as stated, it costs 65 cents for 470 gallons. I could leave all my faucets running to create background noise to hum songs to and it wouldn't massively hurt my wallet.

I am not into corporate "welfare," but this was a deal that was struck. It wasn't that Nestle burst into government offices with machine guns and made people sign water contracts. 

If Nestle didn't have access to the water, which they had negotiated and paid for, I'm guessing they would lose a pretty substantial investment. Not only that, but California would be a state that makes deals and then breaks them when they aren't as convenient. Kind of like taking loans and then failing to repay. If you were a gazillion dollar corporation looking to make deals, you'd think twice about signing with CA if they're just going to back out later. CA will never go dry. It won't happen. Ever. The cost of water will rise until alternate sources of water become viable. Just like oil and fracking. Whenever we feel sad enough we can simply look west and notice that gigantic ocean that happens to be sitting there--it's just not cost-effective to desalinate/treat it (by a long shot).

And no, I'm not working for Nestle. All my posts are about butts and farts and PSbattles about butts and farts.
Hey I work for Nestl√© :D I'm gonna show my plant manager we made the front page of reddit. 
Get the Buycott app. It makes shopping a bit of a pain, but at least I know what I'm buying/ supporting. Every purchase is a vote!
All the water fountains here barely spout water now.
I hope we all realize this is basically the premises of Quantum of Solace, right? 
We grow crops and fruits in desert regions, using ground water. The scandalous thing is that we export them to places like northern Europe, which are water rich regions. We are basically pumping ground water from water scarce regions to water rich regions. 
Didn't know Nestle owned L'Or√©al.. anyway. 
I'll make sure to boycott them too.
Guys. Can we boycott Nestle? I think if we band together we could make a difference. Not in destroying Nestle, but reminding them that we consumers won't stand by a company that continues such inhumane practices. Come on reddit! Who's with me?

Edit: I see a lot of other comments with the same idea. Let's start an organized boycott!
I have a job application at Nestle, that job could really turn my life in a positive way... but I have a moral problem too.
They have been pulling this crap in Michigan since 2000:  
http://stopnestlewaters.org/communities/mecosta-county-mi

Also, it is so nice to hear some of you youngsters condemn the idiocy of using bottled water.
I'm in Japan and they love drinking California's water here. Crystal Geyser bottles proudly proclaim where theyre bottled. Beyonce does commercials for it. It's even cheaper than in California. You even get a free bottle holder! https://www.dropbox.com/s/heuqf1is7pgrw73/DSC_0004.jpg?dl=0
Don't blame Nestle. They're a company whose whole purpose is to make money.

Blame the governments that are selling your water to Nestle and allowing this to happen.
If Californians are stupid enough to pay two bucks for a bottle of the same water they can get out of a tap, how is this Nestle's fault?

A fool and his money were damned lucky to get together in the first place. 
Don't expect the government to do anything about it.  Elected officials receive bribes in the form of campaign donations and revolving door job offers.  The only way to do this would be to shut down Nestle's offices and plants by blocking the entrances with protesters.
A petition asking the Federal Government to ban bottling water on federal land: 

https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/block-corporations-bottling-water-federal-land-especially-drought-stricken-areas/DpQw9mJ5
I don't buy Nestle water, it comes free with my lunch
If you think logically about this (I know, not on Reddit), 80% of this water is used for human drinking water. Humans require a certain amount of water, if they didn't drink Nestle's they'd drink water from another source. The other 20% goes into the manufacturing process. 

So really, the amount of water Nestle is actually using, that wouldn't be used anyhow, is about 16 million gallons per year. That is less water than 6 acres of alfalfa will require in a year. 

Nestle Waters employs thousands of people in California. Their actual water use to job ratio is probably one of the lowest in any industry. 

This is the wrong fight in the discussion about California water use. I wonder how much support the Ag industry is giving these "protesters". 

Yes, I'm a bit cynical.
The day will come when chemists find a safe and effective way to combine hydrogen and oxygen together to create water. Hopefully.
I would like to mention that Nestle's operating margin is still only 11.9%.

I would also like to mention that they cannot control the price of water. 
They are in competition with other companies.

It's also worth mentioning that using their supply of water up completely is not in their own interest.

If water is a human right, should food not be as well?

The 3 cent tax being placed on the consumer is no different than it being placed on the producer. In the end it is one more expense that raises the cost of selling their product. If the company is still able to make a profit with the remaining margin (and they are), some amount of the tax is backward shifted onto the producer, as the price drops to remain at a competitive rate.
been boycotting Nestle ever since hearing the story of them giving free formula away in Africa only to wait till mum's tits dried up and then charge 'em money they don't freaking have in the first place
The average apartment in Sacramento uses ~200 gallons of water per day or 73,000 gallons of water per year.

Thus, Nestle's bottling plant is equivalent to the same water use as 1100 apartments.

We can do the same exercise for homes which in Sacremnto average ~500 gallons of water per day or 440 homes. 

There are 174,000 homes in Sacramento, meaning nestle is using between 0.4-0.6% of the total water being used in the area. 

Whie I do personally believe buying bottle water is not a financially smart decision, I cannot say I would be opposed to a Nestle plant in my town supporting workers, paying taxes, and creating jobs out of saps who buy bottled water.

I find it hard to believe the ENTIRE world is having a drought... 
Stealing or buying?
So if water is everyone's property, and a right. What about food? Is food the same? Also..if this water is in the aquifer, can anyone grab some if they need it? Shouldn't it belong to whomever can extract it?
Silver Lining to the Rainless Cloud: At least the climate change deniers will be too thirsty to yammer on about how there's nothing wrong. 
Just don't buy bottled water.  It is so upsetting to me seeing families buying case upon case of 12oz bottled water when our tap is so good, ludicrous.  A huge waste of money as well.  Fuck Nestle
How exactly are they stealing?  They pay the same rate as everyone else for water then bottle it and sell it.  Yes, they do that for EVIL PROFIT, however nobody is forced to buy their bottled water.  They wouldn't be doing it if there wasn't a tremendous demand for bottled water... so if there's anyone to blame wouldn't it be the consumers of bottled water?
I already buy nothing produced by Nestle. In my opinion, they rank right up there with Halliburton, Black Water and Monsanto.
If a person helped ease on a state of emergency so maliciously, they would be held accountable if they weren't lynched first.
Nestl√© then sells the people's water back to them at great profit under many dozen brand names.

Sounds like people are the ones making the voice. I can't fault nestle...

A corporation did something horrible at the expense of the planet and people and no one is doing anything but shaking a finger at them. Shocker. 
I wish nestle would just go away. 

I try my hardest to not buy their shit, but they have a near monopoly over everything you consume.
So by steal, you mean buy.  Okay.
If you don't know it yet people, corporations are evil. Yet, they only exist because state laws allow them to exist, through incorporation laws.
ITT:  We the people empower Nestle by purchasing their product.  Also, Nestle CEO has a fundamentally flawed view about privatizing H2O.
Well at least they aren't using it to produce their horrible "chocolate" candies.
The CEO of Nestl√© is the closest we have to a modern day supervillain. 
It's interesting, when it's a European company being greedy and fucking up the environment, everyone is okay with just shaming the company. When it's an American company, all the haters come out shaming the entire U.S. for one company.
Don't you know, this is ***the world's water***, Nestle?!!!
Is Nespresso in the same boat as Nestle?
The name of the organization is the "Crunch Nestle Alliance".  I am unsure if a pun was intended or not.
Governments, corporations, and the world bank makes profit from privatizing water. 
Jesse Ventura did a very informative video on this a few years back when Nestle was harvesting the great Lakes. If I had link I'd share, however the case Google it if your interested in this topic.  
What else is new?
Btw guys when they say agriculture it includes meat production. Majority of the water use is spent on animals in factory farms and dont forget the water spent on the crops to feed them. People that are saying almonds are the problem are pretty funny.
Just wait till we figure out fusion and start using up the hydrogen from water. Bet nestle has stock piles of water bottles.
360000 tonnes is less water than 1000 households use per year. @ 1000 liters per day. Hardly the cause or effect of any water shortages.
la is offering to buy water from farmers around them for 567.24/million liters.

this kind of made me think, wow i wonder why sacramento doesn't sell to la.

so i checked the size of a truck, and it turns out that tank trucks can carry something like 10,000 liters of fluid. At la's rate of 567.24/million liters that means that a tank truck with 10,000 liters would be worth $5.67 to la.

i'm not sure how nestle plans to ship this water, or where they plan to ship it to, but it may not be as lucrative as it seems to be. transportation is probably their main cost. either way i don't think cities in california should be selling water for $2.25/million gallons while local news channels are telling people that they should be getting ready to ration water usage.

if people are going to have to start rationing water usage then water that has been used in for profit ventures in the area should have been lowering their usage every year leading up to that rationing.

this is kind of something that the entire country should be angry about, california is a huge bread basket of the united states. (from wiki) "The San Joaquin Valley [in california] produces the majority of the 12.8% of the United States' agricultural production", "According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture‚Äôs ranking of market value of agricultural products sold, nine of the nation‚Äôs top 10, and 12 of the top 20, producing counties are in California."

if farms in California aren't getting enough water food prices are probably going up for everyone else also
Read that as Nessie and got really excited
Where's Tank Girl when you need her...
let's just all buy Nestle stock, amirite? hailcorporate
There is plenty of water in Sacramento. The Sacramento River is California's principal river, and Sacramento is down at the end of it, where it meets the American River, another major waterway. Using water that has already made it to Sacramento is not going to affect drought conditions.
They own fucking Cyprus springs in Florida and there isn't shit built there. They haven't even attempted to harness the water that is BLASTING out of this thing. Like thousands of gallons an hour. All of the land around it is theirs. Yet they haven't built anything there...
....at some point it will get too ruthless and real for enough sheeple.....then guys like him will great at the end of a rope.
$2.25 per million litres, so they can sell it back to us at $2.25 per 5 litres.

Seems legit.
They used to get all their water for free.  Now they pay $2.25
[Nestle CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzaV8tg6hno) spoke back against the criticism against his view of privatising water.

He agrees that a specific amount of water (4-5 Litres per person per day) is a fundamental human right, but everything after that is not.  The fundamental flaw in this evil villains plan as he sucks the world dry, is that it is not just humans that need water, it is the whole planets ecosystem that relies on water.   To suck it out of Sacramento, bottle it and sell it to Saudi Arabia in a bottle is doing far more long term damage to the environment than any CO^2 emissions alone because not only are they draining water and not putting it back into the ecosystem, they are emitting CO^2 and using oil based plastics as well.

Water should have a price, but it should also have strict regulations to stop corporations from sucking the land dry.  Governments need to stand up world wide and protect their nations from these parasites.

shills...shills everywhere.

·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
I am pretty sure they are not selling water to them, but they are actually charging for the right to extract the water. Nestle uses their own private equipment, so the government isn't pulling water up and selling it to them. In fact, I'm fairly certain that they didn't even charge them for the right to extract in the past, and the only reason they started charging was to cover administrative fees. Having said that, I can completely understand your outrage.
The 'funny' thing about that is the government responded to the outrage over how little Nestle is paying for so much water by ACTUALLY saying that they're (the government) aren't in the business of selling water. But it's okay to give it to a company that'll sell it for ridiculous amounts.
Nestle isn't the only evil involved in this.
what is really sick is that various lab studies have show most city tap water to be of equal quality to bottled, without the 1200% markup.
I did a little research on this. I forget the municipality name but used it to gauge how much more individuals who actually depend upon water are paying. It was on the order of 325 times more than Nestle. If I were you, Sir, I'd be pissed. 
So in BC Canada, Nestle are taking 265 million liters a year and paying $2.25 per million liters, that is a mere $596.25.

In California, for 80 million gallons (302 million
liters) Nestle are paying $0.65 per 470 gallons (same as residents), that is $261,865.79 

See! Nestle should just double the amount in BC!!
 
Hold on, I'm in BC.... Mr Harper, what the hell is going on?
>Starting in 2016

... They're not currently paying anything at all.
The state dumped 70,000 acre-feet, or 23 BILLION gallons to [try to temporarily change the temperature of waterways by a few degrees](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304547704579565622649474370).

Farmers in california are subsidised and pay $300 for 325,000 gallons.  They then re-sell at many times what they paid.

And you're harping on about about Nestle?  Seriously?

Edit: I agree that there's a problem.  But the problem is that there isn't a proper market for water.  Government chooses favorites and then everyone else has shortages.  There would be no shortage if this nonsense wasn't taking place.  Nestle isn't the problem.
They were paying nothing to steal our water before. Its still terrible, but better than before.
So they have to sell like 1.2 bottles of water to cover the cost of the million liters. It's crazy that bottled water is so expensive. 
65 cents equals $307 per million litres
>"Nestl√© pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground"

Thats $0.0004 per 476 Gallons they pay in BC. (that's 0.04 cents).

Or the other way to look at it is Nestle pays $365 per million liters in the US
No, just don't buy anything Nestle period. Nestle anything is a nogo for me. Doesn't matter if it's Nestle pens or something. Quit paying money to corrupt people with plans like privatizing water.
Very seldom I do this, but when I do it's because it's ridiculously convenient. 

Example: buying a bottle of water at the airport after going through TSA for the flight.

Also, on vacation in places where the tap water is not great. e.g. va hotel room in Phoenix.
People like me who live in countries without clean water tend to buy bottled water because it is quicker than boiling than chilling if you want clean cold water
I bought an insulated Kleen Kanteen and haven't looked back. 
The school where I work got worried kids were putting vodka in the reusable water bottles.   Now you can't even bring one on campus.  No outside drinks either. 

But they can still bring the water bottles from the vending machine to class.   What's to stop them from bring in booze in an empty one hidden in their backpack you ask?  Fucking nothing!   

But no reusable bottles.  
some people with wells cant drink their water hence water bottle consumption



Can't avoid it, I live in Thailand, can't drink the water so water bottles EVERYWHERE. Kills me
I buy water bottled right here in my home town by a company that just pulls it from the tap and runs it through a set of filters that I simply don't have the time or room in my apartment to install. The bottles cost about 5¬¢ each at retail.

Mostly I'm paying for the bottle, the water inside the bottle is pretty much a negligible cost increase.

Aside from the plastic of the bottle (which gets recycled) and the limited amount of fuel needed to cart the stuff from across town to the grocery store, there is no more environmental impact than simply filling my cup from the tap. And if you include the amount of water needed to wash my cup after use, you could in theory say that it is less.

I buy it, because after they run it through the filters it tastes better than the over chlorinated water from my tap. When I run out of bottled water and just drink from the tap, at the end of the day I have a raw/sore throat from all the chlorine in my tap water.


Though I can't imagine buying some other bottled water which is actually transported hundreds or thousands of miles before consumption. That just seems dumb.
Because the pipes that pipe water into my city are garbage and weird stuff grows in it.

So, I buy 5gallon jugs from a local water supplier because our well water sucks (seriously, after 2 filters and a Brita it is still slightly opaque and tastes like rust). Its amazing how much we save buying the jugs and refilling our klean kanteens in comparison to what our friends spend on bottled water. And they always seem to have half empty bottles laying around and then noone knows whose bottle is who so it gets wasted. Its ridiculous.
That is the very best solution.  They are selling what sells.  Stop buying it and they stop selling it.  Anyone who buys bottled water in this day and age is kind of a doucher also.  

I remember in the 80s there was a movie called 'Heathers' about Christian slater bringing a gun to school and scaring jocks and a bunch of girls committing suicide.  In this movie, they made fun of bottled water and compared it to homosexuality.  Maybe they were on to something because fast forward, we have a ton more bottled water and also gay marriage.  So it's clear by correlation that bottled water makes you gay, but when you find that you are gay, that's when you should stop drinking the bottled water because the medicine has done its job and now you're just wasting it /s

I work at a grocery store and the amount of water people buy blows my mind. I was talking to someone last week and I said it's all water and all the same to me and she said, "I bet you still use tap water." My response was that yes, I do use tap water because it's cheaper, and in most cases, treated better than bottled water. Her response was that it tastes bad and something about government..etc It was ridiculous.

He's right in a lot of ways. If the price was higher, California wouldn't have such an issue right now. 

Sure, agriculture produce prices would skyrocket and certain crops would collapse into non profitability, but at this point in time water is so very very cheap we use it as if it could never deplete. 

Water is a finite resource priced like an almost unlimited resource. But it's agriculture and industry, not households that are doing the most damage. 
The coalition currently in power in my country (Norway) had said they wanted to privatize our freshwater lakes, as well as our hydroelectric plants if they got into power.   they did get into power, but so far that hasn't happened, but it makes me wonder what in the hell my countrymen were thinking. Probably "i don't like brown people" and "i want cheap alcohol" and "i want the tax that i dont pay to be lowered, for when i become a millionaire".

If you want to find out how well things go when very necessary things are deemed 'rights' and 'should be cheep or free for everyone', go visit Venezuela.


Water is a necessity.  It is one of the most important things for human survival.  And unfortunately, it doesn't just magically clean and deliver itself to people everywhere in sufficient quantities.  Work has to be done to get water from where it is to where people are, and in a state where it won't kill them.  Someone has to do that work.  And those someones won't do it without sufficient compensation to motivate them.

I can't speak to how valid Nestle prices their water, or the morality of their business model.  But the attitude that water, or any other necessity, should *not* be charged for is childish and leads to ruin.  Only a child can simultaneously claim that something is necessary and invaluable, and demand a price tag of $0.00 be put on it.
[deleted]
He's right. It's just that Nestle should be charged exponentially by volume used, not by flat residential rate.

> I'm pretty sure there is a Video on youtube of a Nestle CEO saying that he believes **collected, processed, and delivered** water is not a natural right, but a finite resource to be controlled, and sold.

FTFY.  There's a difference between "water" and "water that someone has gathered, cleaned, transported to you".

People don't have a right to the water from a bottling company any more than they have the right to the fruits of a farm.

Also, pricing encourages conservation and careful use.  

Before we put a price on pollution, the skies and rivers were very dirty, and cared for by no one.   The countries who have attached a monetary cost to those actions (through credits, fines, or fees), have become the cleanest countries in the world.  

If California would put a penalty on the waste of water (i.e. raise the price on people who are wasting it), they wouldn't have so much of a problem with that either.  Pricing is the most effective incentivisation tool possible when dealing with the demand of a resource, they should take advantage of that.
Holy shit, facts.  FWIW not only did I check your math, but I upvoted you.
To put it in perspective, the [Dos Amigos pumping station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dos_Amigos_Pumping_Plant) pumps 80 million gallons in 11 minutes, 32 seconds.

This should be the top comment.

Except residential use is not ground water.
Yeah, the problem is the idiocy of bottled water instead of using this new fangled invention called "the canteen".

Just because *you* are wealthy and healthy and have a long life expectancy doesn't mean *everyone* else is! And he's in charge of millions of human beings. In my opinion It's not business at this point it's just psychotic.

They bought the permission.
You mean we can vote in the other set of politicians also supported by the same corporations? 
its the classic approach, let everything turn to shit by intentional neglect or direct interference, then declare it a failure and let your buddy's company privatize it while telling us all how this will be great for us all.
Our town had a pristine water supply that they let go to ruin and gave into another source that was privatized. This is because our city counsel is a hotbed of corruption and had designs on using the waterfront property from our city reservoirs to make high dollar real estate out of it. 

They destroyed not only our own water supply that had minimum farm run off taint to it, but also destroyed a revenue stream and jobs for the town. Now we get gouged for water from a cesspool of farm run off. 

This whole Rightwing dogma of "privatization is good, all hail capitalism" will be the doom of us all. 
Part of the reason there is a water shortage is that there isn't enough rationing going on. So it's great that you can get water for $15 a month, until you can't get it at all. 
So by paying attention to our pubic areas are we referring to shaving or trimming?
Privatization in the water sector doesn't necessarily mean "operating to make ever increasing profit." More often than not in means "not operating at a loss," which is very common for many public utilities. What you don't seem to understand is that *some* privatization is definitely a good thing for the water sector, and few people seriously debate that point.

Say you want to build a multi-billion dollar desalination plant in order to provide a long term water resource solution for your city. It is a major investment backed by taxpayer dollars, and as such, you want the project to be a success. 

So who do you get to design the plant? Do you round up some publicly employed city engineers who have no expertise in designing desalination plants? No. You contract the design out to a private firm that specializes in designing desalination plants and has a proven track record of it. 

So who you get to build the plant? Do you get the government to round up some city employed day laborers and have them look at some blueprints and just them have at it? No. You contract the construction out to a private firm that has built desalination plants before and has a proven track record of it. 

Let me be clear here: Almost *no one* who knows anything about the water sector disagrees that private firms should be involved in those stages of the desalination plant's life. The real controversy is over whether private firms should be involved in the operating and maintaining of water/wastewater plants. And I'll be the first to admit that there are many instances where private firms have fucked up. But just as many (if not more) public utilities fuck up all the time too. The truth is that there's no blanket solution on how to properly run a water utility, but few people recognize that fact. Saying all privatization is bad is just ideological nonsense. 

My last point is this: Your water bill is low. Besides the fact that it's an anecdote and we know nothing about where you live or how much you consume, why do you think water should be so cheap? When something has an artificially low price, that encourages wasteful consumption. And water is not something we should waste. Having big green, grassy lawns and taking half hour long showers are almost exclusively American phenomenons. If your water bill is too high, 90 percent of the time the problem is you, not your water company.

**TL;DR: Not all privatization is bad.** 

 

   
pubic utilities eh
I don't think water should be so cheap.   It encourages waste.   If we are worried about poorer folks having a hard time getting by put it on a sliding scale per capita.   Break it into tiers like income.  

I think there should be a dramatic increase in price between the point where your use is drinking and bathing and the level where people are watering lawns and maintaining pools.   
 
> My water comes from a public-non-profit utility. My bill for the last month was $15. The month before that was $13. Public utilities exist for the service of the community and quality of life. 

This is a good point. There are multiple models to run things, and you should choose a model based on what your objective is.

Right now most municipalities have public water. The system is designed to provide water for a low price, and it works. If you change the system to a privatized model you're going to see the pricing structure change from a low monthly fee to cover costs to whatever the market will bear. Since people need water the cost will become very high because people will pay it. This will reap massive profits for companies like Nestle. 

It will become similar to healthcare in the US. The price is high because you have to buy it. You really have no choice.
While I don't doubt you are right, do you have a source for that?
No, the argument being made in the article is that they are paying residential water service rates and not the higher rates that businesses are supposed to pay.  Different businesses also pay different rates from other businesses:

http://portal.cityofsacramento.org/Utilities/Services/Water-Service

http://www.waterresources.saccounty.net/scwa/Documents/Title%203_3.50_Rates%20and%20Fees.pdf (links directly to PDF)
The problem is that Nestle is arguing that the price of water should be higher, you know, to encourage conservation. They claim that the price is too low.

But you can be sure that they're not going to want to pay higher costs themselves. They're going to want a setup where they are buying water much cheaper than residents can buy their water, so they can resell it to those residents for a higher price. 

They will claim to be the gatekeepers to conservation. They'll claim that their higher prices are making people conserve water. Really their objective is just to extract more profit.
Even 80 million gallons is only a large pond's worth. Compare that to the amount that goes into small agricultural plots of land, and it really is very little, indeed. Some Californians seem to love to point the finger of blame at big name companies - but in this case, it's everybody's actions together that is causing the demand in the drought. No one organization is at fault. Instead of drumming up umbrage, people should be thinking together how they are going to deal with the problem. I'm particularly concerned about people who have orchards that took years to grow into mature trees. 
I live in Lausanne, Switzerland.

In my sink I have water from the same Evian mountains were the Evian water comes.

Most people here are not able to distinguish a glass of sink water to Evian water.

Still, everybody here keeps buying bottled water.

Fuck yes. Go build it.
Good point and urban use pales in significance to agricultural. 
I've got a bridge to sell you.
They still pump and bottle it, regardless of you purchasing it. They probably have warehouses full of bottled water. In corporate-morality, if a resource is scarce....get as much of it as you can while you can.
Buy a filter for them and do a blind test. It might not work, but it's worth a try.
So your suggestion is that they drink salt water?
you shouldnt be feeding that to your dog for health reasons, not because it's nestle
It's difficult.  They produce *a lot* and their creamer is like 1/3 the price of the next cheapest one.
Hope you don't eat in restaurants.
On the other hand, if water was privatized California wouldn't be in as drastic a position as it is.
that rain falling down....well make sure not to drink none....and if you do make sure to mail nestle the appropriate funds
Desalination plants.
Not to mention the 3 cents per bottle environmental cost **we** have to pay. (I'm not talking about the refundable 5 cent deposit, but the separate non-refundable 3 cent fee).

How ironic is it that the government recognizes the environmental impact of plastic bottles but it's the consumer that has to pay while the company gets off totally free.

If you think about it - let's say a million litres makes 2 million 500mL bottles. At 3 cents each, we're paying $60,000 in environmental fees to buy those bottles. While it cost Nestle just $2.25 to sell it to us.
5 liters? Try 500ml.
don't buy it
They apparently go by the old restaurant wine rule of selling it by the glass for what you paid for the whole bottle.
Where exactly do you go that you can get 5 litres for $2.25? Costs that much for like a 591mL.
5 litres? I assume you mean if buying in bulk? I don't think I've ever seen an individual bottle cheaper than like 1$ or $1.50, and I'm sure they can get up higher than that at a lot of places.
> Seems legit.

Sadly it is legit.

Yeah, I'm not sure why anybody even listens to CEOs. Their public statements only represent what would make the company the most money. There is no morality at all in their comments, and any mentions of "morality" are just efforts to get you to give them money.
That guy is fucking terrifying. In another video he says something like "There are two beliefs about water: one that it should be free for everyone, and one that it should be privatized." False dichotomies coming out of the mouth of a guy like that scares the shit out of me. Nobody is saying water should be 100% free! It ABSOLUTELY should be and remain a CHEAP, PUBLIC UTILITY. You can bottle water and sell it to the idiots who buy bottled water, but you shouldn't be able to suck that water from a drought zone.

> To suck it out of Sacramento, bottle it and sell it to Saudi Arabia in a bottle is doing far more long term damage to the environment than any CO2 emissions alone because not only are they draining water and not putting it back into the ecosystem, they are emitting CO2 and using oil based plastics as well.

Umm.... have you heard of this thing called "the water cycle"? Barring negligible amounts left in space outside the gravity well or binding it into something non-degradable (burning or cremating would free it) you can't get rid of water.
[deleted]
There is a far larger effect on the ecosystem in both water usage and GHG emissions from selling USA made blue jeans to Saudi Arabia than bottled water. Bottled water has caused 0 ecosystem disasters in all of human history. You would be better off banning farming.

the problem with nestle is they are a huge corporation buying the rights to natural water worldwide, You can only imagine what kind of prices people will be paying for water in the future once they have acquired all the natural springs. You may be drinking water from india, china, africa, where the water contains high acid levels and pollutants and have to be treated more intensely to make it "safe" to drink, however the treatment process does not actually make that water safer then our own tap water, and in many cases actually worse because of it's origin and the use of extra chemicals to treat.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZXSEa7nG-E  |  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEFL8ElXHaU  |  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QndYLT-8DM  |  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZcnflfJ3u4  |  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV-eBPFrxSI  Our government is spineless and should impose a more significant tax on companies like nestle, in fact if they want to sell that right to nestle it should be more along the lines of 5-10% of the value of 1 bottled water with a cap on how much you could pay. people are slowly getting robbed of their right to potable water and are actually contributing to the pollution of this planet with all those empty bottles.
You're paying for the infrastructure and not the water. They're going to have their own wells just like every brewery etc.
Oh yes you're right corporations are saints, the state is evil and we have nothing to worry about then

You can always buy a bottle that has a filter built in. I bought one while in Florida because their tap water tastes like a swimming pool.  
You could always bring a water bottle and then fill it up at a water fountain once you go through the gate :)
Surely they could buy local water by the gallon or 5, instead of little Dasanis and Fiji's.
As a Canadian with a well, what? 
Surely a filter system would be cheaper?
Put a filter on your sink. It does wonders. The bottled water comes from city pipes too.
I don't think he was referring to developing nations, but rather he was referring to [this bullshit] (http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/2013/07/17/b611c8de8750357bbafb7804bfa273f7.jpg?itok=hs1VHcfQ)
What's craziest about the bottled water craze is that it's counter to the environment **and** to people's own pocketbooks. Why the heck would you pay $1 for water that you can get for basically 0 cents from any tap?

The more smog in the sky, the more people will buy!
No, it is priced like an infinite resource, except people who would never deplete a water reserve are charged hundreds to thousands of times more than entities that can deplete it, like agriculture and water bottling. 
> He's right in a lot of ways.

But why should a single private and unaccountable entity gather up all that profit from water?  It makes absolutely no sense.  Why should Nestle be allowed to take control of water?  What or who gives it such privilege?

I don't think water should be priced or privatized at all.  At best it should be rationed and regulated.

But even if we wanted to put a price on water, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to designate some arbitrary corporation to profit from that.
[deleted]
Except the government who prices it like that is the one really doing damage. Firms just react to prices. If there was a system that connected price and availability like a free market one, this insane shit would never happen.
[deleted]
Not really, at the chemical and molecular level water is an infinite resource, we have a closed atmosphere and matter cannot be completely destroyed. If you drink water, you piss water out / sweat water out as vapors and it all ends up back in the environment.

NOW CLEAN drinkable water is a different story, however there are methods to make just about any level of toxic water drinkable, however those methods can be very expensive... 

With enough time and money water can be infinite forever, and if it ever came to the point we were desperate enough to start pulling water from the atmosphere regularly and using salt water, cleaning toxic water / all the expensive methods that are usually overlooked we will never run out of water.  There are also methods for the synthesis / conversion of other chemicals that are extremely abundant into H2O / there are bacteria and plant life that do this regularly as well.  
 
Water may become more expensive than everyone can afford but it will never run out. 

Hell, look at the mini ecosystems people build in glass bottles... They never need to add water and some are over 100 years old because it recycles its-self. 
At some point preserving water is going to have to supersede preserving the status quo.

People whose income is derived from high-water demand crops in CA should seriously look at alternatives.  Anybody who gets caught with their pants down simply had their head in the sand and wasn't paying attention.

Survive ability = Adaptability  
That's not what he's saying. He's saying he should decide the price.
Says the company taking advantage of this fact to turn a profit at the expense of the public. If the price is going to be somehow inflated or regulated, it should be done so by an organisation or body that is at lay supposed to be operating in the people's best interest. 
I do not think that he's right. He's trying to apply a flawed economic model on a renewable resource like water. He's trying to create artificial scarcity even in places where none currently exists so his company can make a disproportional profit off it. You can be sure that under his plan, entities such as Nestle would still be able to acquire water cheaply, and the higher price (ostensibly to encourage conservation) would only be applied after bottling. And no surprise, this would drive a massive profit.
water is technically infinite as long as we don't shoot it off into space. It doesn't disapear like gasoline or coal.
That's why I'm glad I live in Chicago. Bless you, Lake Michigan. Also it looks like an ocean and we even get waves you can surf on!

I'm fully against global warming but if it is inevitable at least I live somewhere that won't flood, has freshwater, and will get warmer winters. 
Think about it this way : if there was a limited supply of water, in a way that there was just enough for sustainable consumption for everyone if it was split evenly, then a State-controlled distribution (which is objectively better than free-for-all, see tragedy of commons) according to the principle that water is a human right would lead to a greater common good than if it was privately controlled and sold in the marketplace, because then the poor could not compete to get their share.

Therefore, water should be a basic human right and access to water for basic survival needs should *never* cost anything, and the CEO of Nestle is a wanna be mass-murderer.
Wait, we're exporting Republicans now?
Er, hydroelectric schemes have sold by municipalities to foreign investment under previous Labour coalitions too, btw. Nothing new about that. http://www.bt.no/na24/Utlendinger-satser-n-milliard-i-norske-fosser-1850349.html
The part I don't understand about this is that water is not currently free. I pay a water bill. I already pay to subsidize the water treatment and piping to my house.

Nestle simply wants to gain control of the water so they can create artificial scarcity and charge more for it. They'd like to be the "OPEC" of water.
If you live in the US, Nestle owns Ovaltine too.
I hate to tell you this but they make Ovaltine out of the bones of little orphan annie.,
Few claim that a price tag of 0.00 should be put on it. 

We pay taxes for a reason. That's the whole fucking point. To build things, at a reasonable cost, with no intention of a conflict of interest in the service in the name of increasing profit. 
Water doesn't need to be provided solely on the capital gained from usage of water. A society provides many services such as the protection of a police force or public education from the capital gained by other means. Public education is necessary, invaluable, and "free" in the sense you think water shouldn't be.
Yep. What's happening in Venezuela is a perfect example. "Evil capatitalist" were "hording supplies", so the goverment goes and siezes the assets and distributes them, yay! Everyone got only as much as they needed! And for free even! Now no one will import anything or work for anything because of the fear that it will just get siezed and given away. They even jailed the owners of the business that employed people distributing the goods. Now not only are there no goods, there is no supply chain and no one to distribute them. 
Water professional here. Can confirm. These hundred million dollar treatment plants don't build themselves.
That's fine, so maybe we should quit selling it to Nestle at the super cheap "treat it like its unlimited" price.  That, to me, is the real problem.  Nestle vacuums it up for next to nothing (fucking the region they get it from long term), and then sells it at what they deem to be market prices.  if Nestle was made to pay a market price to begin with they might be less motivated to hoover it all up.
But it's not like I get my water for free. I already do pay for it. I pay to have it cleaned and piped to me. 

Nestle is trying to muscle their way into the equation so they can insert themselves between the low price we currently pay and the higher price they want to charge. 
If only society could get together and pool their money for a common benefit? Let's call it taxes.
[deleted]
But they aren't paying a "flat rate". They are charged per 1000 gallons, at the same price (per 1000 g) that residential customers are.  Which is actually pretty surprising. Most business in CA pay less per gallon than residential users.
And I'm not selling my water.
Fortunately, those are coming back into style. Also, Girl Scouts is trying to nip that bottled water habit at an early age. All girls are expected to have a canteen or a reusable water bottle and fore go disposable water bottles.

Problem with canteens is they always have a smell.  Aluminum and Stainless is pretty bad, titanium is super duper expensive but it's the best and doesn't have a smell.   

The best thing is, and this will surprise you, *glass*.  Yep, just clean out a beer bottle or wine bottle with a cork.  If it breaks, there are countless others.  Its infinitely recyclable, unlike plastic *or* metal.
I do because I want to. You are worse than retarded.
Yeah actually people do need water in those packs because they dont want to carry around a fucking gallon or drink from a fountain. Ugh. You cant get mad at people buying a product because california decided to build a major metropolitan area in the middle of a desert. Me buying poland springs doesn't contribute to the depletion of the colorado river guy. 
I think that Nestle is actually the top of the food chain. Both Wiki and [this Huffpost article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/consumer-brands-owned-ten-companies-graphic_n_1458812.html) show Nestle as the top. Haven't really cared to dig deeper, though.

United States Postal Service....right now.
just did a quick google search, according to the EPA, [the average household uses 400 gallons a day](http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/pubs/indoor.html) and [census.gov reports over 12 million households in ca](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06000.html). That's nearly 5 billion gallons a day from household use alone. Farms and industry use more.
I used wikipedia to do some math, and found that Cali uses 2.653 trillion gallons per year (for urban usage only). This comes out to 7.269 billion gallons per day. It's not difficult to see that agriculture would use up the remaining 27 billion to get to the 34 billion figure.
Exactly. California tried to get Californians to decrease their water usage by 20%, but LA residents actually increased their water usage by 12%, an amount that's probably measured in the hundreds of billions of gallons. Blaming Nestle is the easy thing to do. Maybe its just reddit, but everyone loves to throw circlejerk hate against big companies.
"I can't be bothered to keep up with a reusable water bottle to carry around with me!"
Do you recycle the bottles?
Buy real cream. It's a LOT better for you than Nestle's fake cream.
Blek. Diabetes cream.
Rarely.
It is almost as if the government is empowering the corporations at the expense of the people... but that would never happen because...
Why do you have to pay 3c? What happens if you don't buy it?
If the consumer doesn't want to pay for it, they don't have to buy products that come in plastic bottles. That would hit the companies in the only place they feel it - the wallet.
I agree with your post right up to where you say it costs them $2.25.  That's just the cost of the water.  You have facilities, equipment/machinery and labor costs as well that no one here has yet mentioned.  

I'm not defending the current sale price of water to them and believe it should be higher considering it's not being used to produce anything except what it already is.
Because demand is causing the problem, not supply.

The idea of making you pay the tax is to incentivize you to not use water bottles. It's a behavioral economics concept. And yes, it works quite well. 
You are being stupid. There is absolutely zero economic long run effect of the choice between the consumer paying the fee or the producer paying the fee. This is basic economics. It is not ironic whatsoever.
It encourages the consumer to recycle.  
This. Problem solved immediately. As in everything, make change at an individual level by deciding not to purchase bottled water. 
Yeah I know.  He didn't withdraw his view though, he tried to clarify it and in my opinion it just made him seem even worse than before.  The original video could have been taken out of context, but with that video that I just linked, the context is clear.  He is completely absorbed in the idea of absolutes and does not take into account how much water the rest of the non-human life on earth needs.  I don't know what's worse, companies like Nestle hoarding water like a dragon with gold, or Coal, Oil and Gas companies poisoning the water aquifers with drilling, fracturing or coal washing.
That's not even the half of it.  These corporations provide jobs and will threaten the government with mass redundancies.  They don't need to bribe them, they just use legal extortion tactics.
Why are people who buy bottled water idiots?
Naming a greater threat doesn't make the former any less of a threat.  You may as well save us the time and proceed to directly to Reductio ad Hitlerum. 
Today I learned I don't use a single Nestle product without even knowing it.
There goes the occasional hot pocket, tombstone pizza, and misc baking supplies off my list.
> Kit Kat¬†(except in the¬†United States, where it is a¬†Hershey'sproduct)

This seems so strange! I wonder what the story is here.


*Et tu, Hot Pockets?*
Holy. Shit. 
Not the Hot Pockets! Oh why do they have to own hot pockets!
Only 3 of those things on that list I sometimes buy. I was really nervous for some reason. 
Fuck, they own Maggi. :(

edit: AND HOT POCKETS?? wtf else am i supposed to eat when I hate myself and want to pound 2 40 oz in a night?
Holy shit. They're everywhere.
god damn you shienhardt wig corporation!
Make a list of Nestle products exclusive to each country, spread it around on what not to buy. Post it on twitter

I think that would do some damage
More to the point, they co-pack for hundreds of other brands, especially water. Co-packing is what we call the act of producing or packaging a product for a brand name other than our own. Sometimes it's even a competitor's product. For example, Sunsweet Growers makes a lot of their own prune juice, but they also package Gatorade, Powerade, Ocean Spray fruit juices, and Snapple. When the juice and ingredient systems are being sanitized, they occasionally bottle water.

Nestle in Sacramento bottles HUNDRED of brands, including most store brands found in California and Nevada. I can only think of 3 major brands they don't bottle: Fiji, Evian, and Pellegrino. Even the "spring" water they bottle (Arrowhead and Nestle Pure Life are [bottled in the same facility from the same source](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101892496) ) is often local tap water.

Side note: 'Evian' backwards spells 'naive', also a French word. That can't be a coincidence...they started the premium bottled water craze in the 80s.

Source: I'm an engineer in the food manufacturing and packaging industry in northern California.
Aside from frozen pizza, my cart is Nestle free!  That's an easy change for me to make!
It's not that hard to buy real food and not phony packaged crap.
Oh please. I went through that entire list in about 2 minutes. Not only have I not purchased a single one of those brands in like the last 10 years, but half of that shit doesn't even seem to be sold in the US. It is *not* hard to boycott nestle. Dafuq is Gold Flakes?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Which is why a large amount of people not buying their products would be very harmful. their spread across the market is very large and if we can close in their market share we can restrict their political pull.
Most of the ice cream, frozen convenience entrees, pet food, and more. It's in our best interest to learn the names and boycott. 
If one would have to make a science out of a full boycott, avoiding some of their products is better than nothing.
>Hot Pockets

Those sons of bitches
Any suggestions on brands? This is the first I am hearing of these bottles and would love one before my next trip to Florida (you are right, the water is horrible there).
Sigh..... Florida checking in. Our water tastes horrible
First thing I do after going through security is finding the water fountain to fill up my bottle. 
A filter system dosent get rid of all health hazards from potentialy contaminated water.
The home we live in has 2 filters (not cheap ones either) and we use a Brita. We still have rusty water. It just so happens that where its situated has what multiple water technicians and specialists have called "the worst water they have seen". Its fine to bathe in and wash things in once its filtered, but its not tasty for consumption. So what we do is buy water in 5gallon jugs from a local company and refill those monthly. It is pretty cheap, and we use refillable water bottles to drink out of. We don't love in the middle of nowhere either, its just where we live have sucky water. Our neighbors have to do the same thing. 
Sometimes even though it's cheaper in the long run it's not always possible. My parents live on a well with super high salt content. They buy bottled water for drinking and some dish washing whenever the system breaks and it does. Also the last owners didn't put a system in to filter as they were bottled water 100% of the time. So my parents ended up on bottled for about a year after moving because the system cost a ton and they were waiting to do a renovation anyway.

The other problem that occurs is situations where the salt content is so bad it wrecks the systems quickly and in that case it isn't cheaper. This went on outside my home town to where companies actually stopped installing the systems just so they wouldn't have to service the things as the failure rate was so high.

So why do people live where the salt content is so high that water is undrinkable? Answer is honestly because water testing and health concerns are always developing in addition to older cottages being turned into year-round homes. Outside my home town the houses were built before we knew what massive salt intake can do over a long period, turns out it's pretty unhealthy. They aren't going to tear down the houses now. In my parents case it's a former cottage on top of the previous statement. Who cares when you only live there 2 months out of the year right? Well now the original subdivision cottage owners are retiring to their cottages and drinking that stuff 12 months of the year, older and more health conscious they want to drink it and not have issues.

All of these could be fixed with behavior modifications (don't live in bad places) but it's reality.
That is why you buy bottled "Spring Water", not "Purified". Purified comes from city pipes usually.
> Why the heck would you pay $1 for water that you can get for basically 0 cents from any tap?

Not all tap water is created equally. I'll gladly drink tap water where it's actually clean. But I've lived in places were it wasn't.

For example, the last place I lived, there were main breaks all the time. That makes the water completely undrinkable at least temporarily. More times than I can count we had brown, filthy tap water because of it. Furthermore, the tap water often smelled like sewage. It was vile, had a vile smell and a vile taste.

We filtered the water where possible, but still had to buy bottled water. 

Remember, water is only as clean as the pipes it travels through to get to you. If the utilities/government does not properly maintain those pipes, they can get pretty damn filthy. 
Its cold and i didn't bring a bottle. Australian summer makes both hot and cold taps just hot taps.
Well numerous reasons (whether valid or perceived)

- Mostly convenience. A plastic bottle allows you to carry a drink that also serves as the container from which to consume it. It's also an easy way to serve water, to stock water, to sell water from a vending machine etc etc etc. Whether that's water or another drink like coke, orange squash or beer is moot. The concept of the "drink in a bottle" is clearly not going to disappear and a market exists for it

- Fears about water supply safety. Probably mostly unfounded, but companies selling water have traded on this notion of purity. This is certainly a thing escalated by increased foreign travel in the modern age (few would consider drinking the water on vacation abroad and buying bottled water in this scenario was a thing years before it became popular in countries that probably have a equally safe, if not safer and certainly significantly cheaper piped water supply than that in the bottles)

- Health reasons. Again, probably mostly unfounded, but companies selling water have traded on the notion of health benefits. Minerals in the water, or things not in the water, or it being 'natural' 
I live by a dump and the water that comes out of my tap smells like trash.

You can have some if you want, but I'll just have a bottle.
You pay for the convenience of the bottle.
Water bottling is nowhere on the same level as agriculture. The average North American is using around 300 liters water per day. The 1-2 liters you drink barely make any difference. Breweries use way more water than a water bottling plant.
Who determines what the right amount of rationing is and how do you propose we regulate it without putting a price on it?
it's your government doing it.

vote in smart people.
The fact that they went in, bought the rights to the area around the spring, and drilled a water well. This article is so bias it's almost cringe worthy to read. Equally as cringe worthy is the amount of armchair Redditors who think they know something about land and mineral rights. The ignorance is sickening.
It makes perfect sense. They buy the water, filter it, and sell cleaner water that people want. If no one bought it, they wouldn't do it. They do the same thing with coffee and chocolate. It's a business.
I wonder what it would be like if DeBeers sold water instead of diamonds.
Poli sci 101? If you were an Environmental major, it was in every.single.class god fucking dammit I learned about the tragedy of the commons a lot
> Nestle's CEO might be a sociopath, but he knows how these systems work.

He knows what would make them a profit. You'd never hear a statement from him that goes against Nestle's bottom line.
Oh yes, many of them are even die-hard Reagan and Thatcher fans, actually.

There's a range of different political parties in Norway, and on the conservative side of the fence, there's different degrees of conservatism going on. You have the more mainstream party, simply called H√∏yre (lit: Right) and you have another party that's not as popular, but sadly quite popular with many people all the same, which is called Fremskrittspartiet (lit: The Progress Party) and they're mostly made up of hardcore reagan / thatcher fans, who masturbate to Netanyahu speeches and want to privatize all the things, and try to fearmonger about immigration and all that.

Right now several of our ministers is from FRP, but most of the power is in the hands of H√∏yre, which is still bad in my opinion, but it's not so bad that we're going to be irreparably ruined by them, hopefully.

That said, every time a conservative government is elected, they seem to manage to privatize something new. Some times that's a good thing, and other times it turns a decent service into ebola laced diarrhea, and it can some times be hard to tell which is going to be which until it's too late. And by too late I mean that once something has been privatized, it's very hard to get that genie back in the bottle.
Water is free if you have a well, like Nestle does.
Unless the government provision of water is solely paid for by a *per-gallon* tax rather than a per-household tax or a per-person tax, taxes are *not at all* like a 'price tag' in many important respects. Per-person or per-household taxes don't adequately address the 'one person takes a bathtub's worth, one person takes a swimming pool's worth' tragedy-of-the-commons problem.
'Teaching' isn't a scarce resource in the same way that water is.  Though it does require money to pay for the building, the teachers, and the supplies, it isn't something people can use incrementally.  Kid's won't go to only two of their 6 classes.  Or maybe attend an extra 6 classes.  Utilization of the resource is very different.  'Education" is not something people will consume more or less of in a direct manner.

If you say: "Here is water - it's necessary so it's free!" then people will have no consequence for using a thimbleful of water, or filling an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day.  The cost of utilizing the water is not tied to their usage directly.  They may waste or save the water, insulated from the real-world consequences of their behavior.  There is no incentive to conserve water.  And there is little or no incentive for the water providers to find new and more efficient methods to produce more potable water.
True.  As I said, their business model isn't particularly what I was defending - only the notion that necessities still need prices tied to them.  I would point out that the low prices we pay tend to be *artificailly low* and we reap the consequences in depletion and unsustainable usage, like in California.  Which will lead to rationing and higher taxes - which unfairly spreads the burden between under-consumers and over-consumers of water.

When prices are unmanipulated, it communicates the scarcity of the product, incentivizes its consumers to consume less and incentivizes people to produce more of the good simultaneously.  These 'market forces' converge to help fix the situation, and drive consumption and production to a more optimal state based on the needs and desires of the consumers.  

When you start distorting the prices, you end up with situations where people feel an artificially smaller cost to over-consuming, and inventors spend their time fixing other problems, even when this one is more important.
I didn't mean "flat rate" in that sense (OK, I probably misused the term). Just that residential users have tiered rates and pay more the more water they use.
And that's why he's complaining. He thinks you're getting water too cheaply. He knows he could charge you more and you'd pay it.
Ironic that GS has sold its cookie flavor to Nestle to market in coffee creamers.
I'm a fan of [these](http://www.gocontigo.com/catalog/product/view/id/920/s/20-oz-fit-autoseal-water-bottle/category/60/)

Got two at Costco for like $15 I think.

These things are insulated, I've left it in the car during hot weather for hours and I still come back to cold water. Never had a metallic taste with them. 

I've gone through a number of plastic and metal water bottles, these by far have been the best.
Any aluminum one should be fine
[Liberty Bottleworks](http://www.libertybottles.com/Products/Apparel/Available/true?display=grid) makes some pretty badass bottles, and the lids can be hung with carabiners like a canteen.  All recycled material, made in the USA (if that matters to you).
Just buy a nalgene brother. It's nearly unbreakable. It's lightweight. And you don't look like a weirdo with a glass bottle on your hip... in your hand? Oh and it holds more water :)
Wht makes aluminum bad?
Yup. Nestle is one of [the big 10.](https://veroniquepalmer.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/food-giants.jpg)

Edit: It may not be up to date but gives you a pretty good idea overall on who (cause they're people!) owns what.
All hail Lofwyr
I'm not so sure about "a lot of us" being accurate, cuz there are a disturbing amount of people who are terrified of GMO and they [don't even know what it means](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/09/jimmy-kimmel-gmo_n_5958264.html). 

I'm still glad you aren't lobbing GMO and Monsanto together, regardless of how many others may be. :)

Stop free-thinking there Maverick. Someone has to pay for their shit stain campaigns...
Many politicians who claim they're adamantly against socialism are outright liars. Most of them are all for socialism, just not the kind of socialism that helps the general population. Instead of socializing the costs and the benefits, they socialize the costs and privatize the benefits.
You are right, of course. Why anyone buys bottled water except in a pinch in Canada is beyond me. 
Almost everyone in the first world already pays for water infrastructure to deliver fresh water right to their homes, so when Nestle is siphoning everyone's water into their own expensive bottles, mentioning their equipment costs is kind of missing the point, I think.
It used to cost them nothing. The $2.25 was added to cover the costs of the 2014 Water Sustainability Act.

http://www.vancouversun.com/news/metro/charge+bottling+million+litres+groundwater/10791463/story.html
He would monetize air if it was possible. His argument for setting a price on water is not about conservation, but allowing him to decide how much it should cost.
It constrains the threat. If bottled water does less damage than any nameable industry or agricultural product then it is probably not on the priority list for caring about. 

My argumentation comes from the same line of reasoning as the "You are more likely to be killed by a bee than a shark." Yes, maybe someone still shouldn't go in the ocean, but if they are still going to the meadow they are likely irrational.
If you're going by that list it stated "over 2000 brands". I looked through the whole list on the Wiki page and there weren't over 2000 brands listed. 
Me too, but I don't eat most shit. I don't think any of their pet foods are good for pets.
those were not healthy choices anyway.  =)

Honestly, it doesn't even make a difference at this point...
It does seem very strange, but it's actually more common than you may think. 
The brand was expanding from the UK after WWII, and licensed it to Hershey's in the US. Perhaps because they didn't have the resources and distribution themselves to enter the US market properly. Nestle inherited the licensing agreement when it bought the original company behind Kit Kat.
Maybe you should try alabaman hot pocket instead next time. 
Use the app buycott and scan for nestle products
"'Evian' backwards spells 'naive'",

I've been telling people this for twenty years.

Agreed the list of crap they make is big but it's only a problem if you buy a lot of processed food. However making pizza at home is actually super easy and the quality i would say is as good as if not better than frozen pizzas!
There's tons of documentaries about this
That's the point of the website. But why previous poster used it,  idk.
It's just that it isn't as simple as "don't buy Nestle", because it isn't always obvious what Nestle *is*. Boycotting Nestle is fine and all, it's just that avoiding the Nestle label superficially won't actually accomplish that. They also have a nearly monopolistic position in some products like baby foods but that is a separate matter.
http://www.waterbobble.com/
I personally just picked up a Brita bottle at a wall mart while I was there. They're about $10 for the bottle which comes with a filter.  
This is true, I live in a town where mining back in the day pretty much destroyed the water supply in areas and even with the best filtration system money can buy the water is still not potable, best you can do is shower and wash cloths with it. 
Yeah, I can see how that would suck, sorry to hear it
I used to drink tap water, until I moved. Water in my hometown tastes what Id imagine the Devils cock to taste like. Bottled water doesn't have that same 'demon jizz' feel to it. 
>Fears about water supply safety. Probably mostly unfounded, but companies selling water have traded on this notion of purity.

Fun fact: At least in the U.S., tap water is [more stringently regulated](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/09/09greenwire-fewer-regulations-for-bottled-water-than-tap-g-33331.html) than bottled water.
All of those are great reasons to drink water from a bottle - just not reasons to pay for it over and over again. You can buy a bottle and fill it at home, where presumably the water is trustworthy.

That does indeed sacrifice convenience though, as you need to wash the bottle, remember to fill it, and carry it with you before and after drinking it. It just surprises me what some people will pay for convenience. I guess I'm just cheap.

Grew up on well water and can say health reasons, even in the US, can be a real thing.  When my daughter was 3 months old she came down with a very nasty bacterial infection.  I was supplementing with formula due to feeding issues and used the filtered well water.  After a week in the hospital and tons of tests the Dr tells me what they believe it to be and likely it was in the water.  I was told to switch to bottled water. I've never knowingly had an issue with the well and we no longer use bottled, but if the doctor tells me there is a health concern I'm going to believe him.

Our well is also an acquired taste.  Most people don't like it, and some won't drink it.  It reeks of sulfur half the time and usually is whitish (lots of calcium). It's also fully loaded with rust.  We go through two or three shower heads a year, despite regular cleaning. The toilet has dark orange stripes, faucets get crusted with orange circles in the sinks.  The tea pots are the best (have to get a new one like once a year) they get layers of sediment.  Put the filtered in the tea pot and that does take out most of the rust, so the layers vary from hard bone white, to dusty grayish, to more of a soft slimy almost yellow.  I don't blame people for not drinking it. It would make a good point for the "I'm not a local" argument.
Agriculture is something like 80% of the water usage in California. Fixing your toilet and getting rid of the golf courses is great, but it's not going to solve the problem.
[deleted]
Nestle is getting the exposure here because people already hate bottled water. Having worked in food processing the amount of water we use just to clean justified our own water tower. 
> Breweries use way more water than a water bottling plant.

Holy shit. I live in CO, which as most of you know is a very environmentally aware state. I'm pretty sure our state has close to the most microbreweries in the country, so that fact is pretty ironic.
Leave beer the fuck out of this.
Hopefully the voters and not the shareholders.
They are smart. Their motives are not in the interests of the citizens. There are no candidates for office who are competent and ethical. So, there's literally nothing we can do. It's not like I could run for office, I don't know what to do. 
Problem is there are way more stupid people then smart people these days so voting generally doesn't mean shit.

The people in government are very smart.

They just don't give a rat's ass about the "voters" because they aren't the ones who get them elected and pay the bills.
Except they don't sell cleaner water. Tap water has much stricter regulations on impurities and are well known to be much cleaner than bottled water. They are only selling the convenience of bottled water.

Tell her you love her with this shotglass of water.

Only 7 months salary will truly say "drink up, bitch."
Well, similar to other public resources, we must control the amount that is used per capita. People can't carry off park benches, and government cheese is rationed to those who need it. Providing people with the water required for their basic survival shouldn't be conflated with making all water freely available. There is a middle ground between absolute, unrestricted water usage provided for everyone and absolute capitalistic control over an invaluable resource.
What makes the current price underpriced? As far as I know, the price I pay keeps the water treatment plant running. 

The problem with privatizing public utilities is that it creates local monopolies. If Nestle took over your water supply and began charging $100 a month what could you do about it? They're the only game in town. 

It's not a Girl Scout vendetta against nestle, it's just GSs thinking that bottled water is probably not the best idea.

What really chafes my ass about the stupid GMO debate is that there is a legitimate reason to regulate GMO crops for ecological reasons. But the idea of there being "toxins" is so incredibly stupid it's warped the debate beyond reasonable discourse. 
Ask any farmer how they feel about Monsanto. They'll say that Monsanto is a godsend. People love to hate on GMOs, and somewhere along the line that became hate on Monsanto
HR 933, Section 735
[deleted]
Have they studied the long-term effects of exposure to GM crops over generations? Have the potential effects of GMOs getting loose in an ecosystem been studied? Have there been studies on how to deal with the problems of monoculture GMO crops? Do we know what happens after a few thousand generations of a particular organism? 

These may seem like nitpicks but when you're dealing with the global food supply people have a right to be picky.

Another argument I would make is the commodificaton of the ability to grow food. Seeds for GMO crops are treated as products that are the sole patent property of their developing company. What worries me is seeing a copyright feeding frenzy akin to what we see now with media and companies that sell seeds having the power to influence and control the market even more than they do now as they are the sole suppliers of "legal" seeds.
Yeah they just gotta look across the pond at the US, privatized healthcare ooo yeah working out so fucking great for us.

They also have to put all these pallets of bottled water on trucks to go to their final destination. I work for a company that shipped well over 25,000 truckloads for Nestle Waters last year, and we have LESS THAN 10% wallet share of their total US / Canada transportation spend. That's a lot of trucks on the road, thus a lot of carbon emissions. 
I just spent $4 USD. Can I have my 1.78 million liters/litres of water now? Its okay if you round down a bit, I'll cover the transaction costs and what not.

monitizing air would be great. why is the air shit in japan? because no one owns it and china can pollute it without consequence. if air had property rights, a socially optimal solution would be achieved (coase theorem).
I normally look at the packaging, if it says Nestl√© anywhere i put it back on the shelf and find an alternative.
Oh wow. I skipped over that part and went to look at the brands. 
What is that?
Is that anything like a Cleveland Steamer?
What did people feed their kids before "baby food" existed? Somehow we survived all that time without it.
Baby food is a nonsense product, as much as bottled water. Babies eat smushed whatever you have around.
Use the app buycott
Thank you!
Awesome-thanks!
Meh, we rent so we don't have to worry about the filters and the upkeep. Our landlords have gone through a few though and have purchased top of the line stuff but our water still sucks. So if we just have to pau about $15 a month extra to get good water it isn't a loss. We aren't staying here forever so for right now it works
Doesn't mean it tastes good. Not everyone gets to drink from a pristine watershed. Some of get scrubbed water that tastes of chlorine and who knows what else. I drink tap water because I need it, and drink it as quickly as possible or reeeeally cold, so I can't taste it. 
[deleted]
As /u/nidrach was downvoted for saying, the hundreds of liters per day does not include water used for producing stuff we use of buy. That is just what we use in our home. If your home has a water meter, you can check this easily. Write down the reading now, do so again in a week, subtract the two numbers, divide by the number of people in the house and by 7 days. You will be surprised about just how much water you use.

If you include water used to produce the stuff you buy, you end up at thousands of liters per day.
I like bottled water. Everybody I know likes bottled water.
>voting generally doesn't mean shit.

This is exactly the attitude that causes the problem in the first place. It's defeatist. I hope Obama goes through with mandatory voting.
I'll agree with the sentiment, but in implementation things tend to get very messy and inefficient.

Prices communicate the degree of scarcity, encourage proportional consumption, and incentivize increasing the supply.  When the prices get manipulated, you end up with over-consumption by consumers, while inventors spend their time on more lucrative, even if far less important, areas.

Again, it's doable to a degree.  But beyond a certain point, nobody has gotten it right, and a lot of countries over the last 100 years suffered the consequences.  For recent examples, ask someone about the gas lines in the 70's, or go to Venezuela and try to buy some toilette paper.
They also make Tombstone, DiGiorno, Jack's and CPK frozen pizza's. There are a lot of brands that aren't on that graphic. Beyond that, they have a food service division so you're buying their food at lots of restaurants, including the chains: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, The Capital Grille, Eddie V's, and Yard House. 
You're buying shitty pet food if you're buying any of those brands.
Use the app buycott
they have their fingers in EVERYTHING.  You almost have to buy generic brand everything and even then you don't know what's been manufactured by them and purchased by whatever store to sell under the store name/generic label.
>it's warped the debate beyond reasonable discourse

Precisely :( I've had exactly one conversation ever with an anti-GMO person who was actually interested in discussion. I would not be surprised if there were as many people blindly praising GMOs without any research. The whole topic is just so charged that I just don't know how to even communicate about it.
What's stupid about toxins? You can introduce foreign toxins into plants with gmo. Some played arround with it already. Simple idea was letting the plants produce its pesticide itself.

The issue was whether you can keep concentration stable as overdose could be potentially be harmfull not only to insects. 
I'm pretty sure that they don't go after people who unknowingly replant their seeds. They only do it against people with intent. Like, say you discover Monsanto's crop in your fields one day and you keep it for yourself, replanting it over and over without their permission while *knowing* that. Then they'd sue you, and that's why they win. It's their crop, technically speaking and legally speaking. If you didn't know (and honestly, most modern farmers aren't so blind to these differences) then it'd be a different story.
>Have they studied the long-term effects of exposure to GM crops over generations?

The crops have been studied for as long as they were available - [they were only first introduced into animal feed in 1996](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/comprehensive-study-100-billion-animals-finds-gmos-safe-livestock), so it's tough to study beyond the reach of data.  

>over generations

I'm not sure why this is significant, as it's not like rogue genes jump from GM crops into the humans or other animals that consume them...

[Here's a paper that explicitly states that there are no concerns for potential gene transfer.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1364539/)

>Have the potential effects of GMOs getting loose in an ecosystem been studied?

This is a very valid concern, yes - and it's true, there is always gene flow between crops and the natural environment!  However, keep in mind that such gene flow occurs in all crops, GM or non - there are no "natural" corn plants in the wild that will suddenly sprout new herbicide resistance.  And indeed, the whole point of many traits that are inserted into GM crops, such as herbicide resistance, *confer no benefit unless that plant is being doused with herbicide.*  There's no evolutionary incentive for these genes to be kept in wild species.

[An article on the topic, noting that this does happen - but also that the traits tend to die out quickly if they're not being constantly re-introduced into the environment.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetically-modified-crop/)

>Have there been studies on how to deal with the problems of monoculture GMO crops?

Ah, you mean different from the monocultures of conventional, non-GM crops?  

In fact, the focus of crop breeding, both GM and conventional, is to make more efficient plants, to reduce the effects of monoculture.  Again, this is something that is a whole different issue than the GM issue.

>Do we know what happens after a few thousand generations of a particular organism?

See the "commodity" answer, below.

>Seeds for GMO crops are treated as products that are the sole patent property of their developing company. What worries me is seeing a copyright feeding frenzy akin to what we see now with media and companies that sell seeds having the power to influence and control the market even more than they do now as they are the sole suppliers of "legal" seeds.

This has been happening for close to a hundred years, now, long before the discovery of GM crops.  Science lesson time!

If crops are self-bred for many generations, they become "inbred" lines, which means that there is very little to no variation in that strain of plant.  Inbred lines are useful for studying genes, as there's no need to worry about a second, different gene copy screwing up an experiment.

When two inbred lines are crossed, they create hybrids - the offspring plants have one copy of each parent's set of "pure" genes!  

This results in something called "hybrid vigor," where that very first hybrid generation from an dual-inbred cross produces even more yield than either parent did.

However, this hybrid vigor only persists for the first generation, and then rapidly fades in subsequent generations - until the yield has fallen not just below that first generation's level, but even below the level of the pure parents.  

For this reason, ever since hybrid vigor was discovered back in the early 1900s [(in fact, here's an article talking about the first company to take advantage of selling hybrid vigor seeds - in 1926)](http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/crops_03.html), most farmers re-buy seed every year.  Indeed, the increase in yield from this hybrid vigor effect earns the farmer more money than the added cost of re-buying seed.  

So the whole idea of "you can't replant GM seeds" is a bit of a straw man argument - **even with conventional crops, farmers don't replant seeds.**

Tied to this, by the way, is the answer to your above question about after a thousand generations.  Because only first-generation crosses are used, the plants never make it to a thousand generations - or even more than one generation.

Again, it's not just GM crops that are treated as commodities.  Just about all plants, even conventional crops, are highly protected and guarded zealously by the companies that bred them for their specific traits.  This is a problem of the whole current crop system, but it's really not tied to GM crops.

I mean no offense by any of these answers, and I'm not aiming to provoke any argument!  I study genetics and work at a huge agricultural research university, so talking about this is one of my passions.  If anything above doesn't seem clear, let me know and I'll try to provide more detail. 
We already have fast water.  It comes from a faucet. 
I guess that sort of makes sense, because telecom companies charge a huge premium for infrastructure that is often heavily subsidized by the taxpayer (when the telecoms don't just pocket taxpayer money without anything being built).
The owner of a company's name does not have to go on the label.
you might want to find it out your self......
somehow related
No one is trying to knock agriculture, but some crops use less water than others. The suggestion is to raise the price to cut out some of the crops that maybe shouldnt be grown in the water situation.
Because recently they've all started growing much more water logging crops like almonds for higher prices. We need them to switch back because we can't feed their trees right now. 
Where I live the tap water doesn't taste right. My city is notorious for dirty ass tap water. It made mr sick when i first moved here. I drink from gallon bottles from the grocery store now. But where I lived before, like two miles away ironically, the tap water tastes great. 
Corn filled crap. 
Generics usually are made by the same companies that produce similar products. I.e., if you buy a generic can of soup, chances are it was made by Campbells or Progresso. It's made from the stuff that's different in consistency/flavor than the rest of the name brand line.


Well GMO is sort of like antibacterials. There's no need to fear it, and it can be utilized in a manner that is immensely beneficial. But there is a need for regulation and caution, because wanton use of it can lead to consequences (bacterial resistance). For GMO, you could potentially create crops that are pest resistant without pesticides, that are completely safe and healthy for human consumption. But overuse might lead to extinction of insects that are vital for other animals on the food chain, or one pest becoming more prominent and wiping out crops, etc. 
I'm totally with you guys.
So what you're saying is that people who are happy with their water bill now should have their water pressure limited to a steady trickle and those who need more water can buy an upgraded plan for things like showers, more flushes per hour or high dollar lawn watering solutions?
Yeah, but for only 29.99 a month Nestle will install a pneumatic tube that will deliver a bottle of water to your house at the push of a button and only charge you 3.99 at the end of the month per bottle, prices varying based on regional demand.
For now... that's not going to be the case in CA in a year...
Looking at the producer label for "Nestle" is an OK place to start though.
No good can come from that statement, but I will venture forth anyway.

Edit: I was right
For sure. My company helps the Almond Board of California export almonds to China.

**I fucking hate that.** Almonds use lots of water, and we're just selling them. It's consuming huge water resources for the private profit of a few. I hope they fail somehow.
It's going to raise the cost of meat FAR more than it will raise the price of produce.

Cause, you know, animals eat plants...
[deleted]
It is sad that your cities water supply is fucked, even though for the most part your water tastes bad due to the delivery system. The moral of the story is that we should all be paying more attention to the diminishing quality of water on a global scale.

Turns out we need water to live and should quit dumping poison in it. Who would have thought?
buy a filter and keep jugs in the fridge, problem solved.
Yep. And I prefer spring to just purified, which is just bottled from some city's tap.
Most likely that water is from the tap
I agree 100%. We need to study it; how to use it safely and most effectively.
Don't forget: Expect the basin/shower/toilet makers to pay a levy for customers to use their service.
Also keep an eye out for "distributed by" or "imported from" recognizable Nestle companies.
But those are some good eating! 
Ah, but from a better city's tap water.  
Nestle can go straight to hell. They have drained my region (Maine) so throughly that even 600' wells are going dry, and all anyone is pulling up anymore is undrinkable sulfur and iron. They didn't stop pumping full tilt during our drought this past year, even when we had to bring carloads of bottled water (Nestle brands, of course, nothing else is sold) just to cook and flush our toilets.

Oh, and now we're feeling micro-quakes almost every day, and the theory is that they're draining the aquifers so fast, they aren't settling naturally.

I hate them more than I thought I could ever hate a company. Fuck Nestle. 
Hardball in this case jamming them with ~~legal fees~~ court proceedings until the town is too broke to fight. You know, justice. 
The article says that they only pay $200.00 per year to draw as much water as they like at 250Gpm out of a well, and that they're asking for 400Gpm now. Why is that even allowed? They're going to devalue every home with well water once they pump the aquifer dry.
how hard would it be to launch a nestle boycott?
Nestle also poisoned children in Africa after they grouped up and refused to work until they got paid more. Fuck Nestle. 
I do not knowingly buy Nestle products  and most people should stop buying Nestle products. They are a vile corporation starting with their CEO who sated that everyone should have to buy water.

Corporations like this only respond to income reductions. Once they start losing income, they start paying attention. Unfortunately their products are included in other products. When I see the Nestle name or brand in any form on a product, that product goes back on the shelf.
In Michigan they've finally been, if not stopped, at least delayed in getting an absurd amount of water for like pennies on the dollar. Nestle is the epitome of the terrible corporations we hear so much about. 
strange someone had recently informed me that Nestle believes water should not be a human right. Looks like they were not lying
Nestle Waters & Power.
Fuck Nestle, despicable company
Good thing I didn't go work for them when I had the chance.
Dammit Hot Pockets and Drumsticks. I'm almost there
How in the hell do you turn a water and candy company into Evilcorp. 
Come to Wisconsin nicely. You can get away with anything in our state
Upvoting this story for visibility.  It's time for cases like this to get into court.  According to the article, the state is already under pressure to put a stop to this, as they should be considering the shitshow going on in Flint.
Pathetic lawyers who have sold their souls.
When will morals for mankind be brought against businesses?

Oh right their greed will never be ridden. Because the ones that would fix it are just as greedy. 

Good bye earth. 


>Nestle pays only a nominal $200 annual paperwork fee for the millions of gallons it extracts for bottling and sale around the country each year.

That's just shameful. Public resource -> private profit.
I wouldnt be opposed to the decision makers and lawyers over at nestle being hung in the streets. Complete cunts who use the law to get away with their evil
Heads on a spike.  It's time to start getting serious with these assholes.
Yet it is illegal for me to collect rainwater. Yay!
People are going to start getting violent with these cunts. 
Nestle (Arrowhead Water) has been raping Palm Springs and surrounding communities as well, for years, thanks to an allegedly complicit local official.
Nestle water tastes like rusty buttholes anyways.
Lawyers do what they're supposed to do. 
Well, the corporations are more powerful than the government, now. I guess we lose?
I don't think any town in Michigan should be fighting against clean drinking water.
should probably hate your government officials who keep allowing them to do that shit too.
Why don't you just destroy their wells?  
So I guess nestle is the only water brand in the country getting water from springs. Where else does spring water come from?
Why on earth is this shit even legal? It is actually fucking obscene that there aren't laws in place that would prevent this from happening  
Nestl√© kills babies for profit. 

No, that's not a joke. 
[deleted]
That town should let them go through with it, then declare eminent domain and forcibly take Nestle's property away from them, lmao.
Just like scientology!
The town should do a gofundme to cover the fees.
That's freedom.
Good thing most towns and cities already budget for a city attorney/staff but I'm sure other case loads get pushed behind. 
You mean making sure towns know they aren't above the law? And where did you even get any idea of the town's legal budget? Did you just make that up?
My somewhat informed guess: Laws regarding water use in water-rich states like MI were written decades ago when it never occurred to anyone that some huge company would slurp up every drop in sight for personal profit. Company moves in, provides a few jobs and campaign donations, its like a tick buried in so deep you can get it out. Plus, the harm it causes to each michigan citizen individually is very small, and the benefit to the company is huge, so there's no natural opposition coalition.
In MI you don't own the resources under your property? 
Who cares? Is there a drought in michigan I haven't heard about? It is my understanding that they extract the water themselves and pay taxes (probably not that much, but still). Are they bringing the water off planet or something? I'm more worried about the plastic bottles.
Nestle is one of the AAA corps, up there with Apple and Google, in the rankings of Extraterritorial Corps.  Hard for us wage slaves to boycott them, Chummer. Best we can do is pool together to hire some Runners to hit 'em where it hurts.

It can be pretty hard to dodge them in the grocery store/pharmacy but it *is* doable. 
Print out news articles and slip them between bottles so people who drink it will see when they pick up a bottle. If you aren't part of a conscientious enough group of people who spead the articles on social media, you probably will never know about it. I never would have known about this problem without the friends I have and reddit etc. Education is a great tool to use. 
really fucking hard. i've been trying myself. but nestle is a massive fucking corporation. they have their grubby hands in fucking everything. seasonings, food, all kinds of bottling, i mean seriously if you buy any kind of drink that's in a plastic bottle there's like a 75% chance nestle is involved somehow. 

it gets to near impossible if you want to boycott companies that get supplies from nestle. it's a shitload of work really.
I already do so. 
Link? Wow if true how have these guys not been brought up on charges?
That is unfathomable, it's hard to believe they could do that. On the other hand they are the same company that was sells [tap water from Sacramento California](http://www.mintpressnews.com/nestle-continues-stealing-worlds-water-during-drought/203544/) and doesn't blink an eye continuing to pump water during a drought. 

From the article:
"Nestl√© pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground ‚Äì the same rate as an average residential water user."

Think about that, they pump 470 gallons of water for 65 cents and then fill 3130 20 ounce bottles and sell them to us for roughly $2.00 a bottle. That's brings them in $6259.35 for every $0.65 they spend. They were pumping 80 Million gallons a year. That brings in over a billion from that one plant that was RUNNING DURING A DROUGHT. 

Final note, their CEO is the same guy that believes [water is not a human right](http://collectivelyconscious.net/articles/nestle-ceo-water-is-not-a-human-right-should-be-privatized/) and access to it should be controlled. 

Final final note: Fuck Nestle
Lol, no they didn't, thetre not responsible for every thing a contractor/employee does, thats like saying Coca cola was driving under the influence and killed some people
You mean a company, that isn't Nestle, that is in Nestle's supply chain. 
In the seventies some Nestle baby formula was banned in the US for high lead content. Did they throw it out? No, the sent it to Africa where there were few food safety standards and the people didn't know any better. The kicker? They gave out six-week supplies for free or deeply discounted, then you had to pay regular price. Six weeks is about the time that, if a woman doesn't nurse, her milk dries up. So those who were gulled into using the formula had to keep paying and paying. Fuck Nestle.
No that figure is Bs you need to educate yourself a bit more
Look, nestle is evil, yes, but that quote was taken entirely out of context.  He said drinking water **is** a human right, but other water was not.
Preacher reference. Solid.

Hot pockets don't count for reasons.

Yeah I dont get why our governments dont fucking fight this. We go on about human rights and bitch at other countries like russia while we let this go on? 
Nestle and other water resellers should be required to pay a tax on water they make a profit from.

Nestle and other water resellers should be required to develop biodegradable packaging or invest in recycling to offset the environmental effects of their product.

Nestle and other water resellers should not be prohibited from taking water. I'm not a fan of Nestle or bottled water. But when you look at the numbers you'll see they really aren't taking a substantial amount of water. The amount they use is miniscule compared to agriculture and industries. When a water shortage occurs, the bottlers are hardly to blame.

i think you underestimate how much water nestle bottles.

this is just a list of their main brands for water:

Nestl√© PURE LIFE, Nestl√© Aquarel, Perrier, Evian, Montclair, Vittel, Contrex,
S. Pellegrino, Acqua Panna, Levissima, Vera, Viladrau, Arrowhead, Poland Spring,
Santa Maria, La Vie, Deer Park, Al Manhal, Ozarka, Hepar, Aberfoyle, Gerber, Gerber Graduates.

that doesn't include their minor brands for water.

now think back to your local grocery store, how many of those brands are they carrying. then consider all of the grocery stores across north america, and europe, and asia, how many are they carrying. we can assume they're not going to send water bottled in north america to europe (though some of it is sent to asia though, most notably to china).

nestle alone might not be enough to drain aquifers, but you have to remember they're draining on top of regular use by people living in the area and industries. it's all a matter of balance.
Nestle cracked my cylinder head :(
[deleted]
Then Nestle appeals the taking, and we're back to /u/ld43233's point.
Ya then nestle can get their money from a bunch of do gooders instead
of the town


The state of Michigan spends about $96 million a year on it's attorney general and every branch of the lawyer tree beneath them. I assume a city with 2000 people has less spending power than that allocated for legal fees. That $96 million is about 0.006% of Nestle's yearly net profit of $14 Billion. Should they *really* want that area instead of say, tapping the great lakes like a blue pony keg. 
>Who cares? Is there a drought in michigan I haven't heard about?

Not yet because Nestle hasn't extracted all the water yet.

>It is my understanding that they extract the water themselves and pay taxes (probably not that much, but still).

That's not what the article said. It's a $200/year flat fee for all the water they can extract from a single well, at 250gpm. They are asking to be allowed to increase it to 400gpm.

>Are they bringing the water off planet or something?

No, they're transferring the water that other well owners would be able to drink into bottles that they sell.
There are wells in the area which are no longer providing usable water to the owners. The $200/year fee doesn't come close to the impact that draining the area of water has on the rest of the population. Plus, by transporting the water out-of-area rather than the water being used locally, it's permanently impacting the ability of the groundwater to fully replenish itself by leaving areas underground which were stable when full now empty and prone to shifting.

The long term damage this can do is catastrophic.
Pretty sure nestle's CEO is a dragon. 
Take a look at this:
[Image](http://i.imgur.com/XRKeQ1g.jpg)
Shadowrun ftw!
Or we could Lynch their board members in the streets.
those are only their major brands. they have minor brands that cover a shitload more stuff. then there are non related companies that purchase stuff from nestle, or nestle's supply chain. boycotting nestle is really hard. you can boycott their main brands which is probably the most effective for time/effort vs financial impact. since the minor brands and other stuff nets them less profit i imagine.
It's not very hard. I only had to actively avoid it for a month or so before I had the brands memorized and I don't even think about it anymore. 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just Google "Nestle child labor." They go to court and pay the fine and continue to use child labor. It's cheaper to just pay fines than elevate people out of poverty with fair pay. I never buy any of their products anymore.

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/01/nestle-slavery-thailand-fighting-child-labour-lawsuit-ivory-coast
Pepsi did the same thing in [Atlanta](http://www.creativeloafing.com/news/article/13026244/tap-water-wears-a-bow-tie-when-its-put-in-a-bottle-and-sold). WTF
well i guess i kind of agree with him. access to water should be controlled... controlled so that his fucking ass can't have any. fuck nestle.
They are $2 at the store. The store get them from a distributor at about 0.75. And the distribution company get them from nestle at about 0.50 a bottle. 
> hat's brings them in $6259.35 for every $0.65 they spend

because it costs nothing to build facilities, bottle it, labour, and deliver the product? I mean it's just like $6000 in total 100% profit to the CEOs bank account right?

They're a shit company but don't try to make an equally shit argument against them. 

Except Nestle strategically chooses these "contractors" because they are the cheapest. Nestle builds the infrastructure for these "contractors" so it's basically like the Catholic Church blaming a cardinal for molesting even though the Catholic Church appointed the Cardinal. I have no idea why you are sticking up for such an evil business. 
Yes, they are entirely responsible for what their contractor does.
It's like how Nike builds the sweat shop but starts a new company to run it so it's not tied to the Nike name even though they are putting the logo on. Why are you sticking up for child labor? Disgusting.  
What other water is there?
Tank Girl reference.
> Yeah I dont get why our governments dont fucking fight this.

Money, money, money.. 
[Here](http://bangordailynews.com/2017/04/28/business/the-poland-spring-water-controversy-explained/] is an article I found:

>Could Poland Spring deplete Maine‚Äôs groundwater?

>No. Each year, 25 trillion gallons of rain fall on the state. Ten to 20 percent of that enormous amount makes its way underground, replenishing Maine‚Äôs aquifers, according to Ryan Gordon, a hydrologist with the Maine Geological Survey.

Ten percent of that would come out to 2.5 trillions gallons. How much does Nestle use?

>Last year, Poland Spring bottled around 900 million gallons of water

So,  2,500,000,000,000 - 900,000,000 = 2.4991 **trillion gallons** inflow into the aquifiers, worst case and after nestle pumped its water.

I'm not that alarmed yet.


I also live in Maine, and my mom lives in fucking Poland (Poland, you know, where Poland Spring is bottled).  NONE of this is happening.  She, her neighbors, and everyone she works with has had no issues with their well, and "micro quakes"?  Give me a goddamn break.
The fees go to the court, and as long as in the long run Nestle can't drain a small town for their own profit .. or *GASP* pay a fair price for the water they're taking?..  They're charging 1-2$ for each 20oz bottle, but paying tens of dollars a year for the water?????? Nah, pay the town what they deserve and the fighting probably stops.
>Not yet because Nestle hasn't extracted all the water yet.

And when will that be? Is it... never? [I found this story](http://bangordailynews.com/2017/04/28/business/the-poland-spring-water-controversy-explained/) after another user claimed that Nestle was pumping maine dry, and it turns out that 2.5 trillion gallons flow into Maines aquifiers yearly (at least, it might be twice that), and that Nestle takes 900 million gallons of water, leaving Maine with at least 2,4991 trillion gallons yearly inflow.

Do you have the numbers for Michigan?

>That's not what the article said. It's a $200/year flat fee for all the water they can extract from a single well, at 250gpm. They are asking to be allowed to increase it to 400gpm.

Are you serious? They pay taxes on the water they sell.

>No, they're transferring the water that other well owners would be able to drink into bottles that they sell.

But the well owners can drink the other water that is there. Not like anyone can distinguish between individual molecules.

Btw., droughmonitor says that there is no drought in Michigan. It isn't even "a bit dry".
Makes sense. Sadly Dunkelzan is dead, so we can't ask him.
More like a Bond villain.
Shadowrun style
hey, look at that, I'm already boycotting them. yay

The food brands they own are all garbage food. Imagine how healthy everyone will be a few months into the boycott. Double win!
How can a&w be owned by both pepsi and kraft?
S'what I'm saying, chummer.
Funny how almost every company is dependent on sugar or flour.
I buy nothing on that list. Gee, that was easy.

Everything they make, another company makes instead. 
Wow, I am unintentually boycotting Nestle. TIL.
Goddamn their Kit Kat is tasty as hell. Literally the only Nestle product I use. Fuck their coffee, it's pure crap. 
Wow what pieces of shit. the law really is an ass
Same here.  It may not be a big boycott, but they want to suck out all of my state's water.  So none of my money for them!
Coke did the same thing in [India](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/mar/19/business.india1)
Always the pedants completely missing the point.
Changes nothing I said, and yeah good example that shows why you are wrong, the church isn't raping people, or do schools molest children? 

It's not an evil business, come on get a grip
If Nestle didn't start these supply chain shops then your analogy doesn't really hold. Nice emotional appeal though, that should reduce the need for basic logic
Every other use of water that isn't drinking?  Like watering your lawn.
Serious question, are other companies also drilling for water there? And what's happens to the other 80-90%?
I live in maine and my dug well dried up last summer. It's not deep though and noone else i knew dried up. 
Nestle does this shit in BC too. $2.25 per MILLION liters pumped. What a fucking bunch of cocksuckers.

I guess I should thank Nestle as this is slightly less evil ta=han their old tactic in Africa where they gave away free infant milk formula to new mothers. Just enough so their milk would ry up and they'd be forced to buy it from they.

Corporate Cockroaches.
>And when will that be? Is it... never? [...] Do you have the numbers for Michigan?

I do not, but given the near-zero cost of the water there, they have an incentive to draw out as much as they are allowed to, and they keep trying to be allowed to draw out more. I don't know how their interest in water compares to the amount available or its capacity to regenerate.

>Are you serious? They pay taxes on the water they sell.

Sure, they pay taxes on the taxable income they get from selling the bottled water. They pay $200/year for as much water as they can pump at 250gpm. It's practically free for them.

>But the well owners can drink the other water that is there. Not like anyone can distinguish between individual molecules.

Now you're just being snarky. Nestle will do well if they reduce people's access to well water, and not much is in the way of this goal.

>Btw., droughmonitor says that there is no drought in Michigan. It isn't even "a bit dry".

Cool. Let's hope that the well water lasts for a few more years, then.
Wait, Dunkelzen is dead? I've been away for far too long.
Pour qua pas les deux?
We stopped getting anything from a box and quality of life improved massively, as did taste and my decreasing gut.
Presumably Dr. Pepper Snapple owns the rights to A&W root beer sold in stores. Yum! owns the chain of restaurants. Except as far as I know Yum! sold A&W restaurants in 2011.
Pepsi owns A and kraft owns W. You wouldn't buy A rootbeer now would ya? Nor would you buy a W hotdog.. They figured this out in the late 40's and formed a partnership. Work together and whalla, junk food superpower!
Their grouped based off from related products. So Kraft owns the A&W beverage (hence why it's listed with Snapple, Dr. Pepper, Crush, etc) and Pepsico owns the fast food chain (hence why it's listed with KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut & Mario's; under the "Yum" brand.) 

That being A&W also still has a handful of independent restaurants that are still somewhat under the Kraft brand. and as u/happyscrappy said, Pepsico/Yum sold off A&W to A Great American Brand, LLC in 2011. And to complicate things more, the Canadian chain of A&Ws is owned by their own company (used to be under Unilever)
the law is only ass for us regular people and poor people. the law kicks fucking ass if you're mega rich, or a mega corporation.
If you can't make your point without using that kind of idiotic logic then what is your point? Maybe if people actually said something concise and focused rather than talking out of their ass for emotional appeals people could focus on the actual topic rather than having to call them out for their nonsense
Lol knowingly uses child labor to get it's product = not a bad company. So North Korea is a good country, but the people operating it are bad? Again the depth of you trying to stick up for Nestle is very odd, it's almost like you have an agenda to promote? 
Nestle did start it. During the 1800's the Swiss had holdings in others empires. They started controlling the production then as capitalism grew, Nestle exploited all the colonised world creating worker slave situations. They've undermined the locals wishes and ruthlessly killed opposition. Look at South American water rights and how many people had to die before Nestle gave up. They started it. Just because they don't run the bosses doesn't mean they don't manipulate the markets and governments to retain their cheap resources and labor. You're a heartless bastard trying to clean up after they were attacked. Given the votes, I'd say the majority of people agree with me and not you. Nestle = exploitation Kings and are a terrible business. I really hope you're getting something out of this...
>Bath water? Better drain that shit back into the cistern when you're done!  
It's called conservation..  

- Nestle, probably.
According to the article:

>In 2010, 36 billion gallons of water were extracted from Maine for human use. That included the 768 million gallons pumped out by bottled water companies, Gordon said.

But that was 7 years ago. 

I assume there are others, but it probably isn't cool to shit on them.

Don't get me wrong, I don't like Nestle. But I refuse to like them less because they sell bottled water. If anything, let's talk about packaging.

>And what's happens to the other 80-90%?

10-20% make it into the aquifier, the rest is probably runoff or seeps into the ground without every making it into the aquifier, no idea where it goes. Also, puddles.
Much of the remainder is used for irrigation. http://www.lenntech.com/water-food-agriculture.htm


>I do not


Sorry, but don't you think you should have the numbers when you make those claims?

>They pay $200/year for as much water as they can pump at 250gpm. It's practically free for them.

And? If you bill them more they will close down the factory, and you get no taxes and no jobs. And more expensive bottled water. But you also have water in the ground, which is reassuring but not very useful.

>Now you're just being snarky.

I might be ;)

>Nestle will do well if they reduce people's access to well water, and not much is in the way of this goal.

But is that actually happening?

>Cool. Let's hope that the well water lasts for a few more years, then.

Well, its Michigan. I would have thought there is a lot of water there. It's basically a peninsula.

[deleted]
The point of the post was that Nestle are raiding a nationally scarce resource (for nearly free) and are squealing when the authority responsible for that scarce resource does its job by carefully regulating access.

The second point in the thread was that Nestle are already making a huge profit as the major part of the supply chain, as the resource is nearly free, and bottled water is extraordinarily expensive, and understandingly want to extend that profit as far as they can.

Your comment regarding capital cost and supply chain investment was at best, pointless, tangential and diversionary to the overall topic, and was made purely because you're a damn pedant.

Is that better?
No such thing as an evil business, only people are evil, that's what you don't seem to understand, yeah again you proved yourself wrong with your own example,

Lol yeah the agenda is common sense, I can see you're pretty opposed to it though
>Sorry, but don't you think you should have the numbers when you make those claims?

Well, Nestle wants as much water as they can get, since it's their business to sell water. If allowed, they will drain it all dry in the pursuit of profit. _If_ nature exceeds their capacity for greed, then Michigan is safe from them.

>And? If you bill them more they will close down the factory

If you bill them more than _$200 a year for unlimited water_ they will close down the factory? First of all, that's insane. Second, there are far worse things than a factory closing down, like being unable to get water from your faucet.

>>Nestle will do well if they reduce people's access to well water, and not much is in the way of this goal.

>But is that actually happening?

Not so far, but they have an incentive to do it and no incentive not to do it. Therefore, it will happen.

>Well, its Michigan. I would have thought there is a lot of water there. It's basically a peninsula.

Not all water becomes well water, but let's hope there's enough.
it's win win either way. if you have a conscience you can be treated fairly by the law. cops won't try to frame you for shit cause they know you'll bury them with money or investigators to prove they framed you. or if dickheads try to bury you in lawsuits to bankrupt you they can't. you can fight back and win and then counter sue them for court costs. if you were poor you'd have no chance.

if you don't have a conscience well... then you have shit like nestle and oil corporations.
Yes and the point of my post was that point is lost because of the need of the poster to talk out of their ass.  

You can't take some kind of moral high road shit posting like that. 
That's why your being down voted. Nestle is an evil company and a great example of the evils and destruction from empirical capitalism leading to modern cronie capitalism. Nestle would be nothing without exploitation, manipulation, and undermining democracy. People actually die so Nestle can make money and Nestle doesn't give one shit. 
>Well, Nestle wants as much water as they can get, since it's their business to sell water.

No, they want 400 gallons per minute.

>If allowed, they will drain it all dry in the pursuit of profit.

I doubt that they could possbly do that, even if they devoted all their capital to doing it.

>If you bill them more than $200 a year for unlimited water they will close down the factory? 

Depends on the amount. 200 per year? They don't close down. 1 trillion a year? They close down. How much do you want them to pay?

>Second, there are far worse things than a factory closing down, like being unable to get water from your faucet.

We still haven't established that this is even a *remote* possibility.

>Not so far, but they have an incentive to do it and no incentive not to do it. Therefore, it will happen.

Your logic is all kinds of faulty here.



Lol downvoted, no pal Nestle is a company that sells a product and people choose to buy, no one cares about some mistreatment someone associated to the company suffers, if they did people wouldn't buy the products and the company would cease to exist, it is democracy in action
>No, they want 400 gallons per minute.

No, their latest incremental request is 400gpm. There's no reason to expect them to stop there.

>I doubt that they could possbly do that, even if they devoted all their capital to doing it.

It depends on the size of their worldwide market, doesn't it?

>Depends on the amount. 200 per year? They don't close down. 1 trillion a year? They close down. How much do you want them to pay?

A cost that removes the incentive to pump as much as they want to. Economically, the environment is an externality to them, so they have no other reason to not ruin the lives of others.

If they get their wish to draw at 400gpm, they could pull out 210,240,000 gallons annually. That retails for $1,919,491,200. A few hundred million dollars a year should be a fair cost, don't you think?

>We still haven't established that this is even a remote possibility.

You're right. I don't have the necessary 3D simulations of the details of the aquifer to know that pulling unlimited water out of it might possibly cause residential wells to run dry. You'll find that most of the experts in the field are cautious about certainty when underground water is concerned. They can't tell you definitively what will and won't happen, either, nor can they give you a cutoff amount of what would be too much water to drain.

>Your logic is all kinds of faulty here.

Nope. It's actually so simple you probably missed it. I'll rephrase:

Company want money. Company can get money. Nobody stop company get money. Now company have money.
No one can enter the market to compete. Then corporate protections would save them. They are too big for democracy to function. They can kill people and work people to death, and no one can do shit. You're like fuck people because money. 
Lol why complain. About Nestle if its the gov. That gives them that power/protection? That's the part that is actually supposed to be accountable to the people and represent them. And no all people have to do is stop buying Nestle products.

As a resident of the Great Lakes State, this is horrible news. Nestle already tried, and lost, to privatize  our water. I know they'll be back. The documentary [Blue Gold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Gold:_World_Water_Wars) covers it well.
This shouldn't be allowed.
They are at the top of the EVIL corporations list.
I look forward to the day when Brabeck-Letmathe is dragged from his home in his nightshirt at 3AM by a mob wielding torches and pitchforks.
People, especially Americans, won't do shit if a corporation denies us access to a natural resource. The entire world at this point is slowly waking up and smelling the proverbial coffee. The way to solve the worlds problems is to end major corporate governments
This shouldn't be allowed.
This shouldn't be allowed. 
That's not right.  Corporations shouldn't be able to buy resources required for life. 
Nestl√© are such evil fuckers
How does the government allow this?
Fucking hell not again, I hate how in Canada we allow so many shitty companies buy rights to our natural resources just to be exploited and ruined. 

So many people in the government here believe economic growth is more important than ecology of where they live. 
Nestle does employ a certain amount of Canadians, which I'm sure they used as leverage with the town of Elora and the government for that matter. It wouldn't have mattered how much the town bid, Nestle was taking that well. A lot of companies have been leaving the province due to high energy costs to wages ratio. Needless to say, this "transaction" was going through... Unconditionally. 
ITT: a karma circle jerk about bottled water, while nobody gives a second thought to how much water it takes to support their lifestyle. 

If you think bottled water is the problem, you're not thinking very hard. It's just become the latest cause celebre for the intellectually lazy. Your fucking pumpkin spice latte took 53 gallons to make, your 10 pairs of jeans each took 1800 gallons to make, your pint of beer took 72 gallons, that steak you ate took 2500 gallons, your smart phone took 41,000 gallons to make. And on and on with every fucking thing you eat, drink, own and use.

But nestle is the problem right? Not all the shit you waste, needlessly buy, upgrade to a newer version? None of the luxuries in your life are the problem, no, no, no. It's bottled water, that's what's straining our water supply.

It's definitely not your kitty, or the 29,000 gallons of water it takes to make their food for a year.


This shouldn't be allowed.
This shouldn't be allowed.

this is so wrong. It is ridiculous & maddening. 
My understanding: someone is selling a well.  A township near it wants to buy it to prevent corporate water mining, a water mining company wants it as a backup source.  Township offers best initial contract, mining company finds out about current best offer and trims theirs to match it apparently unknowingly bidding against a township.  Contract is awarded to the mining company with the same offer.  Is there a piece here missing?  Like, who the seller was trying to give this thing to in the first place?
Who was selling it? Was it a Canadian source? Why didn't they just refuse the mega-corporation and sell it to their own counry's town?  
  
Canadians should be asking questions about who's selling out their country.
The absolute fastest way to become #1 target following the collapse of civilization.  Privately own the shit people need to survive. 
This shouldn't be allowed.
This shouldn't be allowed. 
Does Canada not have eminent domain? Couldn't they just force the sale of the well to the town and thus secure the water for their own needs?
In most places west of the Mississippi, water rights are for sale.  I don't know why this surprises so many people.  Farmers, cities, ranchers, oil companies, brokers etc all buy and sell water rights.
They are doing the same thing in Lagos, Nigeria. A city of over 20 million people. Exactly how does one company get away with buying fresh water rights across multiple countries? Does nestle know something we don't? 
Pretty sure Montgomery Burns is the CEO of Nestle
It is insane that any gov't would allow a corporation to do this, let alone in a 1st world country. Did we learn nothing from Fiji?
That's why you don't put things like roads and water sources on the free market. These are things that the government should control for the people. Corporations are there to make money and they will do everything they can to make money.
The township should expropriate (eminent domain) it from Nestle.
And this surprises whom? A giant corporation versus a little town
You people, in this thread, realize that anybody can drill a well, right?  They're not a finite resource.
Fuck you in your fucking face Nestle!
Why doesn't someone assassinate his lineage? What's stopping the good people in the world from stooping to their level for peace and the environment?


This shouldn't be allowed, unless Google or Tesla or Gary Busey wants to do it.

The first two, because it'd like to see what would happen.

The last, because i'd like to see what would happen.
As an American, I have to ask: Why the fuck are we still allowing corporations to shit all over us?  They are little robbing us of the most important component of life, and polluting other sources of that component.

Seriously, why are societies becoming more and more subservient to these cocksuckers?
This seems like a bad direction. Why should a global company only looking to pad their profits be able to deny this town the ability to secure for the long term basic access to water supplies? 

Surely we can't seriously advocate a world where wealthy multinational corporations can swoop in anywhere in the world and privatize access to natural resources just because they have more money? 
Nothing will change until people start killing these corrupt business assholes in droves.
Why not blame the company that sold the water rights?
The world is simply a corrupt selfish cesspool.  If you are profiting from something, all is good.  It you are not, all is bad.

Nothing is going to change.  The powers that be will see to that.  We will get cake and like it.
Well, fuck. Water is a commodity, it shouldn't be bid on like an ebay item.
How the fuck are they still not being stopped? 

Oh right, cause all of us are sitting here jerkin off rather than learning a thing or two as to how to stop such an entity from being so damn evil. 
Isn't fascism great?
Nestle's plan to become the villain in the next Bond movie:

1. Murder more employees than Apple - CHECK

2. Murder executives who want their severance pay - CHECK

3. Murder african babies with nutrient-free milk - DOUBLE CHECK

4. Bulk up chocolate with wood shavings - CHECK

5. Buy up water sources and then re-locate the factory to another state - CHECK

6. Fire employees for going to the police when raped at work - CHECK

7. Threaten the employees above with physical violence in their homes unless they drop lawsuits - CHECK

How long will it be until Nestle finally changes its name to Water and Power?
How long will it be until Nestle finally changes its name to Water and Power?
    Sad, water wars have already started and thus far, in many locales and nations, Corporations are winning.  
If people really want to stop this then they should stop buying so much bottled water.
Where is Trudeau? Where is Wynnne? 
Canada doesn't have eminent domain laws? How does shit like this happen?
Stop buying bottled water. Get a filter. Bring a waterbottle out with you. Leave a jug in the car. Cut them off where it hurts.
When will they be able to privatize oxygen?  How about sunlight?  I'm sure companies are researching its feasibility.  
Corporations are people, money is people in bill and coin form, that's why they put faces on those.

You do not matter.
As long as people buy bottled water, the companies have to get it from somewhere.  this was a well for sale.  someone can always sink a new well a distance aways.
It's almost as though Canada hasn't yet discovered that evil exists in the world.
This better not be allowed.
Man there is so much hate for Nestle on Reddit, I can't wait for everybody to realize that Nestle isn't even the top bottled water producer in the U.S.  *grabs popcorn*
oh well, still buying bottled water...
Oh enough of this shit!

Go look up how much water Nestle uses for bottling - and then look up how much water each of the 1,000 small farms nearby use.  You will see that agriculture uses so much more water it isn't even funny.  We use virtually no water for bottling.  

So, to complain about it is ludicrous.

Also, I live in Canada.  There is absolutely no water shortage anywhere in the country.  Not a single person is going without copious amounts of water (~350 liters per person per day).
The CEO of the company does not believe water is a basic human right. 
It's like the evil corporation in that movie Tank Girl
Don't know much about this, but can't the local governments pass laws forbidding the sale for commercial use, or designating the water source a historic landmark (so they can't really develop it), or rule a microbe an endangered species.  You know, apply some kind of counter skulduggery?  I just feel like there are clear ways to disincentivise the purchase by corporate interests.
Nestle is Swiss, after all.  
Their bottled water sucks too.
As the prophet Bey said ["The same cats that pollute the whole shoreline, then purify and sell it for a $1.25, now the world is drinking it, new world water..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5Bk8FMw9Y)
Technically it's their customers that do all that polluting.
A fellow Michigander!

I always used to joke about how if the world ever went into a worldwide superdrought, Michigan and other parts of the US along with parts of Canada would secede to form the Great Lakes Nation.
State Militia. We kick their asses.
Allowed? This shouldn't be!
Try boycotting them. It's actually hard. 
But not the company who sold them it rather than to the community? Nestle only knew that there were other bidders, but not who they were.
Near the top, not at the the top. People forget Monsanto, etc.
Will there be an email blast or group text beforehand to coordinate? I would like to sign up to be there to drag him out of his bed. Might I suggest the old fashioned tar and feathering?
[removed]
North America doesn't do shit in response to cases like this because it's never really that bad.  but the rest of the world doesn't tolerate it when it's actually bad.  there have been a few "south american water wars" where the public went ape shit over this kind of stuff back in the early 2000's and also the 60's(i kind of forget when the older one happened).  
Neither will Canadians. 
Same bullshit that happened when they won a bid to produce water bottles in Phoenix. 

Drinking water makes up such a small percentage of total water output it's ridiculous. Look at agriculture. 

Not to mention Canada has no shortage of fresh water. This is just another dumb circle jerk. 
The well was already owned by a corporation.
So many people are going to go without drinking water now. 

/s
And that fucking bunny mascot is up to no good I tell you.
"It's not bad because there is something worse"
Whoa whoa whoa back up Nestle executive. Get the sand out of your vagina. 
Here's a good experiment for folks to try. Instead of turning the shower on in the morning, get a bucket and fill it with two gallons of water. Use the first gallon for soaping/shampooing up and the second for rinsing. 

The next day, close the plug on the shower/tub and take a regular shower. Measure the difference. Now multiply that by 365, and you end up realizing how much we waste. 

I learned all of this after living in a house where a pipe burst and we needed to limit water consumption to less than 10 gallons a day. 
> *ITT: a karma circle jerk about bottled water...*

And ***-I-*** think you've gone on a tirade about a global water supply issue rather than a corporate usurpation of a local community's water supply SOLELY because the corporation MIGHT have a use for it in the future.

But you go ahead and hug your trees and stand on Reddit's soapbox to shout about an UTTERLY unrelated issue, because everything is about you - always.

Perhaps you can drag your real-world soapbox to your city's park later and berate the citizens enjoying their weekend for their callous lack of concern... about YOUR favorite topic.


There's a difference between blaming an organized entity like a corporation versus a nebulous entity comprised of million of individual strawmen
Very good point....   can any Canadian comment?   I know some and will try to ask them tomorrow cause I am pretty curious myself.    I know they faced public backlash here in the states for taking water from.drought stricken areas of California.
The Ministry of Environment and climate change (MOECC) is the source that provides the Permits to Take Water. I know from experience that for the municipal gov level when  a well is constructed, he government needs to seek one of the PTTW as well as Drinking Water Permit from the MOECC. So that may apply here, but seeing as they would likely use existing wells they may have a sort of out clauses until their permit expires or if they would like to increase their pumpage volumes. Again I think this is the case for private wells (like Nestle) but not 100% so someone please correct me. 
Nestle knows the same things we do... they are just acting on that knowledge.
It is sold just like other commodities, bid on and sold every second.
That's exactly what a commodity is.  You can bid on commodities like corn, wheat, pork, oil, and others.  The trades take place on a commodities exchange, where thousands of people all buy and sell these all day long.
Found the teenager.
Wynne is out looking for the next thing she can fuck up.
People hate Nestle for a lot more than just their bottled water practices. That's just the icing on the cake 
You, uh, you use the water you put in the bottles?
[removed]
Worse than that, the CEO is the one that signed death warrants for whistleblowers / long term employees who want severance pay.

He doesn't believe unlimited (wasteful) water is a human right. Filling up your pool or watering your garden shouldn't be your right according to him. He's said everybody should have access to enough water to survive each day though. 

Doesn't mean I condone Nestle's business practices though. 
He'll just be one of the first that ends up in a shallow grave when people can't afford water. 
What a piece of shit. 
I don't believe that.  I think he just knows how profitable it can be to be in charge of all water sources and how detrimental it can be to his monopoly to say one of the fundamental building blocks of life is "a basic human right."  These people are evil...not stupid.
It's property.  If water was a right, you could freely exercise it without anyone else's intervention.  I pump about many acre feet per year off my property and I sell it for around $10k a year.  It's not free.

Edit:  Brigaded by idiots who don't know the definition of "right".  The word you are thinking of is "entitlement"
It's not.
It's not, at least not in the state you want it.
If you thought that movie was cool, check out the original comics. The series was created by the guy who went on to do all the art for the band Gorillaz. 
Yes they can.  But in places where this has happened, Nestle has 'accidentally' had major toxic spills rendering the water useless for human consumption.

Then they just pay someone to say they were driving past the river carrying chemical load X, and Accidentally unloaded right into the river source.  Driver takes the money + nominal punishment from the courts. CEO goes free to commit more evil.



They love their 'revenge'.
Making such laws is becoming common practice for towns in Maine, for this very reason.
And the Swiss have STILL never apologized for pretending to be neutral in WW2, and instead selling hundreds of people (in crates) back to the SS and Gestapo for gold.
Not to mention allowing airdrops for German soldiers, building weapon components etc etc.


Yep and poorly managed landfills/garbage barges.
We'd probably re-build and re-man Fort Michilimackinac!
I wish you good luck in your war against the Free Democratic Republic of Trump. 
Wow they own a lot more than I thought.  Trying to avoid Nestle water only led me to drink some of their other brands.  Good to know which others to try to avoid.
but the libertarians said we can get rid of government and just boycott and that solves everything.
It's not hard if you don't buy preboxed stuff. Buy real produce, meats, and grains. Filter your tap water. Find more natural shampoos and soaps. I rarely come across Nestle products anymore and I put minimal effort into my shopping.
[removed]
I did try, they are fucking everywhere. Literally impossible unless you live like a crazy hippy. 
Is it though? I guess it depends on your lifestyle. If you don't eat processed foods, it's not that hard. 
Why doesn't someone make an app? Scan the product and it will tell you whether it belongs to a shitty company?
Better do it quick. As the wealth gap grows ever wider, the elite are not going to be interested in trusting the local police force for their own security. They're going to be hiring guns. Most probably have already.

For children, by children
Necessities of life is a pretty good motivator.  You don't really see any sustained big mass movements unless hunger or fear of imminent death is present. It's why famine is a common precursor to revolutions. Otherwise most people lose attention, everyday life just continues and you have stuff that needs to get done and people to see and bills to pay. 

Problem with this is that it has to get extremely bad before significant portions of the population snap and go for the throat. And  meanwhile the problems get momentum and get harder and more expensive to try and counter in the future. 
I don't really feel like that makes it any better, I'm just saying natural resources that are essential to life should be regulated and not allowed to be owned, no matter how long they've been doing it.
Hey, just bought your house.  You can keep living in it, for a fee.  I can also do whatever I want with it.  No reason to be upset, it's not like you'd be going without shelter.
I already turn off the water in the shower while I soap up. It's only on for getting wet initially and rinsing off. I'm not sure how much water I use but I'd wager it's below average.

Well I dunno if I worded it correctly, or if you are saying that since water is a commodity, you can bid on it, but it's a shitty practice. We all know what Nestle does with their water and it's fucking disgusting. Money shouldn't win over ethics and a dash of common sense.

The problem isn't Nestle, although they are the 800 lb gorilla in the room. It's the demand, for bottled water, itself. I am as guilty as any as grabbing a quick, naturally decomposing plastic bottle of water almost every time I am in a gas station. The more bottled water people purchase, the more privatisation of water will grow. I, personally, am going to make a point to begin carrying water in a reusable container every time I get into my vehicle. May not say the world, but it's a few less per week and that adds up.

No ones boycotting.

I'm not at *all* a crazy hippy and can't find anything on their lists of products that I use or buy. All of the food on here is basically garbage.
[Here's a corporation "family tree" that will show you who owns what.](http://i.imgur.com/D0PBdoX.jpg) It's likely not even up to date, but it's a good indication of who owns everything. Warning, it's a very large image.
Food is essential to life, you don't want corporations to farm?
I think nestle puts water in bottles and sells it to people.  I pump water out of my property and sell it to cattle farmers.  My water district puts water in pipes and sells it.  How is that disgusting?

Yeah if you think selling things is disgusting or wanting to get paid for your work is disgusting, you should overthrow the government.
And now you've given him a great idea so he starts buying up all the rain forests and putting bags over the trees so he can sell you canned oxygen a la spaceballs
I have avoided nestle products for at least 40 years.  When they buy a company that I like, I stop buying that, too.  But, yeah, Genghis Khan liked to put adversaries in an airless room and listen to them pound the walls trying to get out.
That's if you remove the air... You could just leave him in small air proof container until his breathing causes the co2 levels to rise and start causing instinctual panic. 
He doesn't think you shouldn't be able to get it. Just that it [non-essential water] shouldn't be free.
I'm not saying he didn't say that.  He knows it's a basic human right.b. He's not going to say that because it would thwart their efforts to monopolize water supplies then charge exorbitant prices for it.
The very first settlers in the west realized that water was scarce and they immediately set up laws to regulate the ownership and use.  Tragedy of the commons was well known before the us existed.  So it's never been free.

And it can't be.  Nobody wants dirty river water.  Taking that and making drinking water require work.  And since people (and capital) don't work for free, it takes money to pay for the labor and capital to make clean water.  So no, it cannot be common practice to have free water, unless you want swamp water coming out of your shower.

~ so jealous.  I wish I could move back.  Enjoy my beautiful home state!!
Learned the other day friskas cat food is made by Nestle. They own a LOT. 
Lots of great non-Nestle deodorant out there. Google is your friend.
Yup.... DON'T BUY BOTTLED WATER... PERIOD

I filter my water through two different pitcher filters just because I'm weird like that. Get yourself a nice bottle you'll use all the time and maybe a few backup ones. If you filter it and make it something you like drinking like that you will. I understand some places need bottled water because of shitty tap water/pollution/lead/etc., but most don't need to.
And even then, that may not be true. Store-brand things are usually produced by major companies, but just labeled/packaged differently.
Check other companies that they own. That's where they fuck you.
I'm pretty sure I'm in the clear too. I don't eat a lot of pre-packaged foods, and the ones that I do I just check. I switch from Coffee Mate to International Delight because of Nestle.
wow I actually don't buy any of their stuff like ever.  Go me.

Dude, what's ridiculous though is that these companies own like both competitors for some products.  Like.  what.  Fucking P&G owns dawn and cascade
So...a bunch of personal vanity products, candy, junk food and some brands of pet food.  Don't see what the trouble is with boycotting all that, turns out I've been doing it without even trying.
They produce the food so I think that's different, no one produced the water it's a natural resource.

You make a good point though.
I'd definitely prefer they didn't. The worst people in the world controlling food sources is not a good thing. See factory farming 
Well they've had all those shitty controversies concerning water and powder for babies or whatever.

I don't think buying/selling water is a bad idea, only controlling a source of it. It should be available to all imo

Used to be free now of course there's a fee cause it's all about getting that cash...money.
> I don't believe that.

I must have misunderstood... 
I understand and for the most part agree with what you're saying but if drinking water wasn't free and required money and capital our species wouldn't be here. All I'm saying is that if water always goes to the highest bidder, humanity is gonna run into some BIG problems eventually. People aren't gonna sit down and die cause they can't afford water, they're gonna fight for it.
That's what the government is for, last time I checked they used our tax dollars. Honest question, is this new information to you?
Except river water wasn't dirty UNTIL these companies started pumping toxic crap into them upstream.

For MILLIONS of years humans have drunk from rivers without problem, it's only in the past 200-300years we've fucked the river systems up with toxic metals and organic company effluent.
Tell me you moved to NYC cause then we could pretend we swapped lives haha.

Just showing you may want to reword what you said a little.
It allows millions to eat that wouldn't otherwise.
Any more info on this? Asking *for a friend*
I don't think unlimited fresh water should be free. It's a limited resource. I don't necessarily want Nestle to be the ones who control the water, but I also don't think you should be able to fill up a pool for the same rate as you pay for drinking water.
Op said "the CEO doesn't believe water is a basic human right." Then I said no "I don't believe that"...because he knows it's a basic human right, he's just saying that so he can continue his shitty practices.

...so yeah, I guess you must have misunderstood.
Water full of parasites has always been free.  You can get that today for free.  Water that is treated, chlorinated, and delivered to you in a pipe at 50 psi is not free.

>All I'm saying is that if water always goes to the highest bidder, humanity is gonna run into some BIG problems eventually.

I make my living selling and treating water.  There's plenty of water.  It rains all the time.  

A project of mine was to clean up a tributary of the arkansas river that had a spill of sodium hydroxide, which made the stream a pH of like 11.  We built a treatment plant on the side of a mountain, treated it, and it discharges into the Ark and its clean (ish).  It was a cool project because we had no way to get power there, so it was all solar.  And no way to get a bulldozer in there.  The only municipal service is literally a 28.8 modem.  And I made that work.  When the plant discharges water, I get a report of the water quality sent to my phone over an old ass modem.  If it has any problems, I have to drive up to Leadville CO and fix it.  Its been 4 years since I had to go there. 

My point is, we got this.  Water's good, even in the west where its dry as shit.  

>People aren't gonna sit down and die cause they can't afford water, they're gonna fight for it.

Everyone has water.  Calm down.  I live in a desert and I water my grass for 4 hours a week.  I could give that up, and like a dozen more families could use that water to run their houses.  We are not in any danger at all of running out of water.  
It was.  Humans get sick from drinking surface water.  It wasn't until very recently that humans didn't die in droves from waterborne diseases.
I moved to the Philadelphia area.  But I have an ex-uncle named Skip :)
/u/Animal-Crackers did say "basically garbage" so I feel like ready meals aren't exactly a counter example.
That's okay, Stouffer's tastes better anyways.  
a substantial portion of it is garbage food though.  From a financial perspective, it makes little sense to keep brands that lose money, so even boycotting some of their stuff will hurt them.  The problem is getting it to be widespread enough.

Do you think Nestle will keep wonka if wonka suddenly starts hemorrhaging money? 
In the same way that people wouldn't drink if nestle didn't own the water? The world can be fed without three companies producing all the food. It will just be less profitable. But also more sustainable, healthy, and humane. What corporate control of the food source is going to get us is anti bacterial resistant super bugs.

Sure, homo sapiens never would have evolved without Nestle corp filtering water 20,000 years ago. Life on earth couldn't have survived without Nestle removing parasites millennia ago. 


"Calm down", from what? 
Your project was to clean up a river that a company fucked up.

Did humans have to constantly clean this river to make it useable for the past several hundred thousand years?....

>> We are not in any danger at all of running out of water.

You might want to look at the state of california which HAS run out of water in many areas.  Not will, HAS.

All whilst Nestle continues to steal water from rivers illegally, destroying farms and livelihoods, driving towns out of existence.  Hell Nestle has a massive green area outside its HQ as a big fuck-you to America..

Also still illegally taking water it has no rights to and threatening anyone that disagrees:

http://www.ecowatch.com/nestle-bottled-water-drought-2012310851.html





Yeah, it looks like they deal in ready-made/frozen foods(which I don't eat). There's enough alternatives/competitors to everything else they have their hand in that it's pure coincidence that I don't buy or use any of their products.
Heh, Nestle owns them as well.
More and more people are eating that stuff, unfortunately. It's fast and easy, and it tastes "good". I was so glad when Food Network first came on the air because it was encouraging people to cook and had actual cooking instructional shows. Now it's all about where to eat and what process crap to buy, or just more reality tv.
Gotta also remember Nestle has deliberately poisoned rivers in Africa to get 'revenge' when towns and cities won't sell their water sources to them.  Caused the death of hundreds of thousands of babies with nutrient-free milk etc etc. Unredeemable evil that needs to be shut down with prejudice.
You're hysterical.  If you want free water, it's the same water that humans drank 2000 years ago.  It's not clean, but it is free.  If you want to spend zero dollars on water, you can have that for free.  If you want clean water delivered to your house, you have to pay for it.
I was just going to say something similar. We pay companies for treated water that needs to be treated because they ruined them in the first place. It's a trap
It was a train wreck that spilled sodium hydroxide into the river.  What's your remedy?  Ban train wrecks?  Not use chemicals and live a primitive lifestyle?

I don't know what your point is.

Edit:  and drinking from a river is free.  If you like having giardia, you can drink it.  If you want it delivered in a pipe to your house, that is not free.
Yeah, I try to avoid it. No matter how well you cook it, it has a particular taste that identifies it as frozen.
Well, I'd say we're fucked then.
reminds me of how the history channel used to actually have... historical promgraming, or MTV actually had music videos.

I really do not like the direction the world has gone these last two decades.  (and yes... i mean for far more things then just television)
I assure you I'm quite calm and comfortable. 

Do you honestly feel, if they have the money, its within Nestle's rights to buy all the water on earth? There has to be checks in place, unfettered capitalism is not a good thing. Capitalism is great, but if left alone it'll kill us all. 


And again, you make it seem like humanity only evolved thanks to bottled water, I'm not hysterical, are you? How do you explain humanity, or any life, before Nestle?
Drinking untreated surface water will kill you.  Prior to the invention of water treatment, humans died in droves from waterborne illness.  If you drink from the headwaters of a river, above any human development, you'll get sick.
It would be interesting to know who the shareholders of these 10 companies, maybe someone should release that information :p
>The company actually pays the municipal rate, which is now $2.30 per 1,000 gallons, to the city of Evart for about a quarter of the company's annual bottling supply in Michigan.

Do they pay another city for the other 3/4? Also, why does the rest of the article say that Nestle "pumps for free?"
Flint local government run by local politicians voted by local voters screw themselves but Nestle is somehow to blame because they're in the same state, a state with an abundance of drinking water.

Its not even the same issue- Flint politicians couldn't figure out how to remove lead from their water and still kept getting re-elected. Imagine if Nestle couldn't figure out how to remove lead from their bottled water...
Bottling water barely makes a dent in water supply compared to agricultural/industrial uses.

Them paying municipal rates for water use actually benefits community members by ensuring the local water authority has funds to perform maintenance 
If the state has the power to tax nestle for using their own well water, nothing will keep the state from taxing homeowners for using well water from their own private wells.  

Granholm, the former govenor, actually suggested such a tax when she was in office.  
[Story of Stuff] (http://storyofstuff.org/#) is a great organization that has been working to stop nestles harmful bottling operations in California and around the country 
When you consider that it falls out of the sky and cost the state **NOTHING** to provide that fact that the State charges anything is egregious.
I'm sick of these stories about how Nestle is a monster for bottling water while Flint is in such a state. Water isn't a precious resource the majority of places and MI is one of those places that has more water than imaginable. Nestle pays the same price for water that every resident of the town does, and Nestle isn't responsible for what happened in Flint. That was the failure of the local government. Long story short, Nestle extracts less than .1% of the groundwater in the area and pays the same amount everyone else does for the water. 
NESTLE CAN'T SELL THE WATER TO ITSELF.

It is insane how rabid Reddit reacts to everything Nestle, yet NEVER acknowlege the HUGE FUCKINH ELE0HANT IN THE ROOM:

Someone SELLS the water in question TO Nestle.
Thus, the water is put up for sale by whoever has the legal authority to do so.
Nestle can't just set up shop at some local water source and start pumping out the resource, like some sort of thieves.

When I see the mass of such similarly venomous Redditor replies aimed at one, and only one, target - the evil, water theiving, Nestle Waters - with no more than the slightest concern for the why, or the how - I genuinely consider the possibility that some significant portion of the eplies I read here, that echo the seemingly unanimous sentiment of disdain for Nestle Waters, are manufactured by a single, and very interested, party intent on swaying public opinion.

Or, do most just not believe that Nestle is buying something that is already put up for sale by a second party?
There isn't a water shortage. There never will be. Even your pee gets recycled back into the earth. Water is plentiful. Water never leaves. It's water all the way down. 
Nestle pays the same rate as any other industry for their water. The food you eat takes more water. The beer you drink. The soda you drink.

>I do not deny that clean and safe water to drink or for basic hygiene is a human right. Of course it is. However, I do not think it is right that some people in the world do not have access to a clean, safe supply when others can use excess amounts for non-essential purposes without bearing a fairer cost for the infrastructure needed to supply it. When we give water a value, we use it more carefully, and this does not mean privatization. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-brabeckletmathe/addressing-the-water-chal_b_3152926.html
Why should they have to pay for groundwater on their land? Under OPs logic everyone with a well should pay a fee to the state for its use.


They aren't just doing it to michigan either they are sucking all of north america dry and giving little to nothing back to the communities they take from and no doubt doing it to other places on the planet. How you could live with yourself working for a company like this is beyond me. The same could be said for other companies like the oil industry etc. Either the people who run these companies from the top are evil or so blinded by greed they can't tell the difference between basic wrongs and rights.
We need a multi-state compact to regulate the export of Great Lakes water.  We need to get it treated like natural gas.  Nestle can be charged an 'export price' for their extraction.  I suggest the Great Lakes states call their cartel, 'The Organization of Water Exporting Territories', O.W.E.T.  
They do the same thing in Canada.  I despise this company and refuse to buy any of their products. 
[deleted]
Bottled water is more expensive at a gas station than gasoline... bunch of B$.
Looting public resources and selling it back to the public at a 1000% markup. This is what capitalism looks like
Hidden financial support.
Yea, that's a real reasonable thing to ask of the average flint resident.
Because it's contaminated.
People will always hate a company for taking something for almost nothing and turning it into a profit. The issue is when they take something incredibly scarce for next to nothing that people, businesses, and the environment not only need but are being charged extra for, and reselling it. 

During California's drought, they were sucking the water on expired permits for next to nothing and reselling it without shame. I boycott them for this reason and their numerous other unethical business practices.
[deleted]
Flint residents pay for leaded water, while a giant corporation gets clean water for free. America, fuck yeah! Who says we're not the best country in the world?
Because they're thieves and you're lucky they pay you at all! That's why they pay so little! When water permits expire, nestle does not renew them, they outright refuse to comply.

So I guess I'll end with a good ol' "boycott nestle!"
yea i am so confused, it claims they only pay $200 a year for "free' water than contradicts itself and says it pays municipal rate for 1/4 of its supply to one city. very misleading article. 
> Also, why does the rest of the article say that Nestle "pumps for free?"

Because this is a shit website that shouldn't be allowed on /r/news
Because people wouldn't be enraged if they reported this story in a factual and objective manner. 
Technically the Flint politicians couldn't figure out how to remove acid from the water.
Yeah flint's problem is infrastructure related not contaminated groundwater or inadequate groundwater.
Actually the city managers that were brought in were not elected by anyone, they were appointed by I want to say the Governor. They were the ones that chose to use water from the river that exposed the lead in their pipes.
Emergency managers are appointed by the governor to supersede any local elected authority.  Flint didn't always use the river for potable water until Snyder appointed an EM, whose main job is cut costs as a municipal dictator.

So, Flint is going on its third year with a poisonous water supply, and the state of MI thinks it's just as political as you want it to be, when in reality lead poisoning isn't some con.  Meanwhile, the US congressional investigation shut down right when it was time to subpoena the governor.

So really, the issue isn't so much how it's Nestle's fault, but pointing out how indecent it is to give credence and cost breaks to a company bottling tap water to sell, while a people within your jurisdiction are without safe water.


Furthermore, if nestle wanted to build a plant in my town I would almost certainly I've them huge cuts in "water prices" purely for the jobs it would create as long as the town had enough leftover water. 
Lost in all this is any consideration of who owns the water.  I live in Colorado, and we use a ton of water growing food.  But the farmers who use the water are also the people who own the water rights.  
Sure. But it's incredibly inefficient to truck bottles of water around.   That and they are marking it up by like 1000x.
I think it has largely to do with people's (IMHO justly heald)  negative opinion about bottled water. It's something that's largely available to most people yet they opt for the environmentally destructive (not in the pumping and selling of water but in the bottles themselves)  choice of convenience.  That's one of the major problems with our current form of capitalism it puts the consumer and the dollar above the health of the planet we rely on for literally everything. 
I imagine that in a place like Michigan with 40 inches of annual precipitation there is plenty of water to go around.  It is mostly places with less than 20 inches of annual precipitation where water becomes an extremely contentious issue.  It takes about 25 inches of water (could be a little more or less in some circumstances of course) to grow a normal crop to its full yield potential.
But... Greedy corporate profits and shit.
Yeah, $200 sounds amazing to maintain the now draining water supply
They have a great book, too.  I'm reading it right now 
Exactly what harm does providing drinking water to those who don't have access cause? Would that be more harm than, say, a brewery?
With Nestle, this nonsense is just how Nestle operates. Look up how Nestle operates in California. Nestle is a water vampire.

I think you're still missing the point.
> Flint [...] was the failure of the local government.

No, it was failure of the state government.


Currently live 5 miles south of Flint, born and raised in SouthEast Michigan

Most people, yourself included, have no idea what they're saying when they blame the local Flint government. This was 100% caused by the State government, particularly Governor a Rick Snyder 
Yes there is no shortage of water, but there is a shortage of potable water. That is what we are really talking about here. Nestle is pumping potable water and selling. 
According to [the transcript](http://lybio.net/tag/nestle-ceo-declares-water-food-that-should-be-privatized-and-not-a-human-right-transcription/) of his original speech, he never did say that water should not be a *human right*. He said that it shouldn't be a *public right* which isn't quite the same thing. He said that "one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water" which implies that clean water would be a human right.
> sucking all of north america dry

From the article:
>Michigan farms, parks and golf courses used 1.37 trillion gallons of water between 2005 and 2014, according to data kept by the DEQ. Most of that water came from groundwater wells for use as irrigation.

>By comparison, the five self-supplied Michigan water bottling operations the DEQ tracks groundwater withdrawal data on.. extracted 4.1 billion gallons between 2005 and 2015.

That's a 334x difference
>  they are sucking all of north america dry

They are being allowed to do this by the state and county gov't that gives them the permits to do so. 
>sucking all of north america dry

How much water do you think people drink?
This water is being sold to the great lakes basin region, it all goes right back in.


There are already a lot of very strict compacts regulating the export of Great Lakes water.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Compact
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Charter
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Water_Quality_Agreement

This plant isn't drawing water from a great lake, it is drawing ground water in central Michigan.  
Yeah. Where you'll hit snags is you likely don't have the millions and millions of dollars you would need to buy pumping equipment, a treatment facility, and all the engineers and technicians and their support staff to run the thing like Nestl√© is paying for. 

My parents have well water, they don't pay a dime to anyone to use it. Their costs are the pumping equipment and electricity to run it.
Sure. Nestle isn't the only bottled water company in the USA.
Costs money to clean, bottle, and transport that water. Bottled water (unless you buy a single bottle) isn't that expensive.
Nestle is still bottling water here in California. California is still in drought, mostly Southern California. 
Have you ever been to Michigan?  Water is not "incredibly scarce" there.  That is why it costs next to nothing.  
They were sucking water to provide drinking water. This would be in direct competition to the golf clubs, farms, and vineyards. 

Fun factoid of the day: Palm Springs, right next to Death Valley and the Mojave Desert, has 124 golf courses.
Apples/bananas. Flint's problem is infrastructure. They got plenty of water.
Flints water issue is related to their city pipes leeching lead, it isn't related to them not having source water.

How are the two related?
There's no lead in the Flint water source, it gets leeched out of the pipes. Any person or group in Flint could have a well dug themselves and also get water for free.
I'm not going back to look, but is it because they only pay the state of michigan $200 for the licensing paperwork?  The money going to the city of Evart goes to the city.  And that's great for Evart.  But the state of michigan, which is also suffering a detriment in losing water, is not being compensated for that.  That's just my guess though.
The 200$ is the paperwork processing fee, not for the water. The water itself is free since its on or adjacent to their land.
yeah but if you apply standards there goes the bbc, wapost and nyt to, better if people learn to sift through garbage to get the facts than just trust a source that will change over time.
if they already want to build a plant in your town, why give away more things for free? this is how cities get screwed by sports franchises
Yeah it's a tricky issue; they do own the water rights but the aquifer used is shared so it can be a tragedy of the commons style situation.
Besides, it's not like they're taking the water and shooting it into space. Some people only have access to clean water because of bottled water. If the only arguments against water bottling are NIMBY arguments, they're bad arguments.
You're phrasing it incorrectly.

The argument isn't whether providing water to those who don't have access is wrong. 

The argument is whether Nestle having nearly free access to a public water supply and turning it into a private water supply is wrong. 
Geez! You asked a question, in a genuine and non-confrontational manner, just seeking further explanation. But, Reddit downvoted you anyway because it didn't conform to the "fuck Nestle" message.

I hate this site so goddamn much sometimes.
none, but people think Nestle just pays a tiny fee to extract the water and that building a factory to pump, filter, store, bottle the water, all the maint., transport, workers ect. is free.
/r/hailcorporate 
Nestle/Arrowhead takes something like 32 million gallons of water from California/year. How much water is that? About 1/3 of what a single golf course in California uses per year.

>[In California, an average](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-california-golf-courses-are-responding-to-the-historic-drought-2015-5) 18-hole golf course sprawls over 110 to 115 acres and **conservatively uses almost 90 million gallons of water per year**, enough to fill 136 Olympic-size swimming pools, said Mike Huck, a water management consultant who works with golf courses statewide.

[The average farm application rate is](http://water.usgs.gov/edu/wuir.html) 2.35 acre-feet of water per acre. 32 million gallons is 98 acre-feet, so **Arrowhead takes as much water as a 42-acre farm**.

[A small family farm](http://www.fooddialogues.com/foodsource/farm-size-and-ownership/what-is-the-average-size-of-an-american-farm) averaging 231 acres, make up 88 percent of farms and 48 percent of total farm acres in the U.S.
Even in Cali the amount of water that Nestle consumed was negligible compared to the amount that was used in agriculture and to water golf courses. The positive side was that they were providing jobs, but the "news" still presented the story in a way to make it sound like Nestle was responsible for the shortage. In this case, Michigan has water all over the freaking place so they can't run with the water shortage spin, so they tie it to Flint which isn't even remotely Nestle's responsibility. 
Why is the state responsible for removing lead from the local water supply? Its always been local water department's responsibility and they answer to the local government.
Buy a farm and a packaging plant and sell your own water. Or, dig well on your property and only drink that water. No one makes you buy water. I drink water almost exclusively but rarely purchase it. Other than from my local municipality, "just like Nestle". (I agree, they are a horrible company). 
The water Nestl√© has pumped from Michigan comprises FAR less than 1% of all the water extracted during a given time period 
> there is a shortage of potable water

Not in Michigan there isn't.
Death Valley is almost three hundred miles north from Palm Springs.  Palm Springs sits in a valley between 10,800' Mt. San Jacinto, and 11,500' Mt. San Gorgonio, with both mountains providing abundant water run-off from spring snow melt, hence the word "Springs" in the city name of "Palm Springs".  You want dry Mojave desert. go out to Barstow.

What if they are choosing between you and the town over? Would you not want to incentivize them to choose your town?
In my area of California, under serious drought, and people are planting wine grapes like crazy.  It's absolutely a situation of "pump as much water as you can while you still can, make your money and GTFO when it's all gone".
Assigning property rights to one of the parties involved is one of the ways to combat the tragedy of the commons.
They pay the municipal fees. 

Is it wrong for farmers to pay the same municipal fees, use hundreds of times as much water as Nestle, and then sell their crops for profit? What about golf courses that make a profit off charging golfers for use?
> The argument is whether Nestle having nearly free access to a public water supply and turning it into a private water supply is wrong.

This isn't even close to what is happening.  You are not paying for water, you are paying for bottling and transportation (aka convenience) and in theory a minimum quality guarantee (e.g. no lead).

The water itself is nearly worthless in comparison to the rest, they should simply be charged at the same commcerial rates any other factory would be.
Not a public water supply if they are pumping groundwater. Surface water is public, though.
Do they have nearly free access to sunshine and air as well? 
Oh, I don't mind. If I didn't want downvotes, I wouldn't comment.
> Even in Cali the amount of water that Nestle consumed was negligible compared to the amount that was used in agriculture

Not to put to fine a point on it, but no duh!

California contains more than one fifth of all the US farms growing fruit, nuts and vegetables. Nothing is going to beat agriculture for water use in California, nor could it even hope to come close. 
But wouldn't the majority of the water used in agriculture and golf courses go right back into the ground? As opposed to water bottling where very little will be wasted. 
Because a state appointed official made the decision to switch Flint to a new water supplier.
Those springs (and the Colorado river) feed the aquifer beneath PS. The water table is [documented](http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/07/22/scientists-coachella-valley-aquifer-decline-continues/30531233/) as falling. The aquifer cannot sustain that many golf courses.
What does nestle have to do with flint?
The people of Flint, I'm sure, are concerned about the drinkability of their water. Just don't see where you're going with this. I'm also sure that the people of Flint are quite appreciative of bottled water, considering the alternative.
Conflating issues pretty hard here.  What you're saying is essentially no different than saying.  "Nestle gets water for free in Michigan but the homeless in Seattle don't have good access to safe drinking water?"

The issues just aren't related.  You're making them seem related because they both involve water.

Just to clarify, I think most people are upset with the extreme incompetence/negligence in Flint, but Nestle and the municipality they are in are really not obligated in any way to be involved.
Pull your head our of your ass and actually read the comment you are responding to.  Nobody said Flint doesn't have serious problems and need help, they said the problem isn't the quantity of water.  
It's not like Nestl√© is hooking up to a city pipe. Nestle is using its own pumping and treatment equipment to get the water from a spring source.

The pumping and treatment is essentially 100% the cost of water in places like Michigan where it's surrounded by literally a sea sized body of freshwater and where it falls from the heavens regularly. Unpumped and untreated water in michigan is worth zero. Given that nestle is doing the pumping and treatment themselves there's nothing really to charge them for.
It is just you, everybody else is smart enough to understand that these two issues are not at all related.  Nestle's bottling operation has no effect on the fact that Flint has lead pipes in their water system.  Nestle closing down their operation would do 0 to help Flint.  They are completely separate issues, despite the fact that they both have "water" and "Michigan" in their description.  Those words also show up in stories about rain, drownings, water sports, etc.  It doesn't make all of those the same thing.  
Not OP but it's definitely fucked that the state is selling water to Nestle when there are citizens who can't get good clean water. Then the local governments and others spend money buying back that water at the store because their tap water isn't safe. 
do you see where this is going? do you really want every city "bidding" for every possible new power plant or stadium? and what happens when no one in your town is a qualified hydro engineer so they bring in their own people?
I did the math and calculated that Nestle takes as much water in California as a 42-acre farm uses.
They issue is instead of paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, the just schmooze politicians, lobby, and outright buy off people to sell it to them.  

Just look at what they've done in Africa...they're not a benevolent corporation.  If they could block off your tap, bottle it, and charge you by the bottle, they would.  
Bro, if we can't blame a single entity, then it's just too much work to bother acting like we care.
Farmers and golf courses pay for and consume the water. Their product is not water.  Nestl√©'s product is water. 
Reagan used to tell a joke that the government would tax breathing if they could find a way how.

And then carbon taxes came along.
Well, I think you're agreeing with me, but just basically repeating what I said is an odd way to do it. 
No, it is absorbed by the plants that could not naturally grow there without it. A large chunk of it also evaporates.  
The way you worded that is a little confusing, so I'll just discuss the situation in Cali in general. The cool thing about water is that it basically recycles itself, but it might not be in the same area. Agriculture in Cali uses over 10 trillion gallons of water a year (all five of Nestle's plants in Cali consume about 0.001% of that amount). The majority of water used in agriculture evaporates. For most places the process wouldn't be a problem because it would just rain back down, but Cali is in a drought. That means the water lost to evaporation in Cali is being lost to the state because it is entering the jet stream and becoming rain somewhere else. A drought in one place means more rain somewhere else. 
I agree with you on the misuse of water at Palm Springs, it's just that that location is not the best choice for talking about waterless desert.  Anthropogenic climate change is inflicting serious drought on both of those mountains.  In addition to Palm Springs already over-drawing the local aquifer, the aquifer is now seeing a dramatic reduction in recharge.  The city Palm Springs will dry up and suffer a collapse in the not-too-distant future, it wont be missed.
He seems to think that because it's the same state Nestle and the municipality it's in is somehow blameworthy, either though it's two different municipalities in two different counties and two different utility districts.
That would be the cities faults. The local governments are failing at providing drinking water.
1. The state isn't really selling water to Nestl√©. Nestle isn't tapping into any government pipes. Nestle is simply using its own equipment to pump water from its own land. It's no different than a resident having a well.

2. Nowhere in the state is there a lack of water

3. The only place in the state with water issues is Flint, who has plenty of water but has crappy  pipes
So what is Nestl√© supposed to do? Give Flint free water because... reasons? 
Nestle is cleaning the water and selling bottled water to people who need it (in Flint). Otherwise they'd be stuck with no clean water.
So they bring in a hydro engineer. The bulk of the factory positions once built will still be staffed by locals. 
You're both right...

It sucks that we often can't discuss things like this without devolving to "fuck democrats and their minority plantation voters" vs "fuck entitled republican pieces of shit who wouldn't know oppression if it licked their butthole"
..............care to share the math then?
> They issue is instead of paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, the just schmooze politicians, lobby, and outright buy off people to sell it to them.

Source? I just stated in my previous comment... Nestle pays the same municipal fees as everyone else. Like farmers, who use hundreds of times more water and also make a profit. How and why would you craft legislation to slap Nestle with "hundreds of millions of dollars in fees" but avoid doing the same to farmers?

>Just look at what they've done in Africa...they're not a benevolent corporation. If they could block off your tap, bottle it, and charge you by the bottle, they would.

I'm not arguing they're "benevolent." I'm arguing they're playing by the same rules as everyone else and not doing anything particularly scummy or corrupt, at least not within the scope of this article.
Right, Nestle pays for the water and consumes it as well, in the form of putting it in bottles and selling them. Really, how is that different than the farm "consuming" it into their plants and then selling the crop?
You pay a carbon tax on breathing?
I'm saying that comparing any other water use in California to that used by agriculture is about as relevant as comparing a lemonade stand to GE.

Saying something uses less water than California agriculture as a justification for how much water was used would be like someone trying to justify their 100k in credit card debt by saying the US national debt is way higher than that. 
Yeah, that's fucked.
FYI, just because you own the land does not necessarily mean you have unlimited water rights to it.
[deleted]
1. Except there is no resident with a well, its nestle.
I wasn't trying to defend the statement of they're being a lack of water. Just that the situation is fucked. Imho bottled water should be illegal. 
[deleted]
I'm not suggesting that.
[deleted]
Nestle/Arrowhead takes 32 million gallons of water from California/year.

[The average farm application rate is](http://water.usgs.gov/edu/wuir.html) 2.35 acre-feet of water per acre. 32 million gallons is 98 acre-feet, so Arrowhead takes as much water as a 42-acre farm.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but won't a large portion of the water used in farming and golf courses return to the ground? It's being sprayed on what is essentially the ground. Surely the plants don't use 100% of the water sprayed on them? Conversely, Nestle would be returning very little of the water they pump back to the system, if none at all. 
Because no one else uses it after the farmers do. They are the end user, hence consume.  Nestle is not the end user. 
Carbon credits and carbon exchanges. It's for manufacturing, but it's the first step.
Nestle at Arrowhead takes as much water annually as a 42-acre farm (see calculation above in other comment). That's tiny.

They take as much water annually as 1/3 of an average Californian golf course.

They don't really take much water at all.
Ah; you're completely missing what I'm saying then. Let me give you an example. Cali produces almost the entire world supply of almonds. It takes a gallon of water to produce a single almond nut. So every time you eat a handful of almonds, you're wasting about 20 gallons of water. But nobody is bitching about almond farms, and everyone is losing their minds over Nestle even though the company makes far better use of the water they use. 
Any farm uses magnitudes more water
https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5jxiyp/z/dbk9jxz

Wow, it's almost like I already knew that
Nestle regionalizes bottling, this facility is only serving the Midwest basin area. 

No one is shipping Great Lakes water to China. Way to be uninformed.  
It's the same common law principal. Property owners have the right to tap their ground water if it doesn't negatively impact neighbors. Nestle stays under a court designated flow rate to respect this principal. 
It's a landowner getting water from their land.
> Imho bottled water should be illegal.

jesus christ are you for real?
Nestle is not pumping enough water to negatively impact anything. 400 GPM is pretty paltry in terms of industrial water use.

 Where would you suggest Midwest residents get their bottled water from. 
You think the Cowboys are making the SB? 
Ignorant about what? Are you saying that the people of [Flint aren't drinking bottled water](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/us/iyw-flint-michigan-water-crisis-how-to-help/index.html) in lieu of lead pipe contaminated city water?
Thank you.
I suppose it depends on what you mean by large portion.  Yes, quite a bit does, but a very large portion is used by the plants.  
Honest question, what do you think ultimately happens to the water you drink?  Do you think it vanishes?
Aquifers recharge very slowly from surface watering; you're technically right that farming would return it faster but it's still a process measured in decades
huh? i don't think you get his point, both of these organisation pay the same amount to access the water, why does it matter how they use it? one waters crops, harvests them and sells them, the other treats the water, bottles it then sells it.
The problem is "government" is just other humans.  Some humans will try and make money anyway they can and if they happen to be involved in government they can influence tax, yes.  Others will try and make as much money as they can without regard for safety and environmental impact.  The carbon tax is not an arbitrary tax on an element in the air, but a tax on a process that negatively effects the environment in which we live.  It has nothing to do with charging anyone for a basic function of life. 
No, it's largely for power plants.
You really think carbon taxes to protect our crumbling environment is the first step to the government taxing the air we breathe?  
Well, lets consider why that might be.

You have to eat something. Yes, the almonds might use up more water than some other edible crop, but I think you'll find that most crops use a fair bit of water to produce.

So, the farm using the water is bringing us a tangible benefit, food we need to eat. 

What is the benefit offered by Nestle for their use of the public water supply by contrast?

They are taking already drinkable water, and simply packaging it and marking up the cost. They add some amount of portability, but their average consumer is near enough to another water source that it provides nothing but minimal convenience. 

Do you see how someone might feel that the farmers use of that water to produce a crop might be looked at differently that Nestle's use of that water to product a profit?
Your comment implies otherwise
Yeah. The production is pretty insane. And the plastic waste is out of control. There's a bottling plant going full steam to create the product. Then it's shipped by truck to retail locations... For a bottle of water. Maybe I should clarify... I don't think it's at all necessary and is incredibly wasteful in places that have other means of water readily available. In the US and most of the developed world that would just be tap. 
I really hope so. The Seahawks are pretty scary though.
I think it is waste, and in some places it is treated and turned into potable water. Other places I imagine it's dumped into water ways and such. 

But that's unrelated to what I was talking about unless most of the water bottled in a state stays in the state. Since it is shipped around the country (and possibly elsewhere) it is taking the water further from the source than agriculture. 
Water? Like from the toilet?
The Nestle plants in Cali use groundwater which isn't suitable for drinking. The plants have to purify it. They're not like other companies that just purify tap water. Nestle doesn't treat water the same way tap water is treated. They use a more expensive process because they know that all of the water they treat will actually be consumed. Many people prefer bottled water for this reason. It doesn't have off tastes from a chemical treatment process and it doesn't contain chlorine or fluoride. 
no it doesn't and the article itself states that if there is a determent to the water supply they can not keep extracting the water by law.
Reddit isn't necessary. Should we ban it?
lol 90% of what people consume isn't necessary, we could get around wearing a toga and eating a paste of nutrients made in a vat, but most people like to choose the shit they consume, i.e water, why do you think your belief should be imposed on the majority of other people who don't agree with you?
I still don't think it should be illegal but you make a good point.

At the very least it should be treated as a "luxury" item like sodas and consumed sparingly. 
Good luck, should be a fun tournament! 
To be clear everything you drink is ultimately returned to the water table. Everything. In fact you actually produce more water than you consume

And Nestl√© regionalizes sales, Michigan water is sold to the great lakes basin area. It's not draining the region, people are drinking and peeing it right back into the water table. 
Gigantic useless distraction. Agriculture sucks up 75% of California's water.
[deleted]
This is just distraction pushed by interest groups and lobbyists paid for by the farmers of California. If you drive down Central California you'll see plenty of crazy signs blaming Nancy Pelosi and Barbra Boxer for creating the water crisis, and not providing even more water for the farmers in Central California. These farmers want more water without regard for the drought, and have plenty of paid friends to help push their agenda.

Don't forget all the coke, sprite, etc, plus all the beer. It isn't only plain bottled water.
Stepping over the dollar bills to pick up the pennies. You Californians are an odd bunch. 
Meanwhile, the farmers are sitting back hoping the people of California remain oblivious to the real problem.

How many are protesting almond growers?
So in the middle of a huge drought people are protesting against the tiny portion of the water use devoted exclusively to drinking. By humans.
Good job California your slacktivism of signing petitions and nothing else will reduce water usage in California by .002%. You can now sit back happy you solved the problem 
Signatures? Oh *no*, the *humanity*....not *SIGNATURES*! Whatever will they *dooooooo*?

Dropping sales, sure: That'd get a quick-as-fuck response. Signatures? Somebody in an office will do the old-white-man equivalent of "lol...k".
I don't understand why people are so upset. It isn't like they are cross drilling and stealing water. They are paying for water carried in by the cities pipelines. It isn't free. They are paying for water, processing it and reselling it. So because an area lacks a natural resource, a company shouldn't be able to freely purchase said resource? 
I live in Michigan. I can't relate to your problems at all.  Good luck. 
I have a hard time believing that bottled water facilities use a significant percentage of California's water.  
[Really useful article](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/) detailing the amounts of water used for various purposes in California.

Look over there at that misdirection! 
Stop buying bottled water ...?

Is it going to be so much better if Nestle bottles the water in Idaho and they have to truck it down?  The buck stops with the consumer.
100% of Nestle California bottled water is sold in California and drank by Californians. So people of California would rather shut this down, and have trucks bring them bottled water from other states? wasting more gasoline and producing more pollution?
The golf industry has been successful in drawing public attention away from themselves, despite using many thousands times as much water (agriculture uses most of the water of course, but at least  they feed people). 
Literal drop in the bucket.

Quit raising cattle and reduce agricultural use by about 10% and problem solved.

It's CA's laws and regs that are messed up, not Nestle shipping a few hundred thousand gallons out a year.  That won't even feed a single almond grove.
Ffs its the agriculture industry you fucking retards!
And it's the useful ignorant like these asses that I ducking HATE California.
Instead of protesting, stop buying bottled water?
You live in a desert.  What do you expect?  Don't live in a desert.
500,000 people actually signing a petition for something like this is scary as fuck. I really wish people would be more informed before doing things like this. 
California gets about 80 million acre feet of water per year.  About half of that is for protected streams and lakes.  So 40 million acre feet roughly is available for agriculture and drinking water, etc.

The Nestle plant consumes about 215 acre feet of water.  Out of 40 million acre feet.  That's literally a drop in the bucket.
California also just had an oil spill.  Makes me sad. 
http://time.com/3891739/california-oil-spill-jerry-brown-state-of-emergency/
I'm sure this will make a huge dent in the drought.  Good lord people are dumb.
So people are protesting Nestle over this, and not over their practices in the third world that literally kill people?  
  
And people are protesting a bottling plant rather than the many other companies that use far more water?  
  
Everything about this is wrong. It's either protesting the right company for the wrong reasons, or it's the right reason but the wrong company. 
ITT: Agriculture is wasting water! We should start watering our plants with Brawndo to save water!
Don't they know that most of the water goes to agriculture.
Way to protest the tiniest part of the problem CA ... what, afraid to tackle the real issues?
How much of that water gets sold back to people in California. Whats the effect of those Californians having to then get their water elsewhere. The bottling plant is most likely is more efficient in it's bottling operation than  the average person is filling up their own containers from the faucet.
they're not stealing the water. if you're going to get mad over every bullshit thing that happens, then at least be mad at the right people. everyone blaming nestle for this is a big stupid useless piece of shit
It's not my green lawn that's the problem! It's all those people growing food that people eat all around the world! 

-California
How about just stop buying Nestle products!!! These guys who have no problem with ethics are NEVER gonna listen to some dumb petition. Take away what they care about most..MONEY!
Come on, why is this still the front running conversation... Why do we let media guide our logic, this is complaining about a drop in the bucket instead of the gallon of water in the bucket. Not every drop counts.
This will probably get buried but regardless of whether bottled water is attributing heavily to the drought or not, Nestle's CEO is the same dude who believes that water isn't free & agrees that collecting rainwater should be outlawed. Which it actually is in some states. I don't know, that to me is terrifying.
Fuck you nestle! You are bottling water we could be drinking! 

**Sips beer (or soda, wine, etc.)**
The California "drought" is completely man made. Why should a business shut down and lay off employees just so environmentalists can create a problem as a publicity stunt to gather support from the public? . What is fucked up is y'all would rather see thousands of people laid off of work as long as you get to promote (force) your ideology on the populace. Instead of feeling guilt y'all feel self-righteous as if you are doing a good thing. 
It is interesting, the comment thread is just people arguing  back at forth about the merits of bottling water vs using it for farming. No one discusses the issues that the west inherently has concerning water
They imposed restrictions on farmers and cut them off completely from using San jouaqin supply

But keep circle jerking
If Nestle is smart. They would move their water operations to Hamilton, Ohio. It's been voted 'Best water in America' many times. 
Nestle is up there with FIFA when it comes to politically incorrect business ventures.
You gotta love California. When the majority of their water consumption is used on farms (inefficiently-so, I might add), they'd rather go after a bottling company that uses a laughably minute fraction of water in its operations. Sure. Chase all those jobs out of your state if you wanna; Nestle, why don't you come to my state? We could use the jobs.
> It‚Äôs driven by consumer demand, it‚Äôs driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate,‚Äù

An "On-The-Go society" is a society that lacks the time to sit in their own kitchen and drink a glass of water. Their status as proletarian consumers doesn't leave time for things like relaxed meals, always on the go means that the demands of Capitol usurp basic human needs.

More Americans need to get this. In that sense advertising that proclaims "You're so busy you need to buy our product to reclaim some of your stolen time!" is deeply offensive as I am not one to celebrate my status as a slave to an unsustainable schedule.
I stand in solidarity with Nestl√©. If these idiot Californians want to protest wasteful water use and the real reason California is in a drought, then they need to march their asses right up to the almond farms. After all, what's more wasteful: bottling water that's guaranteed to be meant for drinking, or using 5 gallons of water to grow 1 almond?
Something, something agriculture. 
California wouldn't be out of water if people didn't try to build a huge oasis in the middle of the freaking desert, where's the logic...
They are just now starting a new operation in McBee, South Carolina. Just passed the base of operations, (a sixty year old home right outside of town on the highway), yesterday. 
How terrible! People are actually using water to DRINK in California. Disgusting.
The Desert Sun published an investigation revealing that Nestl√© Water's permit expired over 27 years ago. I bet they haven't paid a dime in taxes either. Their CEO doesn't give a fu*k about anything except the old mighty $.
Petitioning a multibillion-dollar corporation to stop doing what is bringing in billions is just plain useless.  Instead, they should be petitioning the hell out of whichever governing body has the power to shut this operation down.
[deleted]
CA Resident. Let me explain this further. We are told that , as homeowners have to cut OUR water usage back by another 25%. Corporations like these scumbags are allowed to take the water and infrastructure we pay for, not cut back and it's ok. 

We have had meetings with local water districts where the water board folks showed up and put their dog and pony show on. When confronted by several angry residents they left speechless. Yes Ag does use a lot of water, however if you want to eat you need to grow food. California is a leading producer of many food items we also feed much of the state ourselves. Ag has moved to less water intensive growing procedures so blaming them is a red herring.
If you were in a position to buy 1 bottle of water for $1 and sell it for $100, would you?
Blow up the facilities.
Want results?

Skip the petition and hit them right where it hurts ---- ***boycott*** is the word you are looking for.
Tim Brown is a fucking piece of shit. I'd hang him myself
Stupid idiots!  They should be protesting those environmental initiatives that dump billions of gallons of drinking water into the oceans to save these 5 or 6 species of fish.  They should be protesting for farms to upgrade to more efficient irrigation systems (the farms have fought this for decades).  

Getting rid of these bottling factories won't make much of a difference.  Hell, even if the entire Southern California population disappeared, it would not get us out of the drought.
The simple and direct solution would be for someone to disrupt the water pipelines enough to make it costs prohibitive for Nestle to bottle water.
just a reminder how stupid Californians are

they go after the one group that is responsible for less than one percent of the water problem


This isn't going to be solved by petitions to the facilities.

This is going to be solves two ways.  

1) Government kicks them out

2)The facilities get destroyed
Of all the ways to use water, putting it into a bottle where it will almost certainly be drunk by a human may just be the least wasteful.
also, that bottled water is probably consumed by humans. I doubt that stopping sales of bottled water would cause people to consume less water.
I'm so tired of hearing this. Yes, I know. Agriculture is the big water sink.

But do you know why people are pissed off at nestle? Because in a time where everybody is supposed to be cutting back and easing away from extravagant usage of water, nestle keeps the taps running. Nestle isn't pumping it for necessity, but for a luxury. 

Sure, people will need water to drink, but do you really think the bottles are getting shipped where drought has forced people to drink from ditches? No, it's going to end up in grocery stores and vending machines. People are mad at nestle for using water for luxury in a time that calls for restraint.

"But nestle's bottling is only a drop in the bucket!" In hard times, I thought every drop counted. I'm NOT saying that the agricultural industry is blameless. 

Oh fuck, I'm commenting before sleeping again. here come the downvotes.

edited to a word.

Another edit: bottler conservation and farmer conservation aren't mutually exclusive. Everybody should be saving water, including the bottlers and the agricultural sector. 


^sometimes ^you ^really ^have ^to ^spell ^it ^out, ^damn.
Golf courses 
Protesters get thirsty. Someone please bring these guys some bottled water.
This "either/or" logic makes no sense to me.  This is a waste of water, *and* there should be some thoughtful prioritizing about water use in agriculture.  
Doesn't mean nestle is blameless.  
Wouldnt it be possible to make the water system for ag a closed system?
I'm torn on agricultural use of water. I like eating probably as much as I like drinking.
Californians, willing to protest, no willing to give up nice weather for a more rainy area.
pretty sure its >80%
> Agriculture sucks up 75% of California's water.

[80%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/04/03/agriculture-is-80-percent-of-water-use-in-california-why-arent-farmers-being-forced-to-cut-back/)

Agriculture needs to be more efficient, but food production is one of the best things for world peace.  So, I think adding another source for the water through desalinization.  Water treatment and collection from storm drains.  Would significantly improve California's water future, and would be expensive.
But, we seem to have this illogical tendency to hail farmers as some sort of altruistic fucking heroes rather than simply merchants engaged in business for the pursuit of their own self-interests.  
Oh Oh, I know this one!!! Its the 'look at the bigger example to make this example seem less important tactic'!!!

*Your comment* is the useless distraction. This practice is clearly unosncionable, regardless of its scope. 

This problem requires systemic change, not cherry picking. Putting an end to bottling water from sources that are themselves incapable of supplying the populations they serve is a necessary step toward sustainability. 
I'd be willing to be the agriculture lobby is behind the petitions against nestle.
What's the Jobs/water ratio between Agriculture and bottled water?  I'm sure Ag employees more people per gallon of water consumed then water bottling operations. 
Farming Companies with wasteful water practices. 
[deleted]
Bottled water isn't a big deal. People fucking love bottled water, and it only accounts for a small fraction of the water used in the state. People should be pissed at their legislatures for subsidizing agribusiness. That industry is hands down the largest consumer of water in the state, and the government subsidize all of it.

The god damn government needs to let businesses pay the market price for the resources that they use. Agriculture subsidation is absolutely rediculous in this country, but incentivizing over-use of an essential scarce resource takes the fucking cake. If water prices were higher, businesses would use less of it, and California drought  situation wouldn't be this dire. That's the first reform that needs to happen.
Meanwhile, my apartment, in the Bay area, continues to run the sprinklers every day (rain or shine) to keep the tropical plants in our landscaping green.
What blows my mind is just the sheer amount of misdirection going on. Everyone is furious at nestle(Which is it's own can of worms, nestle is a shit company) for bottling there and while if they stopped it might help, nestle is a tiny percentage of the water issue.

We have to look at agriculture fixes, as they are the lions share of the water use. I'm not saying no farming but looking for more efficient means. 
Since residents don't tend to make profit on their water, does this mean Nestle also makes no profits? 

100% of 0 is still 0. 
So the people of California can be thirsty AND unemployed.
>buying at the same rate as residents and selling at one hundred times the profit.

Only if one disregards the costs of bottling, distributing, and stocking their product.
Have you ever met an American ?

Do these idiots think that the drought is a lie and that "Evil Liberals" are somehow hoarding the water?

Fuckwits.
I don't care if it's 1% or less, no one has any business selling water to other places from a place that already has issues with water.  There's reasonable use, and then there's just wastefulness.  I can't believe people are defending Nestle.  
Not only that, that shit actually gets drunk by people. Not wasted on Alfalfa to ship to the Chinese or what have you.

This is the epitome of manufactured scandal. 

On the bright side, whenever some left wing Democrat whines about the right and crony capitalism, this event will serve to showcase that both parties are the same in essence.

Good going Jerry Brown you piece of shit.
It's mostly agriculture. Nestle does not deserve protests, people should eat less meat. Meat takes up a LOT of water, so if demand goes down, supply goes down, and less water will be used for meat.
Don't forget the delta smelt! They only found a single fish in the last census. 


http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/19/california-delta-smelt-survey-turns-up-1-fish/
Here's all you need to know.

People only get 20%

Big ag gets 80%

This ratio is fucked
The whole discussion is very simple.  Water is subsidized for agriculture.  Because of this, the farmers grow crops which would not be economically feasible during a drought, as water prices naturally increase during a drought.  So, the shortage gets worse as farmers continue to consume water at very high rates due to government control of water price for farmers.  The end.
Almond growing isn't as bad as the irrigating of alfalfa (animal feed) - https://imgur.com/eNXiCzm
Or the cattle ranchers? Dont get me wrong, i love me some meat but it takes a shit load of water to producer a pound of meat. 
Stop it your going to make the price of almonds go up. Then where will I get my almond milk
So, we can't be worried about both?
they do use quite a  lot, and it is more about them buying up water for almost nothing (something that residents could definitely use) and selling it for huge profits while the people of California are having their water usage closely monitored  
"Quit raising cattle"

What?
[deleted]
Nestle deserves the protests though.
Of course they did, funny how oil companies seem to have issues with infrastructure right when prices go down.
Its a proxy.  Activists that hate Nestle worked up a populist lather on this, but the origin is their hatred of Nestle.

Look in the article:  the Nestle guy is quoted as saying they are the SECOND largest bottler in the state.  Who's first, and are they getting protested?

Similarly, the walmart protest was motivated purely by existing dislike of Walmart.  Walmart charges 88c per gallon for processed water, but the article suggested they weren't as nice as Starbucks, who is bottling outside the state--but the fact that Starbucks charges over 15x the price of Walmart never seemed to make the analysis...
If we could solve problems based on human impact rather than heat of the moment activism the world would be a better place.
Its not about the amount of water companies use, its what there using it for in the middle of a drought, would you expect farmers to cut back? no, they grow the food you fuckers to eat. but do you NEED bottled water? no, its called a tap.
It's what plants crave.
do you know how much and jobs the ag industry supplies? Do you know what happens when you abandon farms? you get dustbowls and the soil gets massively eroded.  What about the thousands of people who will now be jobless? Where do you house them, how do you feed them, how do they survive?  It's not as easy as just cutting water to ag. 
[deleted]
> why is this still the front running conversation

Because Nestle is a controversial enough target for American Democrats to pick on but they are afraid of solving and picking on the actual issue at hand: big ag.


He's also clarified his statement that companies that use water (like his own) should be paying their worth...but if they're not going to charge him he's not going to pay it.
What he's arguing is basically that if you charged a fair price for water instead of giving it away almost for free, there wouldn't be a shortage in the first place. I have not heard the thing about collecting rainwater, but essentially that would be the same thing as taking water from the ground. If you are not allowed to dig a well and extract water from it, why would you be allowed to collect rainwater?
And he is right. If agricultural users were charged the same price that residential users are, there wouldn't be a water shortage.
>Nestle's CEO is the same dude who believes that water isn't free

Rather than charging Nestle the same rate as everyone else for water, they should give them the water for free! That would teach them!
The fact that it's a fucking desert with a shit load of people wanting green grass?
Did you actually read the article you are referencing? Nestle has made all the proper applications and paid all the fees over the past 27 years. The STATE has not acted on their applications, which according to the STATE law allows Nestle to continue their operations until the STATE acts. 

If you want to be pissed over a process that uses less than a fraction of a percent of the water in California and doesn't affect the drought situation in any meaningful way, at least be pissed at the right entity.
How so?
Scumbags like [these almond growers who are expanding their orchards despite the drought?](http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/article18716937.html) You need a luxury food like almonds that much, or are they chasing profits while using subsidized Californian water as well?
The bulk of California''s food needs are met from outside of the state. Why not reduce farming of crops that can be met elsewhere until the drought situation is resolved? This should only have a minimal impact of prices and solves the water needs currently being faced. Raisins and Almonds are tasty but far from a necessity and there are several other crops that could easily be shifted to other parts of the country where water isn't an issue.
Time to stop shitting in a toilet, dig a latrine in the backyard!
This is completely true its being used by people. The thing I dont really agree with is if this water wasnt being bottled and resold at a 1000x markup wouldnt it be smarter to keep it in the municipal water supply so people can drink that same water at a low cost?

Realistically nothing will really change until agriculture gets its shit in order. 
A human in California, most likely.
Point is, Nestl√© is bottling water in an area with severe drought and shipping/selling it outside of said area.
Therefore they are at least part of the problem.
Plus: The CEO of Nestl√© Waters North Amercia seems to be a huge arse. :)
If they're gonna bottle water that's fine, but it should be priced correctly. A company shouldn't be paying the same as a resident to bottle water and sell it at a huge markup. If the costs increase they'd probably leave. 
Yeah but it another state that probably already has water. 
Yes and selling California's *imcredibly* limited water supply out of state and country for massive mark up seems like a good idea and not an issue to you? I mean c'mon, these asshats are literally stealing California's water from them and are unashamed of it in the slightest, they're even planning on upping their operations.
>putting it into a bottle where it will almost certainly be drunk by a human may just be the least wasteful

It kind of is if that human lives in a place where the water levels are fine, isn't it?  
Really?  What about the polluting features of those plastic bottles? And why would you want to sell a precious resource to people who live in states where there is ample water, when your state doesn't have enough?
Yes, but taking it from an area affected by a heavy drought and selling it across the country in areas that have perfectly safe water from the tap is just evil.
The problem is they are bottling it and exporting it out of state.  If they restricted sales to in-state people would have nothing to complain about. 

On the other hand, why don't they just stop water consumption in CA now and import bottled water from places that have plenty? It's not like there's a water shortage around the world.  

I mean, Literal _mountains_ of ice are falling off of Antarctica and Iceland!  Bottle it and sell it in California. It wouldn't even increase the costs by much. 
Never underestimate the ignorance of the mob. Or as James Madison referred to it, the tyranny of the majority. 
By Californians or people out of state that aren't experiencing a draught? 

>But do you know why people are pissed off at nestle? Because in a time where everybody is supposed to be cutting back and easing away from extravagant usage of water, nestle keeps the taps running. Nestle isn't pumping it for necessity, but for a luxury. 

"But nestle's bottling is only a drop in the bucket!" In hard times, I thought every drop counted. 


What portion of agriculture qualifies as a luxury, though? There are a lot of products farmed from oranges to almonds that aren't staple foods. This is completely separate from the fact that many irrigation methods used waste tons of water that are horribly outdated. 

At the end of the day, the agriculture industry reducing it's water usage by 1% would reduce consumption more than Nestl√© shutting down completely in California.

Unfortunately in a world of limited resources (time being a major one for people) it is dumb to use so much to target a maximum 1% fix. This is a common optimization problem. Resources should be put towards the biggest impact (agriculture, golf courses, etc) first. The problem is people get too emotional and can't look at issues objectively. Its easy to hate a big foreign corporation but if you put bias aside, you would realize attacking nestle on this is only making the water issue worse since less resources are being used to actually address the major water users. We are losing valuable time and.. Water. This is the problem with "mob" mentality.. Too much emotion. 
Your point seems so obvious to me... thanks for putting it so well.
less than a tenth of 1 percent........

let that sink in, less than a tenth of 1 percent

this is a giant waste of time and is nothing but anti corporation 's


You are *completely* right on this, and I don't know why anybody would say otherwise.

***EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS AT THIS POINT***, and people are just playing the blame game and passing the buck! It's fucking ludicrous!
I agree with you but some of the agriculture being grown are luxury crops as well that are sold to china ie. almonds, pecans
[removed]
The problem is that during a drought food prices should go up, water is one of the important inputs into food production and when it gets more scarce water should be charged a lot more for, and thus prices should go up.

But the agricultural lobby is very powerful and people are big babies and they don't want their food prices to go up, even when the laws of supply and demand dictate they should.

So all the water rationing and conservation in the world isn't going to help the drought when 80% of the water consumption gets a free pass.
Better than the "Look at this minor example so you *don't* look at the more important, destructive example" attitude articles like this (and the industry heads who push such articles) are selling.
>systemic change, not cherry picking. 

Excuse me while I cherry pick at the water bottlers. 
Bingo

Big ag has been on a PR rampage last few months because we're literally sinking the earth from sucking water out.

We're looking at fines and water police and higher taxes, while these guys take 80% the water

Their only defense is "well we have water rights" or "we grow food". Every argument they make is taken apart in moments.

Their real argument is "we bribed the shit out of your politicians so fuck you"
Personally I think that water "wasted" on farming, where the unneeded water is at least staying in the local ecosystem, is much better than bottling water from a drought area to sell at enormous profit to areas that are not experiencing a drought. But that must just be me. 
Ok here is the thing... farmers don't have time machines. They didn't know a drought would happen. There was always enough water, there was NO REASON to use the hella expensive methods that save water. You wouldn't, no one reading this would. If you think you would you are full of shit. You like everyone else in the world would use the cheapest method that is good enough. Again....water wasn't an issue until the drought... its called a drought people, changing their methods won't make it rain. Everything will go back to how it used to be before any legislation or laws happen. 

Its going to suck for a bit but whatever.  
gonna bust your bubble and say that ag doesn't waste water, it's our most expensive input and there's a shit ton of science and data collection that goes into ensure we're irrigating at peak efficiency...so yeah
Making food vs selling you WATER. Yeah...
[deleted]
Believe it's one tenth the rate we pay
yeah you know why we subsidize agriculture? because we need food and we need it to be cheap, also most ag doesn't receive subsidies beyond tax free gasoline or minor business tax breaks.  The corn subsidies out west are the actual wasteful subsidies
I think people should be more pissed off that the state with the largest drought also has the longest shoreline of any other state and the shore is on the single largest body of water on earth, but the tried and true desalinization technology isn't even considered.
> Bottled water isn't a big deal. People fucking love bottled water, and it only accounts for a small fraction of the water used in the state. 

Why not bottle water from other places, and bring it **to** CA, rather then the other way around? 

For the money they're charging they could easily afford a desalination plant. 
During drought times they should switch to a progressive pricing system for water and set the rates control usage.
That pisses me off.  Everyone on the block where I grew up has been forced to switch to a no-water or a low-water yard.  My parents actually have a really cool setup, so it's all rocks and desert plants and looks really boss.  Some of the houses are just paving and putting in a basketball hoop.  Some are letting the grass die.  But this ONE asshole has all these beautiful flowers and bushes and continues to water his lawn twice a day, to excess so the water is dripping down the sidewalk and running into the gutter.  Everyone's just waiting for his ass to get fined.
We have looked to AG uses.  The issue with nestle isn't water usage it's being allowed to operate in a drought without a permit.
You cant really blame them for that
Probably the same people who feel that climate change research and its findings are just bullshit activist science.
From Reddit it looks more to me like it's idiots thinking that "Evil Conservatives" are bottling the water. 

But Fuckwits is correct.
Are you also going to shut down all the soda factories, breweries, and every other major industry that uses water?

Will you shut down all the waterparks as well? How about making it illegal to have a swimming pool? Surely that is much more wasteful than bottled water. What about Golf courses, they actually use more water than Nestle does, will you shut those down as well?
>There's reasonable use, and then there's just wastefulness.

Yes, and people are defending it because this is a reasonable use. There's nothing wasteful about drinking water. Even if Nestle took out that bottling plant today, water consumption will remain the same because people in California aren't going to drink less water. You're mad because Nestle gets to profit off a basic commodity people consume everyday, I get it. But in the actual big picture of things, consumption of water isn't going to be magically reduced just because you take out Nestle. Spend your efforts on something that actually will make an impact.
What do you think California agricultural products are made of? Have they figured out some magical way to make milk that contains zero water and just haven't told me? If not, are you ok with them immediately shutting that industry down completely?
What's with the side swipe at the Chinese?
I totally agree, I'm just pointing out that if you wanna get mad about this, you should be mad at the entirety of the problem.
Can't wait to get that water back. They've re-routed a bunch of the rivers in the Valley for that fish that really doesn't provide anything, and there are barely any left.
Can someone explain this to a non-Cali.

I always assumed the reason why it isn't 50/50 is because there was not enough demand before the drought to give 50%?
not quite, the environment gets 40% (ie the delta and it's puny little smelt fish) and 40% goes to ag which FEEDS YOU and 20% is used to keep your grass green and you freshly showered.  The 80% doesn't mean 80% of the entire water supply, and honestly what do you expect happens when you cut water to ag? All the jobs lost and thousands of people left without income, a serious loss of food supply, and the inevitable dustbowl that will sweep ca once all that plowed land stops being farmed?  It's not a simple as going stop water to ag
> Big ag gets 80%

Because "big ag" doesn't serve tens of millions of people, right? I'm sure you tens of thousands of "little guy" farmers can be more efficient. **/sarcasm**
That implies agriculture is the only industry in California that consumes water. Why can't it just be:

People get 20%  
Corporations get 80%
Yeah, but changing that requires going vegetarian, and I'm definitely not doing that.
Stats say beef takes less water.
How you gonna get milk from almonds?
they ain't even got titties.
Yes, I control the weather.
If agriculture had to pay fair market value for water, the price of almond milk would go up a few cents tops. Beef, on the other hand, would see a much steeper rise.
Flax milk is just as good!
How does one milk an almond?
The entire U.S. bottled water market was about 10 billion gallons in 2013. The city of Los Angeles goes through that amount of tap water in less than three weeks.  If you're going to be pissed at the bottled water companies, be pissed about the plastic.  
They use less than 0.01%. 4 billion cubic meters or 1 billion gallons. That's it.

California uses somewhere in the range of 13 trillion gallons per year.

You're correct about the profits but you're blatantly incorrect about the  degree of water usage.
The agricultural sector uses up substantially more water than what is bottled
[Livestock use 9% of CA's water](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wulv.html).  Raise cows where the water is, not where it's scarce.
Explain to me how Nestle is bad again?
Even more that the company who did this is from were I'm from. Houston
Like Deepwater Horizon? No, that was while prices were at record highs.

Sabotaging your own infrastructure because prices are low would be a monumentally stupid decision.
Whether you get your water from the tap or a bottle is irrelevant, you still consume the same amount of water... The amount of water used for bottles is ~0.002% and only the exported bottles can be called waste. So it's only a small fraction of the already tiny amount of water they use that's actually waste.
Very little.

Agriculture is less than 2% California's economy.

Agriculture is the biggest user of migrant labor and pays shit
The same could be said of the people who work in the water plants or any industry. Ag is using water inefficiently planting almonds and pistachios in the desert! Addressing that would alleviate the water issue more than this stupid protest. Nobody is asking people to stop farming but you cant plant cash crops in water deprived regions!! Plant something that is better suited to use the local resources.
I didn't ask any of this, I simply pointed out the obvious most of the water goes to agriculture no doubt about it. Now you can either prove me wrong or prove me right. I'm actually very interested in your questions, if you have the answers I'm all ears.
It is. You cut water to agriculture because agriculture can afford to install drip irrigation systems. Drip irrigation uses less water and improves yields, but farmers are riding out their water right benefits instead of investing in the long-term sustainability of the water table.
You have to wash the glass. 
the way I see it is that you can distinguish the source of the water easier when it's coming from the ground. There are property boundaries, etc. How do you distinguish the property boundaries/source of rainwater other than knowing that it came from precipitation in the atmosphere? I mean, I don't know but that's the way I've always looked at it.
By keeping it safe for later use
They also are using drip style irrigation so the water is spotted to the tree directly
Almonds are a luxury food item now?
Depends on where the toilet water goes.
[deleted]
They won't drink most of it. They'll use it watering their lawns and taking longer showers. 100% of bottled water goes to drinking, arguably the most important use that can can be thought of.
>The thing I dont really agree with is if this water wasnt being bottled and resold at a 1000x 

So step in, step up, and start bottling water at only 10x as oppose to 1000x the markup.

You are now an American Hero.  A rich one at that, sticking it to these big evil corporations and taking their business.  

Instead, you'll just complain on reddit, and do nothing besides jerk off to bizarre porn in a side-tab.  Actions speak louder than memes


It wouldn't  change a thing. The amount is so small.
But from a percentage standpoint this business makes up less than 1% of the water used in the state. This is like fighting a fire in a fireplace (small, under control, and its intended purpose) while a wildfire burns outside taking thousands of acres of land and homes and businesses.
>Plus: The CEO of Nestl√© Waters North Amercia seems to be a huge arse. :)

This seems less like an aside, and more like the main point from which most people are constructing their argument.

People don't care for this company. I certainly don't. However, "I don't care for this company" is not a valid reason to blow all of this out of proportion. People don't really care that Nestle is using a (very, very) small amount of California's water. They just want to see a big corporation punished.

If they're seeking justice, they should be directing that anger at the Ag industry. Articles like this are a smokescreen.
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/21/us/your-contribution-to-the-california-drought.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0

Shipping water bottles out of California is a nothingth of a nothingth of the problem, it's not even worth talking about.
How can they be "literally" stealing it when they are paying for it and following all guidelines?! 
I read that the water produced at this plant STAYS in California.  It is NOT shipped to other states.
Plastic water bottles are among the most successful recycling category in the US. Also the larger ones that you put on the dispenser are re-usable.
This is a different topic than the crisis of water shortage in California. The ethics involved with bottling water is a separate issue. I think people are having a tough time separating the goal of reducing water usage with their personal beliefs around bottled water. The two need to be debated separately to ensure an objective outcome (obviously they can be related). The fundamental point is that for the current problem - over usage of water I'm California - removing bottled water fr the equation hardly helps. 
I'm not so sure about that. There seems to be a bottling plant in every city. They are most likely bottling locally to save on transport cost and then selling it regionally.
Dude I think you're underestimating how much it costs to ship stuff as heavy as water 
And never forget you and I are part of the mob and the majority. This discussion is the majority, and it doesn't seem all that ignorant.
nobody really asks where Nestle is selling that water. However, either way we already know the impact on total water supply is very low, compared to agriculture 
I am completely ignorant in the economic matters of California, so I would like to ask you a few questions that may help me understand the current situation:

What portion does agriculture contribute to the economical standing of California?  How much would it be impacted by reducing wateruse by 1%?  How many of the agriculture farms are independently owned?  How would the 1% decrease across the board impact independently owned farmers vs commercial farmers?

In the opposite end, how much does Nestle contribute to the economical standing of California?
Agreed, those are luxuries we should examine and problems we should fix. Doesn't make nestle not a problem.

>At the end of the day, the agriculture industry reducing it's water usage by 1% would reduce consumption more than Nestl√© shutting down completely in California.

Source please.. and thank you sir.
Please re-read the sentence that I wrote which immediately followed:
>"But nestle's bottling is only a drop in the bucket!" In hard times, I thought every drop counted. 
People can do both at the same time. It's not an either or situation.

The fact is, shutting down a bottling plant is quick and easy. Fixing farm consumption of water is complicated and takes time. You can't just turn off farms. They provide the food you eat. You would need the supply chains and farms elsewhere to pickup the slack immediately. Curtailing their water usage also isn't that easy. It requires investments into technology, or even just pure man hours and knowledge.
It is also hard to argue against the guy making the food you eat. 
Agreed, let's some arguing about it and shut em down. They broke the law, it's bad water policy to let them continue, bam, shut em down and move on to the big fish with one success under our belts.
This is Orwellian double speak.  Every little bit counts.  

Selling water from a drought-stricken state makes no sense, and Nestle should voluntarily be rethinking their business model.  

If the state expends resources fining people for exceeding their quotas, they can expend resources to pursue this issue too.

And I am *so sick* of the "emotion" argument.  Downvote just for that alone.
And you know what? I agree with you, too. The agricultural industry should cut back on water usage. Doing so would save a lot of water, more than cutting back in the bottling industry.

Some people have it in their head that my thinking the bottlers should conserve means that I think the farmers shouldn't, and that's just not true. Everybody should be cutting back, including the farms, the bottlers, and the citizens. 
[deleted]
My argument isn't against vending machines. It's against keeping production of a luxury good running at a time when luxuries should be cut back. I'm not saying people shouldn't drink, I'm saying people and businesses should exercise restraint in a time where a valuable resource is running scarce.

And again I'd like to reiterate, I am NOT saying that the agriculture industry is blameless. 
> What's your argument against water in vending machines? 

The problem is that they're selling the water _outside of California_.  They could easily use water from other places and sell it **in** California, but they're choosing the do the opposite. 

Sucking CA water out of the ground for nearly nothing, then selling it out of state at a huge markup, for no real reason. 
How about "let's look at *all* the ways we can conserve?  How about that?
Water rights are water rights. Change the rules, in the meantime they can't snap their fingers and change their methods. Midway through a season at that.
we don't take 80% of the water, we take 40% and considering that we feed a large portion of the world I wouldn't be complaining too much
Why don't people just get together and start a non-profit water bottling company in California? It could run mostly on donations and sell water at an extremely low price while still gaining a slight profit so it doesn't sink
Bottled water is not even sold at an enormous profit. If you buy a coca cola, it costs the same, because the syrup and carbonation only costs about 2 cents to produce. Shipping liquids is extremely expensive, which is why dehydrated and concentrated drinks cost a fraction of their liquid forms.
Switching to drip irrigation isn't just to save water, it also increases yields, making it a long-term investment that is both better for long-term profit margins and environmental impact. 
Which, if the drought started this year would be an argument. Since it's been going for years, is in fact something one can expect to reoccur it seems they could in fact have done something by now.
SoCal often has droughts. It was always clear that the mass planting of water hungry crops wouldn't work in the long term. 
People who bought homes in California do not have time machines either. Should homeowners be compensated for the premium they placed on purchasing  a home with a yard or a shower given that they are currently unable to fully utilize them? Agriculture is all insurable at heavy subsidies by the federal government. If a farmer cannot plan to occasionally lose some of their crops to a drought in a desert then they deserve to go out of business. At the very least they could install drip irrigation within the season if their crops were truly so important to the economy.

But whatever. brb. I'm going to go do a rain dance so that people can procrastinate reforming 100 year old water right legislation.
Okay so we should encourage wasteful practices? Fucking oil rig blows, eh the ocean will go back to normal eventually. We deforest the Amazon, eh trees will grow back. We hunt a species to oblivion, I'm sure tigers and rhinos will just magically come back. 

Your argument is the epitome of arrogance. 

There were no incentives to use water properly, and indeed there were incentives to waste it. California ag procedures mimicked that of government run organization in that their need of resource was calculated from how much they use. That all fine and good until it encourages wasteful practices. I'm trying to solve the real issue, not blame nestle. That's just fucking dumb. 
Classic alarmists looking for a scapegoat that they already don't like. It's so easy and convenient to hate Nestl√© and Wal-Mart because corporations.
> They didn't know a drought would happen. There was always enough water,

The problem is Ag is a pretty small part of the overall CA economy.  How fair is it to ask people not to flush their toilets in order to benefit a handful of rich farmers when those people probably work in the Film or Tech industries and each bring in hundreds of thousands or millions in economic benefits per year? 
Not necessarily, farmers buy water insanely cheap and they don't always use the best irrigation methods. Even if they only waste .5% of the total water they use for the season, it really adds up. Especially when you apply that to every single farm.  
And aside from efficiency, the types of crops they grow can be really water-intensive, which we should work hard to limit (why are we growing rice in CA?).
The global average water footprint of 1 lb. of beef = 1,799 gallons water

Yeah but you can buy food from other parts of the country, where they have more water. You don't _need_ to grow food in CA in order to eat in CA.
This is a goddamn lie and you know it.

Farmers are either huge corporations or extremely rich individuals.

How many times do we have to keep debunking the big ag lies?

Oh, and California is only responsible for 8% America's "food"
Insurance is massively subsidized by the federal government for essentially all agricultural products, including those associated with California.
Water can still cost the same net amount for farmers if they use less of it but use it more intelligently. Drip irrigation would not only decrease water usage but would also increase yields of food, making less water = more food. You can make the water more expensive to encourage farmers to switch to drip irrigation, in the long term making food cheaper.
Funny thing is, the subsidies are specifically allocated for foods that we do not need. The ones we do need are largely unsubsidized.
Tried and true? It costs tons to create and maintain and would account for barely a trickle. 
Let's start with the guys using trillions of gallons, if we need more, than we'll go after the guys using a couple thousand gallons 
If they source their water in California, they need to either find another source or shut down operations.  Residents are already being discouraged from using water for lawns or swimming pools.  Golf courses as they are remain impractical in a drought.

Any more questions?
You've got quite the brigade backing you up.  This was in the positives last I looked at it.  Interesting...

Anyway, exporting water from a drought-ridden area is NOT reasonable use.  They're not even using a proper permit.  If you think it's so reasonable, invite Nestle to use *your* water as a source.

It's not a side swipe at Chinese. What's with you?

An export goes to other countries. China is one of these countries. Exports of limited resources are not a good thing, because they put us at risk. Alfalfa is grown with intensive use of a limited resource. Exporting alfalfa to the Chinese (residents of China) hurts the US because it is grown using limited resources and these resources aren't being used by the people in the affected area. Because of this, the resources are not returned to their natural environment.
Why would 50/50 be a normal ratio?
[Simple answer]( http://imgur.com/cFXGi6U)
Yeah, that 40% that goes to the environment isn't used, but nice try.

You're like a talking point billboard and every single point has already been refuted

California agriculture is almost entirely of luxury items, it only supplies the USA with 8% of it's food, it makes up only 4% California's economy 

As for jobs, big ag is the number one user of migrant labor and pays them shit.
You can support agriculture's migration to a new form of water distribution for their crops. Instead of mass dumping water on their crops like it's the 1900's farmers can spend a little bit of their savings from their cheap subsidized water on drip irrigation, decreasing water usage dramatically and increasing yields.
> and 40% goes to ag which FEEDS YOU and 20%

NEWSFLASH: **YOU CAN GROW FOOD IN OTHER STATES.**

Seriously, this argument is idiotic. Grow food where the water is. How hard is that?

What stats?  Every stat I've seen says beef takes more water pound for pound then any other primary food item.
[deleted]
I'd love to see the stats you're going off of. Everything i've seen suggests differently. 
Do they have nipples?

You can milk anything with nipples.
Never tried it. Where do they sell it
First you soak the almonds for several hours in water, then you blend them  into a fine paste, then you squeeze the paste through a fine mesh like cheese cloth or even a kitchen towel, but they sell special nut milk sacks that work very well. The result is delicious almond milk!
The bottled water companies aren't saints but they aren't outdoors, either. They bottle water in California because people there buy it. It's expensive to ship water so they want to bottle it close to where demand is.If Californians stopped biting bottled water, nestle would close up shop pretty much instantly.
They don't believe water is a human right.  In other words, if they could, they would bottle up all available water and sell it.  No more free water for washing dishes, showers, or flushing the toilet.  It all comes from Nestle now.  Don't like Nestle?  Well then, we just won't sell you water.  Have fun dying of thirst.
not all crops or soil types can use drip irrigation, and most people that can do use drip already.  In some cases flood or regular sprinkler irrigation is more efficient than drip/micro especially depending on crop and soil type.  the Ag industry is well aware of the water shortage and water costs have risen greatly for us, we use what is most efficient for our crops
[deleted]
That's a vague and unconvincing argument. Here's a better one:

The amount of rainwater you can collect if strictly limited by the borders of your property. You have the right and should have the right to collect rain falling on your property, after all this is not much different from your lawn or your crop being watered by rainwater. When you take water from the ground, water from neighboring properties will flow in to fill to fill the hole and you could drain an entire area just from your property. Therefore, it's not as logical to give rights to extract water from the ground on your property.

At $9 a pound? Yes. A pound of corn costs 19 cents.
Each almond cost 1 gallon of water to grow. 
Yes? That you have to ask the question shows how out of touch many Americans are regarding their luxuries.
It goes to the Coca Cola plant.
It used to be shithouse!
I can argue with that 100%. >.>
Yes but it's not really going anywhere that's in any real need for imported tap water.
What if a municipality took over bottling it, though? Part of the issue here is the gigantic mark up for profits bottling companies make. If it was done by the local government, they could just mark up enough to cover their operating costs and that would ensure it got used locally as drinking water.
Dude. Gonna have to try harder.

They use far less than one percent. 0.008 percent. That's virtually nothing and is all for human consumption. And the bulk of the product stays in California or states close by, otherwise, they'd lose any profit in transportation costs. This is a pointless argument with zero foundation in reality. 
Actually,  California did outlaw fireplaces....
Doesn't matter. It adds up.

The way I see it is that it's mostly symbolic of the water issues in the state (no oversite or rational water policy), and at this point they've been screwing california by not obtaining the proper permits FOR YEARS and are shipping water out of a region that cannot afford to do so. Sure, the amount is small, but i think they should be made example of and we have a golden opportunity to take down one problem, since they've been caught red handed. Close em down. 

It's because people view agriculture as a more important business venture than exporting tap water.
In a drought ravaged state, business should not be able to withdraw water without oversight.

Everything helps.
I don't know the answers to your questions either. I'm not a California resident - I just don't like it when people jump on a crusade without researching all the facts. People have pointed out that there's a craft brewery in California that uses more water than Nestl√© does, but nobody's talking about that. Every single factory (I've worked in several) uses boatloads of water for all sorts of industrial processes. Some places even use evaporative coolers as part of their HVAC systems. At the end of the day, talking about one companies operations is not the answer here - I guess that was my point. 
I can't readily find it, but I'm  pretty sure I read they use 0.2 (or was it 0.02) percent of the Sacramento municipal water, and pay full rate. [Here's an article](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/15/californians-pressure-retail-giants-to-stop-bottling-water-during-drought.html) that says it's 0.008% of the state's water. Agriculture is reported to use 80%, so 10,000x as much. The numbers work out for what OP said. I personally think that since it's a scarce resource it's a bit nuts to be shipping it out of state, but they are a small player in a big problem.
And all the people working for that plant? I guess we just treat them as collateral? What about golf courses.. They use more water than a bottling plant. I'm assuming you want them closed immediately as well? You also act as if calorifornia isnt capable of getting food from other states. Will the cost go up? Of course. But thats the price to live in such a desirable area. 

I think there is a completely different debate here about the ethics of bottling water and specifically in drought ridden areas. However I think regardless of the conclusion of that discussion the result will have no measurable impact on the current crisis in calorifornia (math). Thus I'd rather we discuss solutions to this problem instead of using it as a guise to push an alternative agenda(ethics of water plants).
Not sure you know what doublespeak is. This isn't anything but sound engineering. You don't attack the small issues when there are larger ones still unaddressed. Its just a waste of time and money. Sorry if that doesnt fit your narrative. I dont use bottle water nor am I huge fan of its existence.. Yet math tells me shutting down bottled water in California will do nothing to help the drought. 
No, that's just not a good solution. The quality of life for the average person is reduced by much more if we cut back on small users like drinking water, showers and bottled drinks, compared to cutting back on wasteful stuff like golf courses and agriculture.
I know.. they're a staple for me because I don't eat a lot of meat and am allergic to most nuts.  I know they're a staple for a lot of people in my situation (and those who aren't).  Also, they bring a LOT of money back to the state and to the country.
Again. Luxery goods would include wine, beer, almonds, etc. I'd imagine if you looked at their water usage you would see as much or more than bottled water. At this point you keep moving the goal post so you dont have to admit you are wrong. Shutting down botteled water does nothing to help fix California's water issues. Much like taking a single cup of water from a bathtub will make no noticeable impact on the level. Its a fruitless waste of time and is only delaying a real fix. Your effort and ambition about this issue could be better utilized focused on something that will help the situation instead of wasting it on a inane goal
Of course you want to look at all the ways and create a matrix. Using CTQs you can then decide which of the ideas you should tackle. I think the point you are missing is that bottled water is not high on that list. The idea that we can do everything is so naive. 
Actually,  they could.

Especially considering these rights date back hundreds of years and were expected to continue for eternity.

Now you find me a legal contract that runs for eternity
You take 80% and you don't feed shit.

California crops are almost totally luxury items, the largest being alfalfa, which most is sent overseas for fucking camels and horses, and almonds,  which nobody's life has ever depended on.

 it's responsible for only 8% of us food and is less than 4% California's economy
That's called your utility company.

At least if it was free of corruption it would be.

California law says utilities cannot charge you more than the cost to bring the water in
Exactly how much profit do you think Nestle are making on bottled water? It's not like there's a monopoly, if it was possible to produce and sell bottled water cheaper while still making a profit, other companies would already be doing it.
Ok well even if the profit isn't *enormous* the rest my my statement holds true.
Which big ag won't cut into their profits to do.

Why should they? They own the politicians. They make billions a year. Why stop?
Ok so they can snap their fingers and make that happen? 

Would you do that? Would you spend lots of extra money and cut your profits even though you have water rights? No you wouldn't
Once it starts raining again no one will care and everything will go back to how it was and people will start bitching again in another 15-20 years when another drought happens
(California isn't a desert.  Only the very southern part is, and nobody grows anything there)
Then they should be protesting the people building homes in California.
Is that what I said?

You are crazy and can't understand simple concepts. Its not magic
Because they have the rights.

Change the law, don't blame the farmers. They are doing exactly what you would do.

while we could stand to consume less beef, the coffee value stands out to me far more. at least beef has nutritional value, coffee is almost entirely for pleasure or convenience. how about we cut back on our coffee intake.
Except that the cow drank that water out of a pond and the grass it ate was irrigated by rain.  The water is not destroyed,  it evaporates and returns as rain.
If we shot every cow in America, not one drop of water would be saved.

This is like arguing how many millions of gallons of water are necessary to float a sailboat.

its easier to try and make people aware of this and convince everyone to stop (or reduce) their beef consumption. if demand falls, supply will too. if demand remains the same, nothing will change

Need a source on that.  Regardless crop insurance is a necessity to keep farms afloat during years where your crops aren't doing well i.e. drought.  If you didn't have crop insurance you could very well go bankrupt after one or two seasons and then you're screwed
The problem is that not a lot of farmers are able to just switch over their production methods like that.  Sure, it would save them water and money in the long run, but it's an expensive investment right off the bat.  The only ones who will be able to afford it are the gigantic corporation farms, leaving the smaller family-run co-op farms fucked and out of business.  I work farmer's markets every summer and it's extremely depressing to see fewer and fewer farmers - that I've become friends with throughout the years - able to afford to grow food.  And then because they can't grow food, they can't sell it, so they have an even harder time affording that better irrigation system.

Maybe everyone should have implemented it 10 years ago.  But 10 years ago, there was so much water the state had no idea what to do with it and this was never forseen as a problem.  People are losing the farms they've had for generations and thousands of workers are being put out of business.  It really sucks and has nothing to do with "intelligence".
water costs have already risen incredibly and people are making switches to other micro irrigation if they can but micro systems aren't always the most efficient for certain crops and soil types, if farmers can save money on water they will switch and have but drip/micro isn't always the best form
This!

Desalinization is horrendously expensive.
Not only that but it consumes vast amounts of power to achieve.
Golf courses use as much per course as a water bottling plant. There are over 1000 golf courses in California, how many water bottling plants are there?

Also where exactly are you getting your trillion of gallons from? Total bottled water sold in the US is around 10 billion gallons per year, across all states and across every single bottled water company, which includes both foreign and domestic companies.
Yeah, what are you going to do if all those billions and billions of dollars of tax earners and job creators leave California because of the legislation you want to foist off on them?

Also importing water is actually far worse for the environment as even supposing all these companies stick around they would have to be importing billions of gallons of water, hauled by massive diesel trucks.

No, you can cry all you want but shaking your finger at Nestle as some evil entity making poor people die of dehydration, which isn't actually happening, will do absolutely nothing.

If you want to do something productive than campaign for increased funding for Water Desalinization, as that is an actual solution to the problem that wouldn't absolutely collapse California's economy.
Somewhat silly way to judge the value of food products. Any trip around america would convince you that farmers do not need to be maximizing the calories produced. They should instead generally focus on maximizing economic activity per gallon of water used. If luxury products generate a ton of income for farmers then they should still grow them and California can just import basic grains and vegetables from other states.
Ah so when the agri industry say they like things green they are actually referring to a nice stack of Benjamins.
Would it be possible to get sources on those stats?

It would help with telling people why I'm not gonna start taking shorter showers.
I do support efficient water use as does every other farmer, the fact is though drip doesn't work for all crops and isn't necessarily the most efficient or even water saving.  
Nice try with that completely irrelevant link. You're clearly a child who doesn't understand that there are people studying agriculture as a science, and they work for "big ag" feeding the planet the most efficient way possible.

Edit: he ninja-edited out the most hostile part of his comment, common troll tactic.

Nestl√© has 7 water brands in the US, representing 7 (more or less) different bottling locations (although, I think Pure Life is exclusively from Ontario and BC).  Like you said, this is so they don't have to waste money shipping heavy water across the continent.      
       
Arrowhead, the water bottled in California is sold only to the west coast.  Some goes to Arizona, some goes to the north west, but you know the vast majority is consumed by people in California.      
        
Look, I'm no fan of Nestl√©,  but that doesn't mean they should be used as a scapegoat when, for once, they haven't really done anything wrong
Where exactly do you see them doing any of that?

Besides what exactly do you mean when you say water is a human right? Do you mean that you shouldn't be able to bottle it and sell it? Then of course Nestle is going to deny that, just like a farmer would say that food isn't a human right because he wants to sell his crops.
Easy and real solution would still be reducing the water agriculture gets. If the farmers can't use efficient irrigation methods for their crop, they could start producing more efficient crops. It would cause the price of some produces to increase obviously, but that's a small issue compared to what the current water usage will cause in the long term.
And yet the Japanese have done it
If you don't include the water involved in making the bottle, [it takes 1.39 liters of water to fill a 1 liter bottle](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/10/28/241419373/how-much-water-actually-goes-into-making-a-bottle-of-water). Because you have to produce the bottle itself, total water footprint of bottled water is almost certainly much higher than for tap water. But if the bottles are produced elsewhere, it is possible for the local water footprint to be lower using bottles. I don't know if the bottles are produced in California, but that's not the issue here, the bottling of the water itself is what people are so up in arms about.

Or why not sell some of it to people who live out of state, providing an income flow and employing thousands of Californians? Wait... that's what you're doing.
Or, why doesn't somebody start bottling water and selling it at half the price?

If its such a disgusting markup, than somebody stands to make great profit who starts bottling water and selling it for $0.25-$0.50.

People complain about prices being too high.  Instead of complaining look at it as an opportunity to get rich.  I guess its easier to blame corporations than start one and employ people themselves.

California resident here. Something which is often ignored, and the real reason many are mad at Nestle, is the fact that their water permit expired a while ago and yet they continue to pump.

Gov't - "Your permit is expired"

Nestle - "We're a big corporation lol buy our bottles"

They're not even paying for the water they're pumping and selling back. No one has the guts to forcibly run them out.  See the signs saying "Stop stealing our water"? That isn't hyperbole. They're pumping state water on an *expired permit* and selling it commercially. It's theft in any scenario, but with the drought right now it's a big (if symbolic in the larger picture) slap in the face. Most articles don't mention the permit thing even though the protesters all know about it, I can only assume it's because Nestle sinks a lot of money into its PR department.

Everyone who doesn't live here needs to tone down the armchair commentary before they have all the facts.
You're throwing out a lot of strawman arguments here. Some people are going to lose jobs, yes, but it's far better that way than having the water crisis multiply here. Kill One Save One-Thousand mentality here.

Also, golf courses using up too much water? Fuck yea, let's close them up too. That's *also* a luxury that people shouldn't be worrying about at this point.

The WHOLE issue here is that California is in a **SEVERE** drought. As in, if this keeps going on, they **WILL HAVE NO WATER PERIOD** in the matter of a couple of years.

Even if it's only a small change, it's at least a small change in the right direction. We shouldn't be losing sight on ALL things that we could be doing to help, which is what people are doing here. Rather than focusing on ALL ways we could be helping the water issue, everyone is trying to focus solely on the "worst" cases of it. That's fucking stupid, since the "worst cases" are ones that are the least likely to budge at this point.

Keep working at them, but by all means, take down other problem issues while you're at it!

Am I in that position? No. Does that make valuing profits over the water table's long term security right? I can't answer that question for the farmers. It is my opinion that if water rights were cut farmers would move to more sustainable water use methods.

> Change the law, don't blame the farmers. They are doing exactly what you would do. 

That's not how politics works.  You have two sides - farmers and people who want to be able to flush their shit like a normal human. Farmers pay far less for water then residential properties, and they think it's unfair. 

That's going to piss anyone off. The fact that farmers are acting in their best interest doesn't mean people aren't going to get mad at them. 
1) I'm not saying stop farming.  
2) We shouldn't grow rice here at all. Nobody even purchases it with the exception of Japan (because of some trade agreement) which they use to feed their animals with.  
3) I'd rather farmers use a system that is more failure-prone if it means there is still water for them to use.  
4) We can reduce the amount of almonds, grapes, etc. grown here. It would cause some pricing to go up in the markets, but again, we would still have water.  
5) We should really reduce the amount of animals we grow in this state. Why not let Texas raise all the cattle?  
  
6) There is the giant Keystone XL pipeline that pumps oil thousands of miles at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gallons per day. Why can't we build one that from midwest/eastern US to CA to do the same for water? It would have a faster rate since water is less viscous.  
  
7) Assuming #6 can't work, why not build large desalinization plants powered by solar/nuclear, and recycle the particulates into sea-salt, and other things? (Even if there is some indisposable wastes, it's better than not having any water).
How about you stop irrigating animal feed, that seems like a step in the right direction. From UC Davis - https://imgur.com/eNXiCzm
The global footprints are a red herring because the vast majority of that water comes from places where there is no shortage. If there is a shortage of water in California we need to look at what the water taken from California is used for, not at how much water is used at coffee farms in tropical countries or to transport the products to the consumer.
You do realize most coffee is grown in tropical climates where it rains almost every day.  
The reason they use so much is that there is no shortage and no reason to conserve.
"the grass it ate was irrigated by rain"

Most cattle doesn't live on a mom-and-pop ranch, eating grass all day. Most of them eat corn, soy, and maybe some grain. This is all irrigated by machines and pumps, not rain.

Yeah also water cycles aren't as simple as you're saying they are. If that was how it worked, then why is California in a drought? Where did the water from the past few years of farming go? Look up the high-pressure ridge in the pacific.
Or, we could stop subsidizing it at every step of the process, and let the free market take care of it.
The lie is saying farmers don't make money http://www.city-data.com/forum/california/1369366-already-americas-top-agriculture-state-ca.html

Or that people will go hungry if California stopped farming
Crop insurance is a necessity. The federal government paying for up to 2/3 of the cost out of pocket is not. Farmers would pay higher amounts insurance if the feds were not subsidizing it.
And all for not that much water.

Right, it doesn't seem on work on most of the alfalfa, which has a evapotranspiration rate of between 3.6 and 5.5 acre feet in California.

From "the irrelevant link"

*"this system has already shown significant advantages over outdoor farms since coming online earlier this year: Produce waste has been cut from 50 percent of a harvest to just 10, productivity per square foot has increased 100 fold, and water usage has been slashed to just 1 percent of what a conventional farm would consume."* 

I don't think anything else need said
Agriculture companies would finally spend money on drip irrigation to reduce their water usage, and would be more inclined to look at the long-term benefits of such a system: higher yields and lower water usage and environmental impact.
which feeds people in other countries, that's my issue with people saying we need to stop ag in CA, if you cut out all these products there's going to be massive impact across the globe
That less then a 5% difference but almonds have 230% the calories that beef does. 

Edit: Additionally, you call it double dipping but stats that don't include how much water it takes to grow the food it takes to grow a lbs of beef is seems to make for a pretty irrelevant comparison.

[This]( http://www.amazon.com/Flax-USA-Inc-Flaxmilk-Unsweetened/dp/B008R2VF02 ) all could find in the U.S.
Tons of uses for [almond meal.](http://allrecipes.com/recipes/ingredients/baking-ingredients/flours/almond-meal/)
Well, for starters, the CEO said he would bottle more from California if he could.  Just what they need, right?  more water going out of their state.

Frankly, I don't care if Nestle sells water.  They just shouldn't sell it from places that don't have very much of it.
http://modernsurvivalblog.com/preps/how-long-can-you-store-water-in-plastic-containers/
> I guess its easier to blame corporations than start one and employ people themselves. 

Would you be against community-funded bottling? 
I wouldn't have a problem with that either, but seriously, have you examined the tax code lately and compared what it's like for small businesses vs giant corporations? The code is unduly complicated, and while Nestle can afford to pay a bunch of lawyers and tax guys to comb through it and find all the best loopholes, small business owners don't have the luxury of those types of resources. Then look at how big corporations sit on all sorts of regulatory boards in government, in direct conflict of interest, and an industry essentially gets to write it's own regulations and have it rubberstamped by Congress and congressional committees. Small businesses don't have the lobbyists to accomplish that.

You unfettered capitalism guys always champion the small business owner and bring them up as an excuse to never regulate and never raise taxes. But the truth is, you aren't concerned about the impact on small business, or you have been sorely mislead. It's about maintaining the status quo for big business.

I'm all for a level playing field and encouraging small business growth. Maybe we should stop giving corporations so many tax breaks and exploitable loopholes that they end up paying NEGATIVE taxes ( ie they get a taxpayer funded REFUND) and maybe give more breaks and subsidies to the little guy for a change. I would rather subsidize a small business with less than 50 employees by giving tax breaks that can only be achieved by paying your workers higher wages, than I would give big oil or the corn industry taxpayer subsidy money when they are already behemoths.
Jesus you guys are dense.

PS: You shouldn't kill bees. You probably meant wasps.

So once again, the devil
And yet. Here we are with big ag demanding the same.
They can plant the figs, citrus and dates they they were growing before they ripped it up for unsustainable cash crops. Their profits should not be protected because they made a bad choice which has now impacted everyone else.
Yes, it's called I snap my fingers and pay someone to put it together.

Something big ag could do but won't unless someone else pays for it

And with the bribes..er.. campaign contributions they give, I'm betting they'll get us to pay for it while they suck up all the profit. You know, like what's going on now.
I buy local here in Oregon so I don't care. You guys in Cali are really nuts you know that? If you stopped letting people screw you over and starting taking action locally you wouldn't have to deal with this bullshit. Also, make some damn solar powered desalination plants already because this drought is only the start. It will be worse in the upcoming years and you will get more fires too, only worse. Just saying what the science foretold through real data years ago. But I guess TV shows and focusing on making money really distracted you guys too much to make any good decisions together.
*Sigh*

Lets see your source, because I tire of debunking this
They probably would.

In the meantime they can't fucking snap their fingers and move to a drop method willy nilly halfway through a season. 

Its not fucking magic. 

Make your PC water cooled. RIGHT NOW. Snap your fingers and make it happen. Now make it happen to every PC in the state. 

I am waiting. 

Don't blame the farmers. Blame the state government
People flush their shit 

Do you even live in California
How do you start growing less almonds, grapes (which aren't even water intensive), and other crops?  The government can't just be like "yo you can't farm anymore" there isn't the precedent for that and the companies will sue for damages in that case. 

 The pipeline won't because there's no profit in it and it requires a LOT of energy to pump water a distance that long and you wouldn't be able to do it in a large enough quantity to make a difference and the other states control their water sources and don't want it to be shipped to us.  

There are several desalinization plants being built but they are very inefficient and don't come close to meeting any sort of urban water demand and there is a huge amount of minerals leftover from desalinating it that we don't know what to do with.  Also more likely than not by the time the plants are done the drought will have lifted.  They are a nice backup to have but they won't do much to alleviate water demand.  

One of the biggest problems is that 80% of rainfall happens in the northern part of the state while the majority of the state population lives in socal where it's literally a desert.  Most ag is in the northern sections where they do receive good rainfall (in normal years) during winter then irrigate over summer since we don't get summer rain.  Honestly it's a clusterfuck and there isn't a simple solution.
[deleted]
Maybe in California.  

In Georgia, they either graze or eat hay until right before slaughter when they are fed grain to fatten them up and to make the meat taste better.

The point is that beef is not the problem.  The problem is a local one.  If the government would just get out of the way,  the alfalfa farmers in California would have to pay the same rate for water as everyone else and they would not irrigate.  Without cheap alfalfa and water,  the ranchers would sell their herds to ranchers in states with abundant water and start producing something else.  
[deleted]
Revenue isn't the same as profit. The article points out that while Dairy farmers had $5b in revenue (a 31% increase), they still failed to turn a profit (due to higher input costs). Probably explains the down votes. 
He wanted the source on the bottled water, not almonds.
Nestle does give a chunk of their profits to California, it is called taxes.

Also how exactly is it your water again? Because either they are pumping it from their wells, which they have private rights too, or they are getting it from the tap like everyone else which means they are paying for it like everyone else is.

If you want to point the finger and say they are using too much then there are far better targets, as has been pointed out numerous times. Most notably the Agriculture industry, which uses 80% of the water in California, or even Golf courses which use about as much per average sized course as a water bottling plant.

Or how about Beer? Between most beer companies use about 10 gallons of water to make one gallon of beer. Nevermind the water being "wasted" on growing the hops and barley and other ingredients that go into beer.

No, Nestle is just the scape goat being thrown out to the braying crowd out for blood. 
How about....all of them? Have you ever written an MLA format paper? You cite *all* your sources not just some.
I totally forgot how dumb the average reddit user was. Thanks for reminding me.
It is not exclusive to CA.
The alfalfa feeds horses and camels, and nobody is living on almonds. And even then, that's our water being subsidized and we're being taxed, so they can make a profit. 

Fuck. That.

Try again, or don't, you're embarrassing yourself. 
The water for the food for cattle has already been used to grow the food, so unless you can put the water back, yeah, it's completely fair.

Unless you want to use the water for the almond trees that gave the seeds to make new almond trees, that made new almond trees, we can do that if you like.

That's the fun thing about livestock vs crops, livestock only goes back one or two generations at most. Crops go back dozens.

As for nutrition,  irrelevant,  we're talking water use, not nutritional value. Another almond lobby talking point
Oh I see, left wing bad, right wing good?

Unless it doesn't go with what you want, then right wing bad, left wing good

Sorry you don't like the medium but the data is without question.
Too much propaganda going around, most sources will double dip numbers
Check *all* the grocery stores in your area. One of them has to have at least one brand.
Do people actually store water for longer than 6 months? How long can you even store water before the bacteria grows to unsafe levels?

Also, you shouldn't store anything in sunlight. That should be common knowledge. Plastics, paints, etc. will get damaged and the temperature increases which produces better habitat for bacteria growth.
yes what the fuck.  I dont drink bottled water I drink from my faucet.  

Why is everybody so socialist?  Why must everything including freakin BOTTLED WATER have to be some sort of societal effort. I want nothing to do with you people. Don't make me fund some horribly managed municipal water-bottle plant.  

All the people that think its a good idea, should group together and invest in it.  No need to drag the whole community into it.  

No individualism left in this country.

Also, isn't california a bunch of environment hippies?  HOW DO THEY EVEN ALLOW BOTTLED WATER THERE?  So wasteful, plastic is not biodegradable and harmful to the environment

The Taliban started off as a home owners association.
It has impacted anyone else though. It may..but at this point the statement you just said is untrue. 

They have water rights. They are doing EXACTLY what you and everyone else in this thread would do. 
In the middle of a season? 

You realize its not fucking magic dude. Do you even know what it would entail? Regardless guess what? They don't have time machines they didn't know there would be a drought. This will go away and everything will go back to normal. 

You are weird.
We should be making more nuclear plants to power the desalinization plants tbh. Also, we need to do a better job of regulating Ag. We should limit the acreage of water-intensive crops, completely removing ones like rice (which doesn't make sense to grow in CA).
Desalination can't be run on solar power, it's not a large enough baseline power. We need cold fusion or nuclear for it to make sense. 
Our politicians are bought and sold.

Unless we pass a proposition,  nothing gets done
>ÔøºCalifornia produces a sizable majority of many American fruits, vegetables, and nuts, including 99 percent of artichokes


>**California produces a sizable majority of many American fruits, vegetables, and nuts: 99 percent of artichokes, 99 percent of walnuts, 97 percent of kiwis, 97 percent of plums, 95 percent of celery, 95 percent of garlic, 89 percent of cauliflower, 71 percent of spinach, and 69 percent of carrots (and the¬†list¬†goes on and on).** Some of this is due to climate and soil. No other state, or even a combination of states, can match California‚Äôs output per acre. Lemon¬†yields in California, for example, are more than 50 percent higherthan in Arizona. California spinach yield per acre is¬†60 percent higher¬†than the national average. Without California, supply of all these products in the United States and abroad would dip, and in the first few years, a few might be nearly impossible to find. Orchard-based products in particular, such as nuts and some fruits, would take many years to spring back.


It's so simple, we grow all the food because it's the best place to grow and if we removed the crops it would take decades to start growing them elsewhere. It's not an option economically. 


I didn't say they should switch in the middle of the season. I'm not just looking at this drought, I'm looking at the long term for California. For the short term I think the only thing we can do is limit our personal water use and hope this fixes itself by next season. I think it would be a great idea for people to start pushing for the state government to cut water rights for later seasons though.
>How do you start...  

Tell the farms that beginning 2018 you will start handing out permits to grow each crop. There is a limited amount per county of permits for each crop. Using scientific, economic, and statistical analysis, calculate the max and min amount of each crop that can be grown that will both keep the price from raising too high while also not using too much water. (This number can be slowly raised/lowered per crop each year). Use these findings to set the limit per county.  
  
>The Pipeline won't...  
>There are several desalinization...  
  
Better to spend extra money or create some waste than be without water. We can't assume that the drought is just going to lift in a couple years, what if it lasts 5 more years? 10? 25? My main point is that we have to do *something*. We don't have time to twiddle our thumbs and say 'think of the farmers' or 'think of Nestle'. We have to do something immediately, because in 5 years when the drought doesn't lift, we're going to be screwed and it'll be far too late to start any projects that take years to build. Rather screw over a few farmers now if it means not screwing everyone over later.  
  
>One of...  
  
I know, I'm from a farming town NorCal, currently studying in SoCal.
> there is no shortage yet. in time things can very well change.

It's unlikely. Even the water we "waste" will circulate back into the environment, draining down into the ocean or the groundwater in some way before eventually evaporating and raining back down. What we do with the water when it's on its way from the clouds back to the ocean doesn't make a big difference.
So you're saying they'll be fine if they're charged more for the water they use. Cool. 
That and the big ag PR drones that haunt these threads

Considering the median income for farmers in California is $84,000,(not including subsidies)  I think they've doing pretty good http://work.chron.com/much-money-farmers-make-average-annually-3185.html
He asked where the trillions came from, I answered 
> Nestle does give a chunk of their profits to California, it is called taxes.

  Pretty sure thats called a kickback.  Very generous of them, to give a tiny pittance back of what they are taking for next to free.  

I'm not even sure I believe you when you say they pay anything at all, without some sort of source.  

I said nothing about beer, or the ag industry.  

I don't know enough about beer to have an opinion.
I have a serious problem with the ag industry for water wasting and exploitation, and I don't think screwing around with nestle is going to help the drought.

I think it'll put an end to an exploitative relationship, and because I have trouble understanding my reality (or seem to, as this is a belief nobody else seems to share) I don't really think we're going to stop exploiting the resources we've made scarce through greed and lack of forethought without also ceasing to exploit each other for the same reasons.

I just don't think we can care more about our planet than ourselves, crazy I know, but I think thats beyond us, so as best as I can tell, both nestle and ag's predatory practices (and quite possibly the beer industry, nothing is quite as ubiquitous as fucking over somebody else for our own gains it seems!) and the drought are part of a bigger problem quite likely to deliver larger problems than the drought itself in the future.
Time mostly is the issue

Especially when I post sources elsewhere on the same thread, it gets annoying having to repeat myself 
You're embarrassing yourself, did you know that alfalfa is grown in alternating years with other normal food crops because it fixes nitrogen in the ground?  The water subsidies we get are only to offset the cost of the land we use, here's an article explaining why cutting water subsidies is a bad idea and that the subsidies have actually increased water efficiency http://calwatchdog.com/2014/10/01/water-subsidies-are-ancient-history/
That doesn't actually tell people what foods they actually eat are costing the most water.  What you are trying to do obfuscates the issue for non ag industry people.
But propaganda can go both ways right? You'd have to imagine the lobbyists are in overdrive. But when it really boils down both Beef and Almonds take a lot of water to produce.
Yes, yes they do
 That's not what I or many would do. California has placed many restrictions on restrictions on people and businesses. This is no different. Their legislature can alter the water rights system if it wishes to.
It would mean they either pay for their water like everyone else and cut back like everyone else, or they can have it all die.

I'm good either way because California is only 8% America's food and less than 4% California's economy.

They could vanish tomorrow and nobody would notice or care outside those directly profiting 
I agree with some of that, just not the nuke plants. Solar runs Desal plants that provide for a whole island. Just look up Bonaire in the Caribbean.
You're an idiot. They already have plants that provide for whole islands that run on solar power. Just look up Bonaire.
It's the best place to grow if there's enough water. Doesn't seem to be the case right now.
Obviously not the best place grow when it never fucking rains. It's just a tradition that was built on cheap labor, maybe it shouldn't continue.
[deleted]
He asked where you got trillions of gallons from bottled water.
Obfuscation doesn't mean I use fuzzy math to push an agenda.

Here's the simple facts.

Fact is, California is in a water crisis. Its people are being punished because the government is bought off by big ag.  Big ag uses 80% of California's water, pays almost nothing for it, makes billions, yet only contributes 4% to the state economy and 8% to the US food supply.

In short, they are parasites leeching off us.
Fact is, we got 20, they got 80.

We're getting punished for using, they're expanding.

Everything else is just background noise
Is there common reason or is just for emergency reasons, like shelters? Water for far away locations without water connection?
I don't know who told you those stats but read [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/07/california_grows_all_of_our_fruits_and_vegetables_what_would_we_eat_without.html).  
There are plenty more [sources](http://www.beachcalifornia.com/california-food-facts.html) like it too.   

"California has been the number one food and agricultural producer in the United States for more than 50 consecutive years."  
  
CA grows insane amounts of food. What should be regulated is what/how much can be grown here. We should cut back on almonds as they require too much water. And we shouldn't be growing things like rice in this state.

...

It is their water, thats what the law says. Change the law. 

You wouldn't do anything different. 

It will rain again and no one will remember this drought.

Want to know how the drought affects me? Instead of click it or ticket signs on the freeway I see save water.

Thats it
Solar plants would be awesome, but I don't think the technology is there yet. Energy storage is still a huge issue, also solar wouldn't be too great up in northern  coastal CA where there is more overcast. Think of tech as an evolving creature, we started with coal, then we should move to nuclear, then solar. Back in the late 1900's people started getting scared of nuclear energy and we started downsizing. We should've been up-sizing while investing into renewable sources like solar/wind. By this time we would already be using solar.  
  
Problem is public ignorance mixed with oil company lobbying.
That's not California. The demand is so much higher. Our first desal plant just opened in San Diego. 
Not sure where you've been getting your info.

[The climate and soil plays a huge part.](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/07/california_grows_all_of_our_fruits_and_vegetables_what_would_we_eat_without.html) The yields in California are phenomenal - less land produces more food. It usually rains plenty in California, and it isn't just about rain, but the snow in the Sierra mountains that melts and provides water in the summer. In general we have a dry, hot summer season and a very wet, temperate winter/spring rainy season.

A big reason why the Central Valley is so fertile is [every 100-200 years](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atmospheric-rivers-california-megaflood-lessons-from-forgotten-catastrophe/) California will have massive floods that will wash nutrients into the central valley, as well as make it a giant lake. The sad thing is that we're paving one of the most [bountiful paradises on Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_%28California%29#Agriculture) when we should be living on the hills. Maybe the next time the central valley turns into an inland sea we'll rethink things collectively.
No our climate makes it the best place to grow. Piping in water into the desert is the most efficient form of farming and has been since ancient Egypt. You have full control trip over the crops and don't suffer huge losses due to weather. It also takes decades to get certain crops producing like almonds so if we stop there would be no almonds for a long time. 
The point is that the water you consume is only taken out of the equation for an inconsequential amount of time, compared to the thousands of years it spends in the groundwater/ocean.
I never said anything about bottled water

I said we should worry about guys using trillions of gallons first,  then if needed, the guys using a few thousand 
Where do you get the statistics saying that agriculture contributed 4% to the state economy? All of the GDP breakdowns I have found suggest that agriculture is less than 2%
Where to you find the numbers for % to state economy and % to US food supply? The numbers I've seen for the latter are much higher.
Who is we?
Buy in bulk, emergency, storage

This is assuming a company doesn't store it like this either
Good. I've read how Nestle will build these pump stations under the guise of it being a simple water well- then proceed to fill countless tanker trucks up and diminish entire water tables.  They pay $500 for a permit and make millions off of the bottled water.
"the decision will be appealed..."

*after nestles makes the adequate 'payroll increases' to the appropriate government personnel*
They really should focus on collecting spring water at the rate it naturally emerges, in whatever locations possible, not pumping out water that would otherwise remain underground. Unless the local community will be the ones who drink the water, or use it to irrigate their farmland, then there's no reason to grant approval. 
They are appealing to the State where their lobbyists can grease the reelection funds of the Reps that matter, in the hopes that permits are granted despite the resistance of the localities who's water they take. Sounds normal to anyone? 
Fuck nestle. And all their higher ups. With a handful of aids needles.
Yeah - nestle will sue the planning commission. 

Failing that, they will sue the members of the planning commission. 

They will push this until its no longer profitable for them to do so.
yea!, need to stymie these giant corporations at every turn until they pay their fair share of tax and take responsibility for their pollution
Seriously, bottled water?

Its only a tiny percentage of places across the US where you need to buy bottled water due to the quality of the local water.

Most people who buy bottled water do so because they have been easily manipulated by marketing companies to thinking that Bottled water is better than, um... water.

Of course, can't really rely on this new EPA, I'm sure soon enough the new EPA is going to push back on regulations and say there is no proof that lead in water is bad for you.
[deleted]
Nestle will get the water. They'll get it one way or another.
This a negotiating tactic. The commission is holding out for more money.
I'm more concerned by how they generally don't pay for it, bribe up politicians to cover up everything, then bill up people by the nose 
like ~~3$ for 1L~~ of water...

If they acted like a reasonable business tho, i guess it wouldn't come to that.

Edit : even up to 11$ per gallon sometimes. I'm not kidding : https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nestle-Pure-Life-Purified-Water-1-Gal/15161591
Until I read the comments, I thought they were trying to build a gas station.
How many jobs would the bottling plant create?  Is this part of a stressed aquifer?  
[removed]
> They pay $500 for a permit and make millions off of the bottled water.

I think the blame should be shared.  Nestle and stupid people who buy their bottled water.  A 24 pack of bottled water costs me $1.78.  A bottle of water at the local stop and rob is $1.75.
they used to steal it from Lake Michigan, treat it, and then sell it as bottled water. 
Springs are really, really rare.  They only form on the downhill side of a hill or mountain, and then only if there's a permeable layer of rock under an impermeable layer.  Basically all our drinking water comes from wells or reservoirs.   
I'd say that sounds fair.  The CEO of Nestle deserves to get a thousand injections into the inside of his asshole.
I have a well and live in a hurricane zone, so I buy bottled water for power outages.

I also buy bottles for their ease. I can keep a few in my car for when the kids are suddenly dying from thirst. Sure, I could fill my own bottles, but apparently I'm lazy and don't have enough forethought.
A lot is for export. In Asia the water is so bad you even have to brush your teeth with bottled water 
It is funny how many people forget that there a still a lot of people that live in rural areas that have wells. A in-house filtration system is the way to go, but for all of us who do not have one, many choose to buy bottled water to consume (be it in smaller bottles or gallon jugs).
My town in MS has old crappy pipes throughout leading to rust filled water. Town is too poor and doesn't care to do anything about it, so it's either filters or bottled water if you don't want a brownish-orange glass of water
That's funny because the first thing I thought was "I guess this means Flint Michigan still won't have clean water." 

That's OK, the EPA is doing an amazing job and there's dedicatedly no need for anything else in Flint. /S
some people buy bottled water for the bottle too
Lead builds character -Trump
Nestle is a bad company but get a better source for your news. Even the huff post has a better article one this. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-mcgraw/nestle-chairman-peter-brabeck-water_b_3150150.html rarely will I source huffpost but its way better then defenddemocracy in its fact checking.

"He also states that GMOs have never caused illnesses despite hundreds of independent studies showing otherwise."

No, not one peer reviewed study links gmos with any illness this reporter lies and talks out of his ass.
No, they want to build a re-lift station on a mainline from a little 400gpm well. I'm not convinced that anyone in these comments read the article. 
If they'd stop shipping water out of the watershed, your shilling for Nestle would have a point.  That isn't the case.
The fact Nestle says water isn't a human right and they should have the right to own natural water sources on public land tells me Nestle can fuck right off. 
[deleted]

Unrelated, but a 2liter of coke at Walmart is $.99. A 16oz coke out of the fridge at the walmart register is $1.49
I'm not sure of your point because Nestle probably bottled that case you bought. People should really not buy bottled water unless there is a need, not just for convenience.
Spend millions to convince consumers to buy bottled water, and you're more to blame than the consumers are.

It's like the Free Market version of "stop hitting yourself."
We buy bottled water because our water has a lot of iron and does not taste real good, and we are renting, so not gonna install a water softener. We buy smaller bottles and gallon jugs. Have same problem at my office too, but that is mostly because of the mineral deposits so we just use a PUR filter otherwise the coffee pot really hates it eventually.
thru the outside part, into the colon. pierce it all the way thru.
Water mains cost twenty thousand per kilometre just for your share of the water. A water supply fifty kilometres away means your household is obliged to cough up a million dollars.
[deleted]
Michigan doesn't have significant issues with water supply, and I don't believe there are any issues with groundwater stress in the region this well is located in. 

As such, shipping water out of the watershed is not really an issue. Also, to point out the obvious, you know what else is shipping water out of the watershed? Farming.
He didn't say water wasn't a human right. Look it up.
My water's 'safe' but it tastes kinda weird straight from the tap. I solve this with a Brita filter water jug. Tada! Ice-cold clean and fresh tasting water whenever I want.
Where it's safe? There's corroding lead pipes all throughout America and there's no sign of nationwide repair. I'd only drink tap if my life depended it.
I'd recommend a water filter though, tap water tastes like shit.
A 5 gallon jug of water is $5
I never thought about that.  That's awesome.
I live in a smallish town that is growing rapidly.  There is so much chlorine in the water right now even the smell makes me sick.
How do you convince someone to buy bottled water and how is it that I'm immune?
I see where you're coming from, but I highly doubt that they would slow down production in Cali just because they have a new plant in Michigan. 
I do wish more people were aware of how much water it takes to grow almonds though, especially with all these health nuts pushing almond milk. Huge waste of water imo.

Those filters that you can attach to the end of your faucet, or really any kind of filtration system, will make your water taste better. So long as the filters are changed out when recommended.
I thought those things were expensive when I bought them but they have paid for themselves countless times.
There are also lots of places where that is not the case.  Unless you are drinking from a private well, first check Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) sent to you by your water provider or on the EPA's website: https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136:102::::::.  Without doing basic research, you are guessing.

You don't understand a damn thing about basic chemistry nor the standards at which municipal water supplies are held.
In my city, its the service lines between the city pipes and the houses.  Or its lead pipes in the houses.  And yet, the city still puts tons of calcium oxalate in everyone's water, which clogs pipes and fixtures.  
It's my go-to, when people try to justify shopping at Walmart by claiming they always have the lowest prices.
To think like a marketing/advertising/propaganda specialist, you have to stop focusing on manipulating individuals one at a time and instead focus on techniques that manipulate *groups* of people.
True, though I find the jug to be better for my house since the water from the tap isn't as cold as when I get it from the fridge. I'm oddly particular about it.
You're right, I probably used the wrong words and I guess lead doesn't 'corrode', but the fact remains lead is getting into the water and people are getting lead poisoning. Towns such as Flint Michigan had a significant problem very recently. 
That really doesn't have much to do with Walmart having the lowest prices. Every grocery store does this -- it's part of Coca-Cola's and PepsiCo's racket that the 16-20oz are a worse deal than the 2L bottles. At my local grocery store, 2L of Coke/Pepsi are typically $1.99 regular price with 16oz for $1.49. The generic store brand soda is $0.75 for a 2L and $0.35 for a 12oz can.
You're particular about the liquids you take into your body? What a weirdo.

Next you'll tell me that you won't eat whatever you find lying around. /s
Flint had a problem because water processing plant engineers not only made a mistake and didn't add an important water hardening step, the local government worked to cover it up.  A major error would actually pose no threat if it were corrected quickly enough, but months of soft water would erode the salt layer that forms almost immediately when properly treated water ran through it.

Most municipal water plants have hiccups from time to time.  Typically these incidents are reported on via their bulletins, publlished in newspapers, and mentioned on TV.  You've probably heard seen or heard them, but they're pretty minor.  Sometimes it's a major incident, but the system is fairly resilient and negative effects are only present after a long-term failure.  Flint was a special case in this regard.


I wish my dog would stop eating things he finds on the ground during our walks. :/

>the first known object from another star system to pass through our own.  

I thought Pluto was the first
what about the turd-shaped one not long ago?
oh wow politicizing space now too? 
This would not have happened if we built that damn wall /s
Oh yeah, does it have papers? If not I'm gonna build a wall. 
Damn immigrant asteroids, stealing our asteroids' orbits. /s
Maybe there's protomolecule on it. 
Pluto isn't passing through, and I don't think anyone really considers it to be anything than a leftover of the formation of the Solar System, with regards to origin.
The turd flew fast and true, and is on a long trip away from our system. The object referenced in this article is supposedly an interstellar object that entered our system some time ago, but was caught by local gravity. 
I thought Pluto is an exoplanet

https://www.seeker.com/remind-me-again-why-isnt-pluto-a-planet-1765334213.html
ah, thank you. 
Exoplanets orbit other stars. Pluto orbits the Sun like the other planets, but these days it's classed as a dwarf planet because there are, we now know, hundreds of objects like it out there.
what evidence is there that Pluto was formed in this solar system 
What evidence is there that it wasn't? 
it's orbit not in the plane of all the other planets 
It still orbits in the same direction as the other planets, which points to it being formed in our solar system.

Also the orbital planes of each planet are not perfectly aligned; each one has a minor skew or angle even if less extreme than Pluto's.
it is within normal limits. not everything is perfectly on the same plane. 
That's not really evidence for it being interstellar, considering there's any number of reasons its orbital plane is slightly askew.
Yeah that just means it might have passed near a massive object at some point. I'm sure jupiter formed near the sun and migrated outwards. 
I think you are getting confused about gas giant/ice giant migration. Jupiter had to have formed past the frost/ice line for it to have all the mass that it has. 

We have seen that in other star systems, Jupiter like bodies extremely close to their parent stars. And because we know that in order to get to that size, they need ice, rock, and metal, we know that they must have migrated inwards.

Anything past the metal line will get metals when it forms. Anything past the rock line will get rocks and metals when it forms. Anything past the metal, rock and frost/snow line will get everything. Being past all three lines means that an object will have the mass to pull in all those gases before the star blows them all way. 
They have been pumping on an expired permit since 1988!  

>Nestle, has been pumping spring water out of the San Bernardino National Forest under a permit that expired in 1988
British Columbia didn't even have a restriction on ground water usage until Nestle came in and pumped millions of liters of water to sell in local stores around the province.


They finally stepped up and decided they cannot be allowed to do that without paying anything. So, they made them pay! ..... a whopping $2.25 for every MILLION liters!


That's $1.80 for 264172 gallons!


With the time involved to draft this up, i'm not even sure what was the point. Might as well be free still. 
Fine the hell out of em, then use the money to start a de-sal plant.
Its just sad because if the state found out that I have an illegal well for private home use I'd go straight to jail.
They've habitually been evil.

Sue nestle for contributing to the drought. Charge them 10x per gallon what the public has to pay.
Nestle is taking water from the Great Lakes as well. 

Copying and pasting:

This is all a pointless distraction. Stop the bottling plant tomorrow and California is no less fucked than it was yesterday.
Nestle uses ~244 million gallons per year which sounds like a lot so people are up in arms. **Almonds in California use about 1.1 trillion gallons per year which makes Nestle's use about 0.02% of what almonds used.** Compare it to agriculture as a whole in the state and its another order of magnitude smaller fraction. Why are people not boycotting stores selling California almonds? Crashing the demand for almonds would do more to save California than stopping Nestle from bottling some water
Important quote from the original Desert Sun article:

>  the Forest Service has allowed Nestle to keep using an expired permit for nearly three decades

I'm not sure this really counts as 'illegal'. It's not really Nestle's fault that the Forest Service has been gutted to the point that they don't have the manpower to review the application for renewal. 

Is bottling water in a drought a bad idea? Almost certainly. But Yahoo is stretching things by calling it illegal. 
It's all the Forrest services fault for not following up on renewal requests. Nestle has paid it's permit fee every year keeping the old permit in effect until the state acts on the renewal request.
Nestle is doing nothing illegal.

http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/

>In a 1993 letter, then-District Ranger Elliott Graham wrote that because the company had kept paying the annual fee and had complied with regulations, "the permit is deemed valid until a new Special Use Permit is reissued."

>Lawrence said Nestle has sought to renew the expired permit several times and is ready to work with the Forest Service.

>"We just have to work through the process," Lawrence said. He said Nestle is waiting for word from the Forest Service on the next steps and would welcome "a science-based study of the watershed."


>"The Nestle permit is just one of those 360. It's not like we've purposely held that one out," said Al Colby, a public services staff officer who oversees permits. "The thing is that Nestle continues to pay the fee that they were charged back when the permit was still valid."

>Because of that, he said, the expired permit's conditions have remained in effect. "Basically as long as they're paying the fee that was established before it expired, the permit is enforceable."

>The national forest has continued to collect a permit fee of $524 from Nestle Waters each year.
Does anyone really think that this has any measurable impact on water availability? Over 8 million gallons of water flows through the Hoover dam every minute. If Nestle ceased to bottle water in California, it mean that the water table in the Palm Springs basin would be ever so slightly higher. It doesn't solve anything... Time to put down the pitchforks.
why is everyone so angry with nestle instead of with their state department?

is nestle was actually doing this completely illegally the state department would have guys down there to shut everything down. there is corruption at the state level that allows nestle to do what they do.
Is there a way to stop the corporations regin over society?
What you are seeing is part of a campaign to demonize water users in California.  Almond growers, farmers, ranchers, everybody except the legislature that failed to take the money the voters approved for water management and use it for water management because the last drought eventually ended.  
Almonds.

Alfalfa.

Rice.

Go research.
I remember back in November people from California were laughing at our Snowpocolypse. Well guess what snow turns into?
I know all you young guys bitch about this and want to blame everything on the older generation but, **we** used to drink water from a garden hose, not from **disposable plastic bottles** 
I fucking hate Nestle. Such an evil company to work for. They're destroying parts of Africa as well.
As long as the citizen serf peons know their place, right California? 
[deleted]
There is a huge circlejerk against Nestl√© while PepsiCo or Tyson Food does the exact same thing! 

I wonder why nothing is said about them. Oh I forgot! They are American companies! 
If it wasn't California then people would be in uproar.  But the smugness hath overpowered.
Nestle has lost all of my business. 
TIL nestle should have stopped pumping water before I was born.
Dear Jerry Brown, you had some pretty tough talk to gardeners and homeowners, will you show the same plums to business or will you be a pussy.
So what about buying Sparkletts water instead? Anyone know if they're doing business above board? What are the alternatives for CA residents? 
Ca - nestle omg Stahhp 

Nestle - don't wanna 

Ca - k

screw you I love their products. you hipsters can boycott and pretend you're having an effect all you want.

I see the media is trying to detract the blame for the drought  from agricultural industry to Nestle. 
So cut the pipeline. Someone go find it, dig it up, and take it out.
Can we just get a pipeline from Washington to California and call it a day. Don't they have alot of spare water.
Petition to keep Nestle away from any source of water anywhere would be nice.

Good.  We need more post about Nestle.  This is an important issue!

Oh wait, it's not significant in any way at all other than reddit's love for circlejerking furiously as if criticizing somehow elevates one's personal standing, my bad.
I knew I've been drinking California water this whole time!
I'm not going to stop buying Nestle products. They found a way to make money for essentially a product that is free. The state or regulating office is just as bad if not worse then the company for allowing it to happen.
So is there a chance that they will be criminally charged this time?
People have been discussing this for a decade. congrats, you all let it happen.
I'm surprised there aren't any protests being organized!
article from 2 years ago where Nestle CEO wants to privatize water.

http://naturalsociety.com/nestle-ceo-water-not-human-right-should-be-privatized/
Corporations are people, people go to jail for breaking the law, send the CEO to Pelican Bay!
Can some explain to me why there isn't legal grounds o shut down the entirety of Nestle? I think they commit more illegal and heinous acts than every day than politicians/s
I say get rid of bottled water... why the fuck is america the biggest consumer of this shit? i mean seriously?
So, all of their California water-based income over the past 27 years has been illegitimate? Cool. Fine them for 100% of every penny they made over those years on California water and then auction off their pumping land.
Access to fresh water should not be a corporate right.
They are fucking unforgivable. 
Money will be in the pockets of the people that matter to make this happen. 
This is probably going to end up like the pharmaceutical companies: they know what they are doing and will still make more profits by paying a fine rather than doing what's legal.
About 30 years ago, they removed laws prohibiting profiting from selling drinking water.
Wouldn't state be able to takeover the plant and take all the water bottles and air drop them to all drought areas? 
Send the executives to jail? 
Holy shit.  Just when I think Nestle can't do anything worse, shit like this comes up.  The worst part of all is that no matter how hard one tries to avoid one of their brands, it seems like they are all over the place.  
Tapped.  Watch this documentary!
I'm in full support of killing nestle 
This is part of why I do my best to avoid anything Nestl√©. They are a fucking evil company. 
Boycott Nestle. Spread the word. Every business that sells their products should remove them from the shelves. Raise awareness.

Since law apparently dosen't look like giving a shit for them, don't think it will be same for you if you attempt a vigilante act...

Boycott by the consumers and the sellers is the only way you can really act. 
Too fucking bad. If they don't stop,  charge the ceo with ecoterrorism and blow their bottling plants up. I fully endorse the death penalty for that evil piece of shit.
Cali is retarded point blank ...  all that technology and those fucks cant filter salt water yet ???!?!?!? really?!?!!? Pure lazyness
It's treason plain and simple. 
I love Arrowhead water. I'd certainly be sad to see it go. I think it's better to bottle and sell pure spring water than to expect people to drink it somewhere downstream after it's been mixed with agricultural runoff, the treated effluent from the sewage systems of towns upstream, and other interesting things.
I'm fairly certain I don't buy any nestle products but I wanted to be certain. [Here's a list of all the brands they own.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands) 
Well, that is how long it takes them to get around to checking permits at the current funding levels. 27 years sounds about right for government regulators.
and they have been paying the permit fee every year keeping the old permit in effect until the forest service gets around to their 25 year old renewal request.

http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/
Well to be fair Nestle did file the proper paperwork and then payed all the associated fines its the government officials that sat on it so blame them instead. Also Nestle uses like .02% of all water consumption in California you want your water to stop being wasted. then stop buying almonds that's roughly 60% of all the water. 
I'd put this right up there on the "how is this allowed to happen??" list with the billions in subsidies gifted to oil companies
Yet if we dare drive our own cars with an expired reg the system can't wait to get its hands on you and your money.
Dude, the Obama Administration is scheming ways to give Nestle a back-dated permit for this thievery.

But I'm sure the term President Goldman Sachs is news to you.
It's probably a small amount because it's going to just one or a couple of people that set the deal up.
How mqny swimming pools can you fill with that amount of water o.o
Clearly, your elected representatives are acting in your best interests
>With the time involved to draft this up, i'm not even sure what was the point. Might as well be free still. 

That was the point. If Nestle doesn't have that contract the town can later give out a reasonable rate. Instead the town is locked in. 
[deleted]
Why? The Forest Service has explicitly told them they can keep pumping from the well. Nestle has submitted the proper paperwork year after year but the forest service hasn't reviewed it so has told Nestle until they actually make a decision on their renewal, they can legally keep pumping.

So why is it ethical to fine Nestle for the slow processing times at the Forest Service? If it took 10 years to renew your driver's license, would you agree to fining drivers for having expired licenses? 
[deleted]
What the fuck.

Wells are illegal unless you tell the state? Is it for property tax purposes?
different rules for the rich than for the poor....

At least you're not in Oregon, where you can be fined for collecting rain water.
>if the state found out that I have an illegal well

Well you see that is the difference. Nestle has been told by the forest service they can continue to use the well because they've filed the proper paperwork but the forest service hasn't gotten to their paperwork yet. The forest service has explicitly told them what they're doing is allowed and thus not illegal.  


I like to dream that in a few years consumers will band together and cut off all sales revenue to companies such as this. 
Did you even read the wiki? A $65 billion company with 275,000 employees and the "list of evil things they've done" is 7 items long. 
3 are allegations that were not proven. 
Two are tainted products that resulted in recalls (remember, this is the largest food company in the world, that's a pretty good record). 
One was the company wanting to collect a debt ($6 million) from Ethiopia. 
One was complaining that the use child labor overseas, pretty much like every company ever that manufactures in certain countries. 
And finally, they tried to convince people their baby formula was superior to breast milk, 33 years ago. 

I don't think it would be difficult to find dozens of companies that have been much more "evil". 
The big picture is bureaucracy!
>Nestle is operating under the terms of their expired permit under permission of the Forest Service until they get around to issuing them a new permit. source[1] 

Your source does not say that. It does not use the word "permission". Full stop. "Allow" does not necessarily include or imply explicit. permission. Not doing anything would also be allowing something to happen. 
http://i.imgur.com/EUYaPkL.png

Nestle's use is the black dot. And Nestle's use wouldn't even be visible at that scale when compared to the state's entire water usage. 
This should be at the top. But alas...
I agree that people are singling in on Nestle in particular, but it doesn't matter how much they're pulling up. California's in a DROUGHT. They claim to be pulling up in a "sustainable" manner, but that's bullshit when it's only getting worse & worse. Any amount they pull up is unnecessary & doesn't help the problem at all, it only worsens it. Did you pick up on this from your first link?

>Even with California deep in drought, the federal agency hasn't assessed the impacts of the bottled water business on springs and streams in two watersheds that sustain sensitive habitats in the national forest.

No one is even paying attention to its impact.

It might be sustainable if the farming industry cut back, but fat chance of that happening. Pretty much all parties involved won't stop since no one else will, it's ridiculous. I lived in California for several years. When I was a child, I remember how cold and foggy mornings would consistently be. And foggy days were some of my fondest memories and what I would equate CA with. But in high school it seemed to be quite a rare occurrence. And nowadays you're lucky if you get a foggy day once a year.

It would be nice if SOME companies took actions or measures to mitigate this damage, plus Nestle is so massive I'm sure they could afford to lose this revenue source. Hell, they might even get good PR if they halt their operation and call for others to do the same or cut back. But for now, yeah, evil corporation that doesn't even need to continue what they have been doing for decades.

Exactly! It seems like reddit is on some blind hatred band wagon. I posted this to /r/losangeles and got allot of hate. Maybe it'll fair better here.  

Nestle uses 705 million gallons a year [LINK](http://www.newsweek.com/nestles-california-water-permit-expired-27-years-ago-321940), which is sold mostly in the United States. Lets also mention how it takes 5.4 gallons of water for one head of broccoli [Link](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/wheres-californias-water-going). There's also almonds, walnuts, and several other crops that use up more water than Nestle. Should Nestle be using expired permits to fill there water bottles, No, but Nestle is hardly the problem. California uses 38 billion gallons a day, [Link](http://ca.water.usgs.gov/water_use/2010-california-water-use.html) which is a drop in the bucket compared to Nestle. The question we gotta ask is the water being used in a reasonable way, and beneficial to people or the economy. When you see statistics of a desert city such as Palm Spring using 736 gallons per person, not including agriculture, [Link](http://www.water.ca.gov/urbanwatermanagement/docs/Report%20to%20Leg%20on2010%20UWMPs-6-25-2012.pdf) and look at google maps to notice there's a place in the middle of the desert that has atleast 10 golf courses [Link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B045'07.4%22N+116%C2%B020'29.5%22W/@33.7520551,-116.3415278,164759m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0), you see the biggest problem is not Nestle.
I think everyone can live without almonds. Ban them
Stop the bottling plant tomorrow and California is no less fucked than it was yesterday. Nestle uses ~244 million gallons per year which sounds like a lot so people are up in arms. Almonds in California use about 1.1 trillion gallons (a trillion is a thousand thousand million) per year which makes Nestle's use about 0.02% of what almonds used. Compare it to agriculture as a whole in the state and its another order of magnitude smaller fraction. Why are people not boycotting stores selling California almonds? Crashing the demand for almonds would do more to save California than stopping Nestle from bottling some water.

Quite literally the water used by Nestle is a drop in the bucket used by just almond farmers and is basically some water vapor compared to agriculture as a whole. [Handy picture](http://i.imgur.com/EUYaPkL.png)  Water used by Nestle is the little black box in the top. 
That's not really how it works.
IIRC Nestle takes the same amount of water, per year, that the city of Portland uses in one day.

EDIT: decided to fact check myself. According to the city of Portland there are 181,100 services, or places that receive water, with an average use of 289 gallons per service per day. That means Portland uses 52,337,900 gallons per day. 

For Nestle, I can't find a precise number, but 244 million of gallons per year seems to be the average number. 

That means Nestle is taking the same amount of water ***per year*** that Portland uses ***in four days***. So no, Nestle is not a major contributor to the drought.
or.... how about **you** stop buying water in **disposable plastic bottles**

I mean... fucking seriously..... STOP buying their shit.

Beyond the drought, **look at the fucking waste**
http://i.imgur.com/EUYaPkL.png

See that black dot at the top, that is the amount of water used by Nestle in comparison to the amount used by almonds on a yearly basis. 
> Sue nestle for contributing to the drought.

You know people end up drinking that water? 
Ok. 10 X 750,000,000 gallons X 27 years since expiration X ($1.50 / 1,000) average price to consumers = $303,750,000 fine or 1.97% of their 2014 profits

Should they sue everybody else who contributed to the drought too?
God DAMNIT!!!  Leave my lakes alone you fucking FUCKS.
Jokes on them, I pee in them lakes.
Soon they'll just be the Pretty Good Lakes.
I read trillion as billion and thought to myself, "well that means almonds only use like 4x as much water, that's not such a huge difference..."

A TRILLION GALLONS OF WATER HOLY FUCK. 1,100,000,000,000 gallons. woah.
Driving a car with an expired registration is illegal whether or not you get pulled over.
Just a question how is bottling bad during a drought? Less likely to evaporate and can be stored for years? I mean farmers spray water all over a hot fields and lose so much to evaporation that it's even ridiculous to farm in that heat.
Not entirely related, but Yahoo rarely writes its own news. They used to just rehash a lot of AP and Reuters stories. Now they tend to rehash a lot of odd blogs and gossip rags.

This story was written for takepart.org which is part of a bigger conglomerate of opposition groups to large food companies such as Nestle and others.

Viewing who actually wrote a story being presented on Yahoo is key. They even mix in sponsored ads that present themselves as stories into their news feeds.
If you are trying to say that the government is inefficient, I don't believe you. The government is our savior. The real problem here is that Nestle is a privately held company and not part of our government.
Pretty sure District Ranger Elliot Graham has that authority. 
No single golf course has a noticeable impact. No single almond field has a noticeable impact. Nothing by itself has a significant impact to the percentage. 

But all those little .02%'s add up. If they caught 250 Nestles that would be the same as the entire 25% reduction of Household usage. 
Yeah, but Communism doesn't really work. 

Corporate rule is the natural course of capitalism. 
Right now at the supermarket near my home, almond milk is on sale and is 18 cents cheaper per litre than regular milk.

You should do some research of your own. Rice is not a water intensive crop. Fields are flooded, yes, but where they do this, the Sacramento River Delta is ideal for this agriculture. Rice farmers do not waste water. Growing rice in the Sacramento River Delta is environmentally responsible. Learn about rice farming before you comment on it.
Don't worry, we're going to take all of that water from WA

If you guys learn how to fucking drive, then we agree to stop drinking bottled water. Shit we'll beat the hell out of Justin Bieber as a bonus too.

Protest Nestle, get beaten by police, remember why people were protesting police first.
Considering we collectively write their paychecks you'd think we could have some influence on their behavior...
Corporations are legal entities. Their charters can be revoked but americans dont control their govt anymore.
Is Nestle a young black male?

Free water is how California got to this point in the first place. If water was accurately priced, farmers might be using better irrigation techniques, and people wouldn't water their lawns daily (I know this isn't a significant use of water, just an example).
Yes, tap water may be safe, thanks to the miracle of chlorine and filtering techniques -  but depending on what kinds of geological formations the water has run over, and depending how far downriver the city lies, there are always going to be undesirable things in the water. I used to drink nothing but tap water, until I started work at a water treatment plant one summer.

I think that people should be picky about the kind of water they drink, just as they ought to be about the quality of the vegetables and fruits they buy, or the meat they buy.
Top hit on Google:

Try researching and spell checking before calling anyone else retarded. "Laziness"
I'd love an app that would allow me to scan a barcode to find out if it's a Nestle product.  

They produce so much under so many different brand names, it's just impossible for me to remember everything.
its kind of crazy how many different bottled water ~~brads~~ brands they own.  Its like twice as much as any other type of brand they own.
Thanks for the list!  Nestle is a horrible company in many ways... such as this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEFL8ElXHaU

I think the best thing we can all do is simply to not buy bottled water anymore.  Reusable bottles rock and since many of the water companies use tap water anyway, we get water without the extra costs! 
This will be the easiest boycott ever. I apparently already don't buy anything they sell.
FUCK, they make digiorno pizza
God damn I was clear until I made it to coffee mate....
Hot Pockets :(
They got Hot Pockets too?! Nooooooo!!!!!!!
Now I am very sad. My favourite water brand is owned by them! Gotta switch then :(
It pisses me off because as far as bottled waters go, Arrowhead is one of the better tasting ones and has a really useful bottle to re-use. I'm going to stop from a moral standpoint (I had not been aware they were Nestle-owned before) of course. I'd use my local Montana's Treasure but suddenly it seems like everyone stopped stocking it.
I go out of my way to buy Nestle products because 99% of the stories attacking Nestle I see on reddit are either misrepresented or are outright fabrications. This "story" is no different. 
Bribe the right politicians and the regulatory body that oversees you will always be criminally understaffed.

Well, if California wasn't busy spending that money catering to illegal immigrants at the DMV, assuredly this would of been taken care of.

How much does Nestl√© pay you to comment on reddit?
But I already bought this   -------E
Is it that we should stop buying almonds, or that the price of almonds should reflect the true price of producing them? If because of water shortages, they produce less almonds, the prices should go up. I get the concept that our demand is driving this, but our demand didn't cause the misuse of the water.
And the average person uses vastly less. The average farm uses vastly less. Imagine if a golf course was stealing all of its water. Do you honestly think that would deserve a free pass? Because it wouldn't. Someone would probably be charged with a crime. 

And source on this filed paperwork and fines? Not that it would negate any blame for Nestle. They *did not have a permit!*
How about this: Farmers don't have time machines. Almond trees take a decade to mature. Our water supply is and was fine... we are just in a FUCKING DROUGHT. 

This is what a drought is. It is NO ONE'S fault. Blaming farmers for "wasting" water is getting mad at them for not being able to predict a drought 15 years in the future. 
Source for your numbers? I can guarantee you that 60% of California's water does not go to almond farming, so you may want to clarify

That would make sense if Nestle was the one that decided they should have to pay something and launched the whole procedure to have it in writing. Which they did not.
One opened in Port Hueneme (basically Oxnard), but it's only irrigation water. None of it will go to civilian use and we are of course subsidizing the water, so we basically paid big-agro with a multi-million dollar complex that we they will take for granite and not improve their irrigation techniques. *sigh*
Use the money to build a water park!
I heard the beer there is so-so
Because regulatory capture is not a thing that actually exists.
Thats not what the information in the article said.
I hope your check from Nestle cleared *before* you wrote that.
De Sal plants have been efficient and economic for at least a decade?
Well, you sure cleared that up for me. Thanks, professor. 
Stupid and wasteful? Have you seen the things tax dollars pay for? Wars of aggression come to mind. Even if they got some toilet water out of desal a decade from now that would still be a more of a return than so many other "necessary" expenditures. Going to the moon was also stupid and wasteful not to mention dangerous. 
Yup, had 3 black unmarked suvs pull up onto my property and start taking pictures. No phone call, no letter, nothing, just showed up within 6 months of move in and my Dad saw them and approached which they decided was threatening so they ignored him completely,  didn't say a word and wrapped up within a few minutes and took off. My dad is on the phone with 911, and trying to prevent them from leaving so they ran him down. Found out later from the dispatcher that they were with the city. And apparently its not assault if you just roll off the hood...

A month later we received citations for improperly cleaning up brush in a nature preserve... on our 5 acre property... :-(  God bless this country, probably should have told them we were with BP and tbey would have let us dump our motor oil I to the creek.
It's for water conservation purposes. You have to have a permit for a well. Nestl√©s permit expired in 1988... Soooo. 
Ground water doesn't come from a pocket contained within just your property. It's a resource shared among a pretty wide geographic boundary and permitting ostensibly keeps a single user from depleting the groundwater resources of all their neighbors.

Much like the milkshake analogy from There Will be Blood. 
Different rules for corporations and individuals
Nestle has been told by the forest service they can continue to use the well because they've filed the proper paperwork but the forest service hasn't gotten to their paperwork yet. The forest service has explicitly told them what they're doing is allowed and thus not illegal. 


Hey man, the state needs the revenue from water usage so bad that they will fine broke ass home owners for collecting rainwater but a huge corporation which sucks out millions of gallons a day from ground water... nope, don't need their money!
You go do something without a permit for 27 years and see if anyone say oh well just let him catch up on it real quick. No your ass would be hauled off to jail and hit with everything they think they could stick to you.

Corporations shouldnt just get slaps on the wrist for this shit.
You probably have some of their products in your house right now. 
Phillip Morris/Altria.
Chiquita has been known to overthrow governments to get their way.
The baby formula battle continues to this day.  Nestle claims they comply with the WHO and international codes put in place to protect babies, but their deeds don't match their words, dozens of NGOs are constantly calling them to account, and many people still boycott Nestle for this.  It should go without saying, that the totality of a 40 year fight isn't going to be captured by one section of a Wikipedia page.  
>ou make an unfair comparison between a single corporation operating outside of their permits,

They're not. They've been told "Since it's taking us forever to issue new permits, just keep following the old ones". If it took 10 years to renew your driver's license that expires every 5 years, would you agree to fine drivers for the slow processing time at the DMV?

>Quite literally the water used by Nestle is a drop in the bucket used by just almond farmers and is basically some water vapor compared to agriculture as a whole. Handy picture[1] [RES ignored duplicate link] Water used by Nestle is the little black box in the top. 

You're comparing an entire industry to one company. The same logic applies to probably every almond farmer. 
Because in the central valley where almonds are grown, farmers = jobs. When really farmers don't pay well and a lot of them hire illegals.  
I'm fine with changing their agriculture structure as well. I'm just very aware of Nestle's business practices and they should really be shut down because of them.
The average service in Portland uses 289 gallons per day. Or 120,000 per year. Nestle uses 2000 times that. 2000. And their breaking the law to do it.

That's not something that deserves ignoring. 
> STOP buying their shit

I don't.
After paying extra for shitty bottled water?
You know the water is not sold locally? They are exporting water from a drought-stricken area.
We must go deeper.
Considering the massively predatory, abusive, and wasteful business practices nestle used in california and in several other states and even canada to acquire water rights for fractions of pennies on the dollar, I think we should probably nip them in the bud first.
legal vs. illegal. do you understand the difference?
Get a lot of liquid nitrogen, freeze the lakes, then point fingers at Nestle for shutting down the lakes. :)
Additional emphasis:

> the Forest Service **has allowed** Nestle

The lack of a current permit is on the Forest Service being too understaffed to do the environmental study to approve a new permit. 

To use you're analogy, it's as if DMV said, "sorry our computers are down, let me just change the date on your current reg and initial it. There, you're all set."
A better analogy is staying in your apartment after your lease expired. But you keep paying rent and your landlord keeps cashing the checks.
Not when the DMV (Forest service) has given explicit permission to drive with an expired registration (water permit) due to the DMV's (Forest Service) delayed processing time.
So if the state just stops registering cars for 20 years you either won't drive or happily accept the tickets because whoops my fault!
True.  But that's regular people logic.  In corporate business logic doing things with an expired license often just lands them a small slap on the wrist and stern finger wave to never do it again.  And if they do, we will slap their wrist and wave our finger at them a little harder.
Just google how bad the drought is in California. Look at the pictures.
Because Nestle is taking most of it for the sole purpose of profit. The finest example of greed. 
It's clear that you're one of those on the beach throwing the starfish back.  I'm just too fucking pragmatic I guess.
Responsible purchasing and voting.

Analyse your purchasing habits; research the politicians and parties you vote for.
It's as if your DA is cracking down on sleeping on park benches in a jurisdiction where arson and murder are both rampant and legal.
I never claimed anything against the Rice Industry. Could be great for its location, could be terrible for its location. I am not qualified to make that call.

My primary point, the only reason why Nestle's permit is even under question is due to the drought. There are far far far more water intensive industries that are in need of attention than Nestle. 

Should you write to your congressman about Nestle. Sure. However, you also better be writing about the Agriculture industry as well. The state SHOULD (One would hope) have qualified people to make those calls about what is environmentally responsible and what is not.


Uhh...preliminary research shows that rice is a highly water intensive plant whose crop yield has been significantly affected by the drought...
A snowman!

Look out nestle, reddit is angry.
well my mom insists on filtering the tap water and out fridge has a filter on it as well (i get most of my own water from the fridge). do 

but i don't imagine that bottled water is any better since almost 47.8% is actually tap water
Go me for not fucking googling before popping off my big mouth lol , i retract my previous statement.
Look up an app called Buycott
well I don't buy Hot Pockets and I get store brand frozen pizzas the only thing on that list I'd be likely to pick up of theirs would be chocolate. 
Yeah but it's just country specific brands.
I didn't know they bottled the Market Pantry water my company buys (target brand). I doubt if I can convince my company to switch but I'll just start bringing my own.
But I am thirsty now and don't have a bottle with me and am looking at a vending machine with water
Looks like it *is* delivery now.
And just about every other "bake-at-home" pizza that you can find in the stores.

>It is NO ONE'S fault. 

Farming in the desert vs the midwest, where there is ample water?

It's greed's fault
For comparison to fill one pool of the same size in LA county using residential rates would be $131.31.

Water rates are taken from [The LA Department of Water and Power](https://ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-financesandreports/a-fr-waterrares/a-fr-wr-schedulearesidential?_adf.ctrl-state=94a1zdv40_4&_afrLoop=1285153512300450)
>take for ~~granite~~ granted

ftfy
I would assume it is less costly to desalinate ocean water for agricultural processes than potable water for human consumption as it would not to be as "clean". It could be a simple matter of economics since desalination is not profitable in most situations.
Ah, so on par with building stadiums with taxpayer money.
What exactly is the point you are replying to? Why should we fine Nestle despite them not doing anything illegal? Why is it Nestle's problem that the Forest Service has such a permit backlog it's taking them forever to renew the permit? 

So if I get this straight, you think it reasonable to fine Nestle for how slow the Forest Service is taking to process the paperwork? 


Okay, well the guy above is a troll, I'd like to start a convo rather. De-sal plants are actually fairly wasteful. Currently, they use around 15,000 kilowatt hours per million gallons. That's more expensive than importing in at 14,000KH and fat more than cleaning waste water (which we should do anyway) at 8,300KH. 

The market is there, but the money should go into research first.. Not just thinking about the present.

Have fun with your brine waste. 
Maybe in Saudi Arabia...
What part of CA?  In San Diego, they'll [confiscate your land](http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/16/county-vietnam-veteran-still-locked-in-land-dispu/) if you don't clear the native backcountry chaparral.
It makes you really wonder if you own anything you buy anymore. Homes and private property are the #1 most expensive purchase most people will ever make. It infuriates me when I see stories like this of someone trying to take advantage of natural groundwater or cleaning up brush on their own property. It sounds like the state dept is overfunded and trying to justify its expense.
They hit your dad with a car?
Are you even reading the articles about this situation? The Forest Service has EXPLICITLY given them permission to continue operating on their expired permit. This is exactly the same as the DMV saying "Well since it's taking forever to get licenses renewed, you can drive on expired licenses for the time being". 
yeah, the nature of modern business has pretty much killed any hope in the "free market", if there ever was such a thing.  How can I, as a consumer, vote with my wallet responsibly when a corporation is allowed to have infinity subsidiaries of different names and are allowed to hide their connections and relabel under different names etc etc etc.

It's a full time job for a team of people to keep up with the shenanigans of a single company.  Nearly impossible for the average consumer to do.
I try to be a pretty aware consumer. I did actually just post a link to the list of nestle brands elsewhere in this thread and I think we're clean. 
Pellegrino kit kat ..Im a nestle product user. Im ashamed that I like their products.
The fact that dozens on NGOs have made a career out of claiming a corporation is evil isn't real surprising. According to these NGOs, pretty much any attempt at selling their products (products that are geared towards babies or toddlers) is considered (by the NGOs) a violation of the WHO guidelines (International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes). 

The problem here is two-fold. First, these are guidelines. They hold no force of law in most of the world. Second, if you actually read the guidelines, they pretty much call on baby formula manufacturers (not just Nestle) to make absolutely no attempt to market or sell their product. No free products, no promotions, no discounts, none of the other things that companies use to market their products. 

So, finding "violations" of a very onerous policy (voluntary guidelines, if you will) is pretty easy and doesn't prove that Nestle is doing anything illegal or even unethical.



Where is the source for this?
And? My point is that this entire news story is intended to distract everyone from the debate we should be having. Is it sustainable to farm in the desert, especially water intensive crops like almonds? Why are almond farmers allowed to use trillions of gallons of water but Nestle not allowed to use 244 million? Why are farmers allowed to use 90% of California's water despite only contributing 2% to the state economy? 
I'm curious as to where you're getting that data because all the data I get says otherwise.
I used to live on bottled water because the tap water contained so much chlorine it was undrinkable. The bottled water (Costco brands) was pretty damn good in comparison. Plus, I could carry it around... 

Was about $5 for a whole case of *portable water units*, which seemed extremely reasonable. 
Neither are any of the products that are produced with water. Do you think that the majority of golfers come from the same town or that most of the agricultural products are sold even within state lines? Actually, this applies to every single raw resource in global economies. If your standard was implemented strictly the entire world economy would collapse.
Considering the situation, I'd go after the people actually using significant amounts of water first, but that's just me.  
The way I've heard it, Nestle was legally allowed to keep pumping while the government decided whether or not to renew their permit, which never should have taken 30 fucking years.  There's a party in the wrong here, but for once it isn't the big corporation.
In all seriousness, that's a dangerous idea. Not because you have a chance of actually freezing the lake, but because as soon as the liquid hits the water, most of it will become Nitrogen gas. That's harmless except for the fact that it will displace oxygen.
So what have they been doing the last three decades to fix the permit?
Ah I see the issue, English must not be your native language. Allow does not mean they were given explicit permission. Merely neglecting to stop Nestle would also mean that "the Forest Service has allowed Nestle" to bottle water.
If the state says it's OK to keep driving while they process your registration, you won't get tickets.
sure it sucks but how was that not expected when you grow food where there is not enough rain? It's like the big parks in dubai.
I didn't know farmers don't try to make a profit.
Imagine if the nightly news actually reported on corporate malfeasance... 
Well, we get two parties to vote for and both are bought and paid for by corporations. 3rd Party candidates don't count because there's little shot of them actually getting elected. 

Besides, corporations and the 1% have a huge percentage of the wealth. They have, in a weird way, earned that because they hve been able to make money and then make that money work for them. 

Capitalism eventually leads to a system where a very few control the wealth and those at the bottom don't. 
...which doesn't happen due to the gutting of public education

No, it would be more like cracking down on petty larceny when bank robberies are rampant and at an all time high. 

Either way, they are breaking the law and the state can get a pretty penny out of this

Thanks!  That's exactly what I was hoping to find.
It's a cool app; made me sad that the biggest group in the app is the "demand GMO labeling" group, though.  

They do have a Boycott Nestle group, however!  I'm in it.
I personally like their chocolate, but the rest of the world is under the impression that it is crap. Maybe buying chocolate elsewhere would be a bonus.
Just so you know, most store brand items are produced by the major manufacturers. Sometimes they will tell you on the packaging who actually made it. I know that the store brand ice cream around us is actually made by Unilever, though they don't have any branding on it.
Market Pantry is a store brand, chances are that target contracts with muliple bottlers and they just slap the MP label on it. So the water your company buys may, or may not, be bottled by nestle. Only way to know for sure is to look at the code date and look up the manufacturer's id.



 


> extremely inflammatory.

Yes.  It said horrible things about my mother.
God damnit..
Bottled water is sometimes more convenient than tap water, sometimes it tastes better than if one's house is on well water. 
Oh, there are differences between waters! My favourite water has a hard, metallic flavour while you can drink it very smooth and has much sparkling, and you get the feeling of fresh breath.

Other waters might be different tasting, more or less salty, sparkling... You can greatly enjoy water :)
Monsanto? Yes.
People are making a big deal out of it because we all already knew how shitty Nestle was and this is just another outrageously shitty thing of them to be involved in. I'm well aware that the amount of water Nestle is actually using is minuscule relative to the scale of California's problems, but it still serves to reinforce my disdain for Nestle. 
Its not so much that they are to blame for CA water woes, its that CA is having water woes and Nestle is pumping out profits from a basic necessity that is in short supply while citizens are told to cut back.
No they are using the cheaper methods because there was no reason not to. 

The same thing everyone on the planet does. Yet we blame the farmers when it is no ones fault. 
Greed? Farming is like 2% of our economy dude
I was trying to figure out what big-agro's de-sal plant has to do with the granite industry. I'm dumb. 
Plus agriculture is the biggest drain in water in Cali. All these flavours and he chooses to be salty.
Not at all. Oxnard relies heavily on agriculture. I don't think it sounds like a bad deal but I haven't looked at the details and I may be wrong.
To me it seems like the major problem is getting rid of the salt. And I have some ideas about that. We could compress it into bricks, coat it with a polymer and use it for building material.

With solar and other forms of renewable power we can overcome the power inefficiencies. But yes improvements in the osmotic materials could be more efficient.
California would not exactly be pioneering desalination.  If it is good enough for other parts of the world, then it is good enough for California.  California needs to stop being so goddamn stuck up.

What the fuck else are they going to do with that electricity, and why is it more important than getting fresh water?
You are obviously smarter than the 300,000,000 people that get their water from the 16,000 de-sal plants in 25 countries around the world, including the 3 already built here in the US.

So how do you plan on ending California's drought?
Yet you double post..
And many other countries, but it would be silly for a place with running fresh water to use desal
Moreno Valley... They ended up dismissing the citations after we had to pay a lawyer to talk to them and basically pointed out that they did technically run my father over on his property so their consolation was to dismiss it because technically we did not remove any native trees or brush... we removed dead, dry foliage and removed a few palms which are not native to the "nature preserve." Talked to our neighbor later on who said he was forced to pay a biologist for 6 months of "study" to be sure that clearing our his creek would not disrupt the natural habitat of some fucking bird species. In total cost him about $7k to clear what was essentially a fire hazard on his property.

Its sad because when you track down where these assholes live... and basically they have enough ordinances and greed that if they want they can bleed ANY property owner dry. So you find the assholes at city hall who also have property with numerous violations of basic shit which is their bread and butter... so after some anonymous complaints... guess what, nothing comes of it... fabulous!
The way they treat private land owners across this great nation and especially how police have been trained to treat land owners... your either so big they are afraid of you and know you by name or your just renting from the state. Its fucked up when you suddenly realize it and as wasteful as it is to rent, you really are better off renting... you can loose everything just as easily, I mean just look at the TVA from back in the day (I think its... Tennessee Valley Authority... flooded people land for creating damns) But when you straight up rent at least you never have to deal with property related issues and you have just as many rights either way. For myself just recently a sprinkler valve failed and froze in the on position.... I shut the water off because I pay the bill... but just called the landlord and told them to fix it... easy peasy.
Or you know, they could actually fucking do business the right way, not getting let off the hook by whoever the fuck they paid off to make it go away.
I think its possible, but I had to change my shopping habits. Avoid packaged food as much as possible (that eliminates Nestle for the most part), buy locally owned brands, farmer's markets.

I know I sound like a hipster, but I'm more of a cheapskate :) I don't know how it is in other countries, but I can eat FAR more cheaply (and better) on fresh/whole foods than I can on packaged/processed. I understand this might not be the case in the US, where processed food sounds awesomely cheap.
The free market doesn't work because 99% of consumers aren't interested in joining your boycott?
Well that's good dude :) 

I wish we could just get people off the bottled water scam, specially in the Western world. 
Your post. With lots of rounding In Nestle's favour actually. 
>with an average use of 289 gallons per service per day

Round up to the nearest hundred and you get 300*400 days=120,000.

Multiply by 2000 to get 240 million. You can't compare a city to a single service. You compare a service to a service. 
I'm not saying agriculture isn't to blame for much of the water usage. It's just that he's trying to say that Nestle isn't contributing to it.
Drought or not :

Using lots of legally obtained water > using lots of illegally obtained water.  
So...nestle...
The Desert Sun article wasn't clear on what's been done, only that the ball is in the Forest Service's court and that they're grossly understaffed.
> Ah I see the issue, English must not be your native language.

Got any proof that they don't have permission? Do you seriously believe they've been pumping water for **30 years** without someone from the Forest Service being aware? Please tell me you're not that naive (which is evian spelled backwards while we're on the topic of bottled water.) 
Mostly to live comfortably. Not for the sake of just having more and more and more.
Oops, meant to reply to enyay7's comment. But anyway...

We can all only do our own small part.

If we voted more for the minor parties with better socialist policies and less corporate involvement, it would make a difference. At least a louder dissenting voice in parliament.

Same for reducing consumption (thus maintaining your money in your pockets) and making informed buying choices - don't support the worst of the exploitative corporate arseholes (Nestle being a prime example) and at least they won't end up with more wealth.

I don't like the way business and government operate in the world, so I must do my tiny bit to change the situation.
US public education spending is at record highs.
No, but that's not my point.

Ooh is that adamantium?

Personally, I like Maribou or that german one Milka. 
I'm a huge fan of Kroger brand. I know they make all their stuff themselves though. 
Ha ha you Googled it
I enjoy water a lot, just never really drink bottled water. Our tap water is icy cold and tested cleaner than most bottled water, so I have never really needed to buy bottled water. Thanks for the reply :)

So if you disregard the flavoured and sparkly water, and just compare normal bottled water, can you tell the difference then as well? If so, wouldn't that be a bit worrying?
Unless the concept of bottled water alone is outrageously shitty (and no arguments there) I just don't see how Nestle is being shitty in this scenario. Nestle is one of 108 licensed bottled water plants in California. All these plants are a small part of the industrial use category of water consumption which, as a whole uses roughly 1 percent of the water in the state as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. San Bernardino National Forest, where Nestle is pumping their water from, has 1,500 permits for land use of which 360 are expired. Nestle continues to pay their permit fee of $524 and the Forest continues to collect it. And Nestle collects only 705 million gallons of water statewide or the same amount needed to keep two golf courses green (there are over 900 golf courses in California). All of these stats (except for the [number of golf courses](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/california-golf-courses-drought-water-use-restrictions/45624204)) are from this lovely [Desert Sun](http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/) article.

So to recap Nestle is not getting special treatment, not stealing the water, not alone in bottling water, and not taking any significant amount of water. How are they the shitty ones?
Fair enough I can agree with you, I just hope not all the blame gets put on them and some gets shifted to the true horror of the problem. Droughts suck and if you let the main problem slide through then they will be laughing there asses of while eating out a can of almonds enjoying the show.

How much is the publicly traded company, Monsanto?
It's for mineral water, dumbass.
>What the fuck else are they going to do with that electricity

They're not going to use it and not burn the extra coal.
I'm in Canada but sadly even here processed seems cheaper.  I'm similar in that I tend to buy the raw products and cook for myself.  I've manage to keep 99% of nestle out of my home for over a decade so it's not impossible, but it is time consuming and difficult.

I recently learned Kirkland water is just repackaged nestle water....  so they still sneak one past me now and then through obfuscation.  I like the sound of an app that scans codes to tell for you.  It seems technology is the only way to level the playing field.
What?  That's not even in the same city, than along the same ballpark as what I was talking about.  I'm talking about a modern companies ability to hide or obfuscate which products are actually theirs making it hard if not impossible to boycott them when you want to.
The fact that people in this country pay as much as they do for municipal bottled water is one of the things that makes me worry greatly for the future of this once-great nation. 
I was comparing the amount of water the city of Portland (residential and commercial services) uses in one day. 

In 4 days, the city of Portland uses as much water as Nestle takes in a year.
Well the article says they're taking roughly the amount needed to water two golf courses for a year, I guess golf courses too?
No, what he means is.. ugh. Well, yeah.

Yes.

Nestle. 
Why wouldn't they move to a more reasonable area to farm? they spray water literally just into the air. only a small fracture actually feeds the plants.
Have to call bullshit on this one. I've lived in the Ag areas of CA. Every farmer I knew (plenty) were very well to do and huge consumers. A large percentage of them were private pilots, so they could more quickly travel between their farms in So Cal to their farms in Nor Cal and to their farms in Colorado.

I've never met a farmer that wasn't doing better than "comfortable".
Do you have a shot at getting more socialist politicians in parliament? Because saying you're in any way socialist here in America is political suicide.
Are you referring to higher ed or K-12? 
Classy people you pleb.
Nope, I've known about the Alabama Hot Pocket since high school.
I would think of sparkly water as the normal ones, but fine ;) Our tap water would work as drink water, but... I enjoy bottled water as a little bit of luxury ;). Good thing your tap water tastes so good, though!

Yes, I can taste the difference between them, they really taste different. When you have things like "it's just water, maybe from the tap and in a bottle for 10 cent" and "from a spring in a nature reserve", the taste is obvious. Second to that, how salty is it. That can depend on how near the spring is to the ocean or other salty bodies of water, or if the area of the spring is heavily used by agriculture. The former can be better, the latter is (as far as I know) bad.

I don't think it is worrying, as in water, there is more than just pure H2O. According to the bottle next to me, there is stuff in there like calcium, natrium, magnesium, sulfat and chlorid. 
When is the last time it has come up?
Oh you're in rubble now /u/nOrthSC. Looks like you're in between a rock an a hard place.

The app is called "Buycott", apparently.
Processed is not cheaper.. Source: I live in Toronto.
Except nestle uses less Cali water than the golf courses...
Because Nestl√© owns the land. 
Perhaps "socialist" was the wrong word to use - I guess I meant "less capitalist, more socially focused".

Possibly a "socialist" label would sink a campaign here (Aus), but certainly the Australian Greens Party stand on a platform of reduced corporate welfare and influence and more care for "the little guy" and perform the best of the minor parties.

As an aside, I never really understood why "communist" and "socialist" seem to be dirty words in US politics. Cold War influence?
Interesting, thanks for taking the time to explain it :)

Definitely the cold war is part of it. The other part is partisan politics and a relentless propaganda campaign. After Obama got elected there seemed to be this renewed vitriol for "socialism". They were equating it to everything that was wrong and evil about all them *European* governments. Like France! 

They used it as a buzz word so that idiots could latch on to it, not knowing what it meant, and give them something to hate. 

Even after Obamacare which forces people to buy insurance through privately owned insurance companies, they still see him as a dangerous socialist. With communism they say the Russians and China are communist and we went to war all those times to stop communism and therefore it's bad. That's really as far as that thinking goes. 

In short: Americans are stupid. 
You are welcome :)
Jesus Christ, Marie!
Is that the crux of the poplar hate of Obamacare, being forced to buy private health insurance?
I think the crux is, again, right wing propaganda. 

When Obama was elected they publicly vowed to destroy his presidency by opposing him on every single thing he wanted to do. So while Obamacare is working, more people than ever have health insurance and I heard a few studies that say medical costs aren't increasing as much. So in that way it worked. 

But if you watch Fox News or listen to any of the hundreds ultra right wing outlets they will rail on it for being socialism or just make up shit that it's doing. Like creating Death panels to kill old people. 

So I believe that's the heart and soul why people hate it. 

What frustrates me is that there are legitimate problems with it. Removing the public option is the first problem. Making it a cash grab for corporations who have benefited from deregulation for decades let them be predatory which hurts people. 

The Affordable Hearthcare Act (Obamacare) distributed money to states for the expansion of our actual socialized medicine program medicare. But because of the political tone these days many Republican governors and Republican dominated state senates didn't want to expand their medicare coverage for more people because...politics. 

In Michigan where I live, they fucked with the distribution of these funds so that they came into effect after the deadline passed where you could sign up on this government run Healthcare Marketplace (which is and has been a colossal mess). 

I'm a student with zero income. I'm also over 26 so I wouldn't be on my parents insurance (not that they have any). So for me to sign up with a policy through a corproate insurer it would have cost me 250 a month, and that was with a policy with a massive deductible. 

My mom bought health insurance but had to let it lapse when they raised the rates almost 100 bucks a month. She tried to figure out why that happened and couldn't get a straight answer. Seemingly arbitrary yearly policy increases explains one reason. Another is that the hardship subsidies (or whatever they're called) given out by the state was altered and lessened because...reasons.

So it's all kinds of confusing. And while I might go to school with people who are paying 20 bucks a month for insurance, which is great, there's a certain segment of the population that it's not helping so much. 
Nestle is also draining the groundwater from Texas. Idiot bureaucrats said it was ok. Fucking bureaucrats! 
Aren't Nestl√© the guys who said that water shouldn't be a human right?
Stupid question, but why ground water?  I would think pumping 210 million gallons out of the great lakes would have a negligible impact on the environment and the local water table.  
Nestle wants to increase production because of increased demand. Why is demand increased? Well, the entire city or Flint just stopped drinking tap water.

On a separate note, why isn't ground water covered by mineral rights like oil or natural gas? If Nestle had to pay everyone with mineral rights over the aquifer a percentage, then at least there be some return for the residents. 
Especially when Flint is having worse than third world water problems.
The problem in Flint isn't the supply, its the distribution(shitty old pipes). Nestle isn't paying less than anyone else for that water.
Yeah, keep voting for those Republicans Michigan.  By this point, you should know where their interests lay and it's not with you, the residents.
I think these are the last stages of these types of incidents. Soon water will be costlier than oil and companies like nestle will have to pay a premium.
Its not just Nestle, Anyone can get water at that price.  It's the going rate for water at that volume  If you have a problem with that, it's your governments fault, not the customers.  

Maybe they should protest, while trying to block access to where they will be pumping the water out of the ground. But I'm sure sitting on their asses complaining about it will get results....
Let's get Trump on this shit
$200 a year? Really? I know they still pay electricity and all that but shit.
Oh no! Big bad Nestle is gonna take 200 million gallons a year of our tens of trillions of gallons of water and pay the exact same amount as any other person or company who drills their own well!
Maybe the cost of ground water in that part of Michigan is close to nothing? 
Who is the governor right now? He could definitely do something about it if he wanted. Same with the legislators.
They had an executive say that water should be properly priced to discourage enormously wasteful practices that occur in industrial manufacturing and agriculture, by far the two largest consumers of the world's water. 
Aren't humans like 98% water already?
It's a misquote 
Um not to be rude but have you *visited* the great lakes recently?
>why isn't ground water covered by mineral rights like oil or natural gas?

In Canada, at least, water is always free and you pay for the infrastructure to access it. As in, anyone can build a well and go nuts. The problem lies with NAFTA --- if we start charging Nestle to pull water from aquifers, then we have to start charging farmers and brewers and other companies the same amount.

Nestle isn't taking ecologically dangerous amounts of water, at least not from Canada.
[deleted]
Flint's problem isn't supply. It's their pipes. Nestle's actions in a completely different part of the state aren't relevant to that topic whatsoever.
I thought it was plumbing that was their problem. 
Can you elaborate on how this affects Flint whatsoever? Flint has plenty of water, their source isn't the issue.
At $200 for 210 million gallons, I'd say they're paying much, much less than most folks pay. Less than any private residence in the US with a municipal water supply, that's for sure. 
That's not entirely true. Obviously, distribution is terrible and supply shouldn't be a problem but they are getting their water form the polluted flint river. 
well, the republicans I know say "there's your truth and there's my truth"... does anything more need to be said? can anything more be said?
The Tragedy of the Common
The People will pay a premium longer before corporations do.
He won't do shit about it. The poor will be screwed and a corporation will get whatever they fucking want. 
Don't point out reality. It doesn't feed the narrative. 
The problem here is that there is little to nothing that the communities that rely on this source of water can do to stop Nestle. Meanwhile, the company uses the infrastructure and provides nearly no revenue despite making massive profits off the sale of bottled water. 
Who is the governor right now?

[Greg Abbott.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott)

>He could definitely do something about it if he wanted. Same with the legislators. 

They won't. Probably took bribes or kickbacks from Nestle to let them take the water. 
And 2% DMT. 
No. Is the water polluted or something?  Doesn't Nestle have to process it anyway? 
Lake Michigan has fairly cleanish water.. Lake Erie on the other hand looks like someone dumped shit into it and it smells like that too. Yet somehow people still swim in that trash..
Are they frozen? 
Many communities around the Great Lakes use the water, including Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland.
It should cost more. The vast majority of us in America have access to safe drinking water. It's terrible to add so much plastic and transportation to the planet when you can get basically the same shit from your tap. 
They might not raise the price though. Bottled water is a competitive market and a 50 cent increase in price might harm their sales significantly. Perhaps enough that they'd just take the hit on their profit margin, perhaps not, I don't know. 
Perhaps they should use flints pipes...might speed up the process of helping those people while stalling Nestle...win win
A connection may be the money that could have been made from selling the water rights for an actual profit could have helped pay for new infrastructure. It's thin, but not totally out of left field. 
Yes, the pipes are a problem but also the polluted water from the river that is so corrosive that it washes the lead out of the pipes and wasn't properly treated.
Pipes + polluted Flint river water
Nope, if they aren't interested in an objective truth that has nothing to do with anyone owning it, they are gone.  Rush, Alex, Breitbart and Fox have killed their critical thinking skills.  

It's so incredibly sad.
I think this is the main thing that bothers me so much about the extreme views on both sides. People stop dealing in facts and trust fiction their minds or their media outlet of choice pushes as the truth, disregarding actual facts that often times even the person in question that they have chosen to listen to has stated themselves. 
Exactly, they built their own infrastructure and filter the water themselves, what is the problem?
Take a real hard look at Michigan on a map and tell me how much the community needs the water that Nestle is pumping. You might notice one of the almost 63 thousand inland lakes or the 4 huge great lakes in the area.

There will be no shortage of water for anyone from this.
What community *relies* on this water? How does the company use the infrastructure. Do they not pump and filter their product? Do  they not pay community, state, and federal taxes? Don't their employees do the same? How much does it cost any MI citizen to drill a well and pump water?

And, really, in the end, it is just not that much water to worry about. 
Yep. Money is short-term, human (and other) life is long-term. Short-sighted politicians have no understanding of long-term concepts.
I used to live near [Lake Erie](http://lakeeriealgae.com/)... that water is so polluted some years you can *smell* it in the cities.
To be specific massive amounts of run off from farm lands around lake Erie(the big problem is phosphorus) has caused the lake to suffer from large algae blooms. Some of this algae releases toxins when stressed, or when it's dying, or for no reason. On top of that when the algae does die, aerobic (oxygen using) bacteria digest it all depleting the lake of oxygen effectively killing most of the fish and other residents of the lake. The process is called eutrophication, and it's kind of the natural end game of closed bodies of water, we just made it happen really fast. Like thousands of years in a few decades fast.
It's incredibly polluted, but people are fooled because an invasive species known as the zebra muscle makes the water look extremely clear.
No, just really nasty. People have really grimed them up with all the garbage they leave/dispose of on the beach. I want to say the third most recent time my family went to visit a few there were even things like car tires among the usual trash.
[deleted]
Perhaps we should round up all the bureaucrats and put them in the pipes and feed them Nestle hot chocolate through their butts.

Win win!
The water treatment was the issue, not the polluted water from the flint river.
>Rush, Alex, Breitbart and Fox have killed their critical thinking skills.

Severely damaged but I don't think killed. My father will disagree with the truth and science all day if given to him on a platter but if I treat him like a child and lead him into coming to that conclusion himself without making it too obvious he more often than not can realize why something so-and-so on his favorite talk radio show is wrong.
It's the exact same thing as the left. You have Simone whatever the hell her name is on CNN every day that literally has nothing to say except for everyone is racist.  

I don't think people have any idea how little water that is... Michigan gets a hell of a lot of rain and all of our factories that have moved to Mexico and China tended to use a huge amount of water. People are amazingly ignorant. 

Funny that someone who posts on the libertarian sub is defending a unilateral decision made by the government over a community's wishes for how its resources are used. 
So? Why shouldn't they profit of their water? 
You shouldn't be getting downvoted, these are all legitimate questions. The issue I had is that the article is absolutely written to give a certain point of view on the subject, and therefore it should be read skeptically. People would have a right to be mad if Nestle only paid $200 for 210 million gallons, but I can't tell from the article if that includes taxes and whatnot, and whether or not the water is coming from public infrastructure or not. The article *does* say that their water source is classed as a private well, but I'm not sure what that means exactly. 

And to your last point: you're absolutely right that 210 million gallons isn't that much. It sounds like a lot, but I looked up water usage for Genesee County (Flint, since it's been mentioned so much in this thread), and if I'm reading the USGS data right, their water usage in 2010 was 12,000 million gallons, or 60 times what Nestle is getting here. I'm basing that number on "Domestic total self-supplied withdrawals and deliveries" in Genesee in 2010, which the USGS puts at 33 million gal/day. 

I'm all for companies having to pay their fair share for shit, and I know Nestle and others abuse the system as much as they can, but this doesn't seem like one of those abuses, at first glance.
Growing up I thought it was normal for dead fish and their bleached bones to line the shore!
I didn't downvote you. I never downvote people - I think it's kind of dumb. 
...everyone has their fetish I guess...
Oh yes, another dweller in the land of false equivalence!  

You get health coverage there?
My side is infallible, your side is wrong. 
That's pretty par on course for libertarians.
Your concerns are completely clueless. There's no shortage of water in the community. This additional pumping from nestle will not cause any damage to the surrounding community, therefore the NAP is completely intact.

Your statement that the government overruled a community's wishes is just as baseless as your concern about a water shortage in the god damn Great Lakes State.
Why shouldn't nestle profit off the water they own?
Thank you for your support. One other point to make is that of that 12 billion gallons used by the county, only a small percent is actually used for drinking water. Much is used to water lawns, wash cars and driveways, flush sewage, etc. While 100% of Nestle's water is for drinking purposes, the purpose of the Water is a Right movement. 
The healthcare I have now has me spending about ten grand this year to have a baby plus premiums. Not sure how much worse it can get. 
It's really scary how both sides are that way right now. It's seemingly  impossible to have an opinion counter to your chosen give mind. 
They are shockingly bad at being consistent. 
Look, if you're going to keep inventing things for me to say so you can argue against them, then you don't actually need my participation. Just reply to yourself and have fun. 
Did your state take the Medicare extension?  Mine didn't

Does your state only allow a couple of insurance companies to compete on the market for your policy?  Mine does, in fact, it allows the bigger of those health insurance companies to have a near monopoly AND it writes all the health protocols for the whole, entire, state.  The result is that you go to a normal health facility here and they treat you like a criminal before you dig a little deeper and find out that it's switched, secretly, to being an HMO so patients BE DAMNED!

Now I have insurance through a state in the northeast.  The difference is like night and day because they took the Medicare extension and they have dozens of insurance companies competing for the policies.
Nothing is made up. The community does not "rely on this source of water." That's a quote from you. That is because there's a bunch more water in the community. This is the great lakes state, not a desert. 

You've shown no actual evidence as to what the "community's wishes" are as to how this resource is used either. You've cited some people asking for public comment who went on to push for an article in the guardian, according to the article you cited. 

You have no idea what you're talking about, and you're going hard at it.


State in the northeast. Yes we took expansion. It sounds like poorly written legislation.  The only wonderful thing about it is the pre-existing condition changes. Relax with your outrage and sarcasm. 
Was neither outraged or sarcastic.  It was a straight post, since various people's experiences under the ACA interest me.
Honest question, what's wrong with vanillan in baby formula? I can understand complaints about the added sugar, but vanillan isn't sugar.
My mom has boycotted nestl√© since I was a kid. Never really understood it until I got older.
Worth noting that as recently as 2016, Nestle has admitted in court to using slave labor.  They don't change because its cheaper not to since they are the largest food supplier in the world and have a massively powerful lobby.
Nestle is pretty much the worst company ever when it comes to marketing their formulas. They killed babies in a few African countries in the 70s or 80s. It blows my mind that they are still in business but not that they continue to flout laws and regulations.
Of course. Nestle has shown time and time again that they won't let human health get in the way of profits. It should just be expected at this point.
How is no one in here not mentioning what they did in India? They had people dressed as fake nurses and telling people formula is better for their babies. They also control a ton of clean water there! Fuck this company they also own a fuck ton of stuff
This is coming from a corporation that says that having clean drinking water isn‚Äôt a human right .
When a company is too big to fail, they can commit atrocities like fucked up baby formula, child slavery, and selling bottled water back to the drought stricken community they stole it from, and the most punishment they get from it are small articles reminding the public that yes, Nestle continues to be evil, and still sees more profit in maintaining it. 

That's capitalism.  Buy local and avoid Nestle brands if/when you can.
What is wrong with vanillan flavouring? Does it have adverse health affects on infants?
Asked a US Regulatory person I know what their take on the story was:

>"Well, to be honest, infant formulas don‚Äôt always taste great, but in the US, flavorings are not permitted in infant formulas. I have never heard of a ‚Äúsucrose flavoring‚Äù but removing sucrose from a formula has its problems as well. It does help mask off-notes of the hydrolyzed protein products and also helps reduce the formation of browning products when the formula is heated during processing. Unfortunately, all people think of is added sugar to make babies drink more formula and that‚Äôs not why it is used. There are other good functional reasons for doing so."

&#x200B;

So it sounds like this is more of an International thing, but doesn't affect US infant products, if that's what anybody was wondering about.
I know we're all on the Nestle hate train, but lets not forget about Comcast.
Why is anyone surprised? Nestl√© is one of the most truly evil companies on this planet. Back in the 80s they used to promote baby formula in developing countries where clean water was almost impossible to come by. Even worse, they did it be giving free samples to new moms - just enough to last until the mom stopped lactating, leaving then with no choice but to buy formula and risk their baby's life by using potentially contaminated water.

Seriously, fuck Nestl√© - been boycotting them my whole life.
I misread that first as "villainy"

Considering it's Nestle, not too far off.
Nestle takes fresh spring water for free from where I live and gets tax breaks every year...

In western Canada, you only see nestle water bottles on the tourists. We hate this company.
This is the same nestle that think water isn't a human right and is instead there for a business to profit from and spend money promoting baby milk as "better than breast" in 3rd world countries until mums milk dries up so they can charge through the nose for the continued supply (all the while knowing it's generally made with compromised safety water supplies).  
Fuck Nestle.
I think exposing children to Van Halen at an early age is a good thing.
A real life Buy N Large from the Pixar universe.
 Abbot > Mead Johnson > Nestle, Gerber, etc.
>	Nestl√© continues to use science as merely a marketing tool, valuing higher profit margins over its scientific credibility.

r/LateStageCapitalism
I know this sounds crazy. But has nestle ever thought of making a formula that tastes like breast milk?
Farmers can add vanillin to feed to fatten up livestock.
[Doesn‚Äôt it come from a beavers anal gland?](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/beaver-butt-goo-vanilla-flavoring/)
Nestl√© is just a convenient cover for Satan‚Äôs dealings on Earth.
Because Nestle is evil.
In the running for the worst company on the planet
Not buying Nestl√© since 2010!
Used to work for their infant formula and feeding tube division as a lab tech. Their products are decent in terms of microbes. For the year and a half I was there, I never saw an infant formula with Salmonella or Enterobacter. They preach that breast feeding will never beat infant formula (which I believe they used to not do). Also, I see some comments saying they help with allergens. That is not entirely true as only our soy and some of the probiotic formulas have allergens
Nestl√© is self regulating
Nestle is a horrible company. They have no morals and couldn't give a shit about its customers so long as they are forking over cast for plastic bottles.
They also failed to stop using slave labour.  

A promise from Nestl√© is worthless.
Here is the simple solution: [http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestle-boycott-list](http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestle-boycott-list)
For a moment I though the headline read "Nestle has failed to remove vanilla from baby" and I was wondering... Why? Why was there vanilla in the baby? Why was Nestle removing it? Did the operation go wrong? What will happen to the vanilla baby? Very confused. Then I realized I'm a dumbass.
To the shock of no one
Don't buy anything from these evil motherfuckers.  Simple as that.
I really believe Nestle is one of, if not, the most evil company on our planet.
Why exactly are people buying anything from Nestle anymore? That company is a pile of shit
Nestle are slavers and all executives should be in prison for crimes against hummanity
Isn't Nestle the company that promoted privatizing clean water?
Vanillan is worse than vanilla.
Verily, the vanillan villain strikes again.
everyone: totally unsurprised
What‚Äôs wrong with vanilla?!
Is this just in Hong Kong or does it go by another name? I got free samples in the mail and don't see it listed in the ingredients.
Can‚Äôt be that hard to remove it..

wow. Who would have thought. US products can be just as sinister as chinese ones, if not more so.
*Insert Pok√©mon meme here*
And their chocolate is shit.
a Nestle representative had this to say on the matter...

"FUCK YOU POOR PEOPLE! WE'RE MUTHAFUCKIN NESTLE BITCHES!"
Not surprised, Nestl√© is a pretty shit company with no morals(go figure).
Nestle: "Yeah, well just be happy we don't lobby Congress to define breastfeeding as sexual so we can register women who refuse our products as sexual offenders."
I hate this headline and it's use of 'failed'. It gives you the idea that they somehow tried at all, but realistically they most likely never cared about it in the first place
stop buying nestl√© products. please.

they're assholes and they dont give a fuck about you.

this includes kit-kats and all these water bottle brands

https://www.nestle-watersna.com/en/bottled-water-brands
The trans-national that steals water from drought stricken people,  and makes use of slave labour is.. not. Ethical? Stop the fucking presses.
Who are vanillans and why are they a bad baby formula ingredient?
Fuck Nestle. So many of their practices are harmful to both the environment and the consumer. Right now in MI, one of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world, they're trying to buy up as much access to water as possible for exclusive private use.
Nestle has to be (by sheer reports I've read) one of  the most fucking evil corporation in our modern era.
I never buy Nestle products. It's a heartless company.
Nestle is a shit company that doesn't deserve to have you as a customer.
Nestle is a crime syndicate
Nestl√© has a proven track record of being pure garbage ethically. #NeverStopNeverStopping
Oh imagine that. Nestl√© is a shit company, dude.
I haven't bought nestle products for over 10 years and don't plan to anytime soon. Thankfully their range isn't as huge in my country as others.
Corporate promises are meaningless bullshit created by professional liers (PR workers).
It's almost as though women have some evolved trait that lets them feed the baby themselves.
Get one of the board of directors and execute them. Add the cost of the execution to whatever fine they're due. Eventually they'll get the message.
The last time I gave up KitKats, someone died. I can't do it again or else my pet frog will drown a barrel of black oil after hopping out of my shirt pocket.
Reminder- nestle is hordes of individuals "just doing their job." Anything for money.
So what would a small-time company be hit with if they attempted this sort of false advertising?
What?  A corporation lied?!?  My whole world is shaken to its core‚Ä¶
Nestle being horrible? Who woulda thought?
Fuck nestle! Look on the back of everything you buy for their little sneaky name. Nestle makes too much shit. The only way to fight this shit is by not buying it!
Why the fuck is anyone buying Nestle to begin with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWULCfJ2PGA
Nestle is one of the most evil companies out there. Weird how it doesn‚Äôt come up more.
I like my baby formula with extra vanilan.
There is research to show that vanilla flavourings induce infants to drink more, and it has an impact on later food-related behaviours. In addition it has little to no nutritional value which makes you wonder if they are adding it in specifically to make the babies drink more.

\*vanillin, and it's unnecessary flavouring and can cause sensitisation to vanillin meaning later allergy like reactions plus it can cause migraines.

It's not really a problem for anyone but infants, so there's no reason to stop vanilla flavour from existing, but it's simply not necessary in these Nestl√© products. Human milk doesn't contain vanillin anyway.

Plus there's some hints that there may be other development related problems, but those aren't well understood yet.

Basically vanillin has no place in infant formula anyway, so why keep it inside?
Might as well toss some nicotine in there too
They prefer chocolate
Why introduce chemicals to a child who probably doesn't even care about flavors, less artificial ones? Also alot of Vanilla is synthesized using the anus of the beaver. Think about that for a moment.
Doesn‚Äôt it come from a beaver‚Äôs anal gland?
I've been boycotting them for the last few years.

it's next to fucking impossible to get bottled water.

or a lot of things for that matter.
My mum did her midwifery dissertation on Nestle and the way they pushed formula in 3rd world countries, to the point that mother's own milk dried up, then they stopped supplying the formula milk and left. Leaving thousands of children starving, dying, unprotected and with no way out. No nestle in our house....

Aren't all iPhones made with slave labor?
My guess is that here they're just using up their excess inventory and dumping it in a non-Western market, like Hong Kong.
Looks like you awakened that lobby here the replies are painful to read
What astounds me is just how much of the baby market they dominate. I have an 11 month old and we have made sure not to use any Nestl√© products for him (or us, for that matter) but when you start investigating you realise just how enormous their market share is.
In India they pushed powdered formula as being better than breastmilk for babies. Problem was, and they knew this, most didn't have access to clean enough water, which made formula dangerous. When mothers stopped breastfeeding their milk ducts dried up, so there was no going back.
They are currently buying up fresh water reserves wherever they can. They're looking to cash in on steadily worsening drought and lack of clean water. They're pretty much literally super villains at this point.
~~They didn't just kill babies, they sold tainted formula (HIV I think) to Africans rather than destroying it, simply because they knew the regulations there wouldn't prevent it while in more developed countries they would.~~   
  
Edit:  As another poster mentioned, this was Bayer not Nestle.  Nestles scandals are numerous and awful, but they didn't deliberately infect people with HIV.

I would gladly do IT for their offices if it meant providing me the means to have my own home.
Because they own a [ridiculous](https://www.nestle.com/brands/brandssearchlist) amount of shit and it's easy to buy something they make without realizing it.
I would assume it also makes babies prefer it over breast milk. Watched a documentary 20 years ago about how they pressured women to think that only poor people breast fed thus getting them hooked on formula that they couldnt afford and by that time their mild dries up. So awful.
Yikes. It's almost as if they're conditioning them to, in the future, buy more Nestle products. That's atrocious.
Nestle is competing with Monsanto ‚óáBayer‚óá to be the worst company on the planet.
Perfect! Thank you!
dumbass here... would it be bad to induce infants to drink more?
Can you provide a source for this? 

An easy counter argument would be that vanilla tastes good and that's the reason it's added. I'm not saying that's the case but I'd like to check out the research your comment is referring to.
If you have a formula fed baby that is not eating enough, then wouldn‚Äôt this be a helpful ingredient?
Vanillan tastes nice... Its literally vanilla flavouring...
Will a company that wants to privatize all the drinkable water on earth and does so by stealing it and reselling to the public put addictive substances in your baby formula?
Of course they are. Follow the money.
Nestle? Doing something predatory? I don‚Äôt believe it!!! /s
This is just so freaking consciously bankrupt...
So it makes the baby drink more and the parents buy more, it's just smart business. They would be dumb to take it out.
Well, duh, probably. They also probably have a huge amount of the stuff just wasting away and they're probably hoping to get rid of what's left before they do much.

Note, neither of these reasons are very good, but they are reasons.
I know you‚Äôre kidding - for my toddler we added cereal (the powder type) to the formula so the kid would get his night snack and feel full till the morning. You just make the nipple hole a bit bigger.
> *vanillin

 Not sure why you "corrected" them 7 hours later, when they actually spelled it correctly.
You joke but sugar/sweets are shown to have an opiate like effect in infants. Hell, when infants are circumcised, they give them a pacifier dipped in jelly (I believe the name for it in hospitals is sweet-eez )
Don't stop there, just rub a little bit of Gran's white powder on their gums.
There are lots of bottled water alternatives that can help improve taste and safety! Don't buy it at all if you can help it!
[So many things.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands) 

Worth it, though. I haven‚Äôt bought a pint of Haagen-Dazs or a box of Nerds in years.
Might be spoiled because I'm from Sweden, but why would you need to buy bottled water if you live in a developed country? If we want bubbly water we take tap water and carbonate it with our Soda stream.
They own Lean Cuisine.  One of the only brands of frozen food that has items that don't make me sick (either from texture or ingredients).  I freaking hate that I give them money but I need to have easy to prepare meals for when my health conditions act up or else I can't eat.  I ONLY buy when they go on sale for $2 or less each.  Often layering another coupon ontop.
A lot of these women were simply given the formula without instructions, and couldn't read the instructions on the pack either. This lead to them making the milk either far too strong or too weak too.
This was the kicker for us to boycott. When I had my son it became clear how unconscionable those marketing strategies were / are.
Let's be real though, Nestle isn't very interested in knowing if there is slave labor being used in the production of their products unless they think there is a chance the information will become public. They'll happily put pressure on suppliers to get the lowest price possible and won't look too hard into how that happens because it is convenient for them to not know and have plausible deniability. 

Nestle could ensure much better conditions for anyone in their entire supply chain if they cared too.
Yea nestle gives 0 fucks
My wife does this, her job title is material compliance. She says it‚Äôs stressful and sometimes saddening.
There are degrees, and the truth is, that with the slightest effort, you can absolutely find ethical supply chain friendly companies that fulfill every need that nestle offers.  It costs more, sometimes, but places like ALDI help diminish those changes in cost while keeping a responsible supply chain.  Moreover, Nestle mostly deals in shit food which most people could cut out of their lives entirely and probably just increase their health.  I mean frozen pizzas are doing no one any favors.  

Sure, there are dangers of slave labor in a lot of industries to a horrifying degree (virtually any brand of textiles is just tragically bad.) but most companies are able to discover and address those issues when they pop up, eliminating what they can.  Nestle has the same issue over and over again and it persists largely because they do almost nothing to deal with it.  Hell, what they admitted to in 2016 was just an unaddressed issue from 2008 that they had taken no steps to address since then.
start throwing executives in prisons, real prisons not white collar ones, for life and that shit will get changed real fast
Capitalism is the problem.

You‚Äôre downvoted but I can‚Äôt imagine the normal citizen coming into a Reddit thread ‚ÄúUH ACKCHUALLY EVERY COMPANY USES SLAVE LABOR.‚Äù Pretty sure everyone I have ever met would just say yeah fuck them. Reddit threads are full of shills now and it‚Äôs not a secret.
I s2g it‚Äôs like playing whack a mole with dog food‚Äîthey keep buying out companies almost faster than we can keep up with.
I try to avoid Nestle too. The major conglomerates are everywhere. It‚Äôs kind of absurd. :-/
Yup. I recently found out my favorite baby soap had been bought by Nestle and they just recently changed the bottles to indicate. Obviously it was time to switch but it sucks they own so much now.
I worked at Abbott for a short time. They make similac and ensure. They also make the generic Kirkland brand similac baby formula. It‚Äôs possible to avoid any one particular company with enough research. But then if you want to boycott multiple companies for various reasons you might be in trouble.
Yeah. It's an example (IMO) of why these massive companies need to be broken up in to more controllable units.
Yup.  Gerber(owned by nestle) is everywhere and everyone buys that crap for my kids too because it's such a household name.  I am constantly telling people to not buy those products for us as I will just throw them away.  

Personally, store brands are just as good if not better then what nestle sells.
It is pretty shocking.

When I think Nestle I think Nestea, I think sugar, I think of all the unhealthy crap they produce. Nestle would be the last company I'd turn to if I was raising a baby.

Although sadly companies like CocaCola and Nestle just buy out pretty much every other things these days so more often than not people won't even realise it.
I'm glad we were able to breastfeed. We didn't do baby food either, kid didn't want it he just kept reaching for what we ate. Why the fuck is baby food a thing? You can buy applesauce and stuff to transition them, that phase they are still on milk/formula and are using baby food to learn to eat, it's otherwise just mashed food. Now diapers and wipes... I don't know eho owns those brands but I am sure it is one of the big ones, and the others (like natural brands) suck bad.
So true. They own [Gerber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands), among other things.
It's a huge pain in the ass. They own a lot of the most common pet food brands, too.
Pretty much the same thing happened in Africa.
They did this in Africa as well, give new mothers a sample pack of formula. Mothers didn't have access to clean water, high risk of babies getting diseases from untreated water. Sample pack was only long enough for the milk ducts to dry up. 

Many of the mothers were well intentioned but under educated and blindly trusted the medical staff to give them the best advice. Forcing the mothers to give diluted formula babies to make things even worse

Yeah, I think the original commenter was referring to the "Nestl√© Kills Babies" controversy of the 1970s. Business Insider has a good rundown of the details:
https://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6
you know you are on reddit when....

&#x200B;

the HIV tainted scandal was Bayer, not Nestle.
Do you have a source on that? Haven't heard that before.
Not the first attempt at the formula switcheroo, where they accidentally killed the potential market.
Yes we can
Just as an FYI, link to your first article is dead, and the other article you‚Äôve linked appears to be behind a paywall. 

I‚Äôm actually pretty curious about vanillin in infant formula, but so far finding no actual studies on its effect?
Thanks, quite revealing. The only reason to add vanillin is to get babies hooked. That is just vile.
Because clearly there‚Äôs only one other option than poorly regulated capitalism. Pretty well reasoned and not at all disingenuous argument you got there.
Yes. All of them. It‚Äòs even harder to keep track of it when you travel, because they own different brands in different countries. For example KitKat is owned by H. B. Reese (Hershey) in the US, but in the rest of the world it‚Äôs owend by Nestl√©.
Thank you for the additional context.
Yeah this is complete talking point PR horseshit.  They buy millions of gallons of water from municipalities for chump change and try to act like the "water you need for survival is a human right."

Okay?  So stop buying all our fucking water and selling it back to us.  Nestle isn't a water company.  They have nothing to do with the infrastructure that runs water to people's houses.  He has been trying to backpeddle from this statement ever since he was stupid enough to make it on camera, a rare moment of sociopathic honesty.
The fact that he sang a little folk song about the 'cattle' needing water during the water video lets me know everything I need to know about the man and the company.      
        
Don't give your money to these guys.
I thought about that when I was typing, I should check more often.
My wife and I were told about this when we attended the hospital run breastfeeding classes when my first son was born. They told us how there was a time that moms were told breast milk is no where as good as the engineered formulas. But it‚Äôs bullshit because of all the healthy anti-bodies they get. There is a reason a breastfeeding infant will not get the sick if the mom got it and fought it off.
I heard about that. And since they couldn't afford enough of the formula, they watered it down to make it last longer. It resulted in sickly babies, brain damage, and infant mortality.
Not just that, but the idea of giving your baby a bottle must have been incredibly liberating. I'm currently BFing my 7 month old and holy shit is this a commitment. I am tethered to either my child or my pump and can not go long periods of time without attaching to one of them. Of course I understand the health and bonding benefits so that's why I do it. But if it's true that even doctors were recommending it, I completely understand women being willing to give in to formula.
another problem is if women don't breastfed every so often their bodies stop producing breast milk. it was one of nestle's strategies in poor countries. they would give away free formula enough so that the mothers would stop producing breast milk. then they were forced to use formula from then on. worse yet because access to clean water in those countries are limited it resulted in a lot of dead babies. nestle knew it would happen and did it anyway. when it came to light and people brought it up nestle ignored them and kept doing it anyway. i think at one point they deducted the free formula they gave away from their taxes as charity or some shit.
Not to mention all the children that died due to malnutrition when moms started rationing the formula. Not like they had much of a choice at that point. They stopped producing. They can't afford to buy the volume of product they need. Poor mothers slowly killed their children all for trying to do what they believed was superior to breastfeeding. That's what they were being sold by Nestle and many crooked salesmen, I mean doctors.
Nestle killed a lot of babies in developing countries by pretending to be doctor's stating that formula was better for the children.
I think this is still being pushed in other countries today.
My grandmother believed that! Fortunately my mom fell in with hippies before she met my dad.
They are conditioning them to, in the future, buy more Nestle products.
As bad as Monsanto is, I feel like they hardly hold a candle to the outright and genuine evil that Nestle performs.
Not competing, symbiosis.
Monsanto uses a really shitty system to fuck farmers over, but GMO's are a great thing.
Didn't Nestle cause a lot of infant deaths in India?

Also, I thought Nestle was depleting fresh water streams by installing bottling plants that use all of the streams' water, leaving none to flow downstream.
If the baby is hungry it will eat. Don't need to form addictive habits (eating for the sake of taste) before they can even talk.
Ok I am not sure on this myself but I think formula fed babies do run the risk of being overfed where breastfed babies generally don't - this is what they told me as a breastfeeding mom. Maybe manufacturing the milk in such a way as to make babies drink more if it is a way to sell more formula and make more money?
Makes a habit of overeating in the future. We already have a problem with obesity, and Nestle is knowingly making it worse because they want to sell a little more formula.
Ehh...yes and no. Drinking from a bottle is easier and thus often faster then from a boob. Babies have a need or strong desire to suckle on something. If your baby downs his or her bottle in say 5 minutes the sucking need isn't yet satisfied. So if you don't pay attention you run the risk of overfeeding your bottle fed baby because it wants to suckle and that looks like baby is hungry so let's give more... boom, overfed baby. In which case, making the formula even tastier is not exactly a good thing. Besides you'll encourage baby to get used to a certain flavour that they're then more likely to crave later in life, thus encouraging them to buy vanilla flavoured crap.
That's not a counter-argument. That is the argument.
Read your comment again. You are claiming the same thing.
Also would love to see some sources on these claims.
You really don't see the problem with encouraging babies to eat more in a society that already has a *massive* weight problem? Seriously?
Things babies apperently care about.
That's not often a problem (for long). Some babies resist formula especially if transitioning from breastmilk, but as a whole formula fed babies are easily & too often overfed. That's because of many factors (most of them caregiver related), but to add in a baby that wants to taste *more* formula? 

Considering that a couple ozs of milk a day is about 40 calories, and a 10 lb baby needs about 450 calories a day, that's almost 9% extra calories.  This sets the baby up for excessive weight gain which strongly increases their chances of obesity later in life.
My girlfriend and I recently made the switch to reusable bottles and the change in our waste output has already been dramatic.
They even have Starbucks?!
Not all tap water in the U.S. is fit for human consumption.  Don't confuse the U.S. with a developed nation. It wants the world to think it is, without actually providing said development to its residents.
In many places here the tap water is awful, like in my town it has had high lead levels for like 4 years straight, high enough to cause lead poisoning. We get a notice every 4 mos telling us it is still a problem and not to drink it.
It‚Äôs a really big country, and providing that sort of development isn‚Äôt at the top of everyone‚Äôs lost.
I live in maine, horrible snow storms have knocked out power for days or even weeks at a time. so having basic survival stuff on hand is usually a good idea.

also good to keep water in your car in case you break down somewhere isolated.
Also, the water available to make it with was never guaranteed to be clean or even available depending on where they were. The whole thing shocked me when mum told me about it, I've personally been brought up anti-formula as she's a midwife anyway...But this sort of big business greed is disgusting, and absolutely unforgivable.
Good for you - it takes a strong stance to send a message to companies like this.
Then why did they do the research themselves and released the report?
And keep in mind that Nestle is better than most of the big food companies out there. If you find out about a problem at Nestle, assume it's way worse at their competitors.
Sure. Give a bunch of money to the guy who owns the farms. I‚Äôm sure trickle down economics will come into play.

She deserves a lot of credit for her work.
Same.  My wife works in supply chain.
Aldi has some tasty frozen pizzas, including ones with lots of vegetables.
/u/KarlAtWork is clearly not Karl Marx. If you have 200 acres and your purchaser is buying 10,000 tonnes of product and the independent supply chain auditors show up and you have 1/10th the workforce needed to harvest that, they're not going to have to prove anything ‚Äî they're going to mark you down as a risk and report it up the chain. Purchasers exert enormous power and if they take it seriously they can absolutely regulate illegal practices ‚Äî in fact there's a solid argument they are better at this kind of regulation than governments. It's harder when they are buying product from open markets, where products can be mixed, but a lot of major food conglomerates don't work like that. But this only happens when consumers and governments regulate the conglomerates, i.e. when we *don't* let Nestl√© off the hook by saying 'it's just difficult to eradicate completely.'
For something that happened in another country and that they were only tangentially involved in? And that most likely didn't actually break any laws in this country? I know reddit loves to hate the rich, but it's not like CEOs are in the sweatshops cracking whips and chopping off hands.
Capitalism isn't the problem. Lax regulations are the problem. Given the current state of politics in the country, the best course of action is to make them pay. I googled a quick list of items made by Nestle, noticed the ones I buy or might purchased, and committed that to memory. Will no longer buy those products. Going to tell friends and family. Not much, but it's something.
Sure is, just that every system is infinitesimally worse.

I stayed at home with both of my children, so I never ran into this/don't know how prevalent it is. But I have heard some people say that their daycares would only accept store bought baby food (home made not being allowed for supposed safety or hygienic reasons).
Baby food is a thing because it helps infants learn how to eat (the mechanical process), exposes them to allergens (now the prevailing theory is that early exposure reduces allergies later), and exposes them to new flavors and textures to be less picky eaters later in life. A lot of babies have a window of time between being able to chew and swallow "mashed" food and when it is recommended to introduce them to foods, so the result is baby food (pureed).

&#x200B;

Why the fuck is pre-packaged baby food a thing? Because babies get hungry on the go, parents have other stuff to do besides making baby food, and it keeps longer. My baby would NOT eat meats except the pre-packaged ones because the texture (I wasted a lot of time and money steaming and pureeing organic, free range meats!). It helped him transition into eating table food to get used to the taste first, then move on to texture. Now he is 9 months old eating off the table which would not have happened if not for pre-packaged baby food.
"Why aren't all babies exactly like my anecdotal experience...?"
Shhhh, don't let Big Diaper hear you bro, they'll send someone to break your legs so you'll have to use diapers too.
There isn't even anything to gain from doing that either.
Fuel for boiling water is difficult in the villages. Rajasthan for example is mostly arid, firewood hard to gather. Many villages still burn mostly dried cow dung, because it still has a high moisture content, it's very smokey and a lot of the ash gets into the water. In the cities, the poor often burn whatever scrap paper or wood they can find. 

Those that can afford it will use propane or CNG tanks.
It might be a case of babies having weaker immune systems.  Like how in many countries locals can drink the water but tourists can't.  It might not occur to the mother that the water might be unsafe for the baby, because they drink it themselves.
Ahh, well I did say I wasn't positive.  Thanks for the correction.  I will edit my post.
I had the wrong company.  Another poster corrected me and pointed out I was thinking of Bayer, not Nestle.  
  
Nestle has done many awful things, but they didn't do that... when so many companies commit crimes against humanity it's easy to get them mixed up.
Same. I have a 3 month old i am desperate to wean off the breast due to severe pain related complications for me. And he cannot stand the taste of most formulas and it is very stressful for the whole family. Breastmilk has a sugar in it. We finally found Alimentum Ready to Feed formula by Abbott. The baby takes it. I am eternally grateful for it. I am a little saddened / turned off by the fact that sugar is literally the second ingredient in the formula. After water. üò• Soooo in my mind, anything that doesn‚Äôt cause REAL damage to my baby and contains all nutrients and any and every identified component of breast milk possible - but gets him to eat it - is something I would buy.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I think it was more a comment on the subreddit linked above.  If you're going to name drop a controversial subreddit, you should be prepared to defend it.
My parents were of the "formula is engineered by science, therefore must be the best" camp.  When I had my baby, I decided to breastfeed because of the benefits for the baby. They even bought me formula shortly after she was born, and my dad had told my husband that formula was best and we should formula feed our daughter. 

When she was about 3 months old, my husband and I both had bad colds for a week. Men tend to act way sicker (man colds), so while he moped around and napped, I had to do all the baby duties, wake 3/4 times a night, do all grocery shopping with the baby, and make all meals for the family... Needless to say, I had a really rough week. Amazingly, although I felt like crap and snot tissues were all over the house, my daughter never got sick. She still hasn't had a sick day at 8 months old. I originally had a goal of 6 months, but now I intend to breastfeed her until she's 1. :)
I wonder if anti-vaxers know this and will stop breast feeding as the breast milk is acting as a proxy vaccine.
Only humans ... will deny their offspring their *own* milk, while joyfully feeding them either chemical crap like formula and/or drink copious amounts of other animals‚Äô milk while marketing its nutritional properties to each other.

#Facepalm
Also if you use powder and mix it at higher than recommended concentration it can cause liver and kidney issues.
Ahh the tax deduction clears up my confusion. You overvalue your formula at western marketprice, throw out essentially cents woth of product at people who can't sue you and deduct it as charity. 

It's likely not much about the broke women buying formula after they have no other choice, but taxes they can safe by pretending it's worth a lot more than it is. Their dependance is just an added bonus because the target group is so big and they can move on as soon as possible.

Lethal combination of no conscious, complete greed and real determination.
Well that explains it...
Then there is the whole round up thing... agent orange thing... Monsanto is bad. I say this as a Missourian who sees them everywhere.
No not Monsanto the gmo company. Monsanto-Bayer the chemical company that supplied the poison gas for Hitler and hid the cancer risk of agent orange so we would spray it directly over the troops in Vietnam.
Ah yes, this often repeated reddit gem. How exactly do you think Monsanto fucks over farmers?
They demand water rights so they can sell it back to people for money, and also creating massive amounts of single use plastic waste.
I think it‚Äôs a matter of bottle feeding vs nursing than formula vs breastmilk. Assuming you have bad oversupply, I think it‚Äôs still possible to overfeed a baby using pumped bm, particularly when they‚Äôre just starting to drift off.

Just from personal experience, if she‚Äôs using me as a paci then she doesn‚Äôt get much milk when she‚Äôs sucking more shallowly. If there‚Äôs a bottle in her mouth, she‚Äôll drink somewhere between 1-3oz before she fully knocks out, even when drinking exactly the same way.

That being said, per my ped, in order to get her to drink more, I should add a drop or two of non-alcoholic vanilla flavoring to her milk. Yeah...that‚Äôs a great way for us to waste a bottle of milk. 

Also, I would *love* for them to figure out a way to make alimentum/nutramigen* taste better. Right now that stuff tastes the same way cat food smells.

*edit: I know they don‚Äôt make either but pretty much those equivalents in other brands tend to taste about the same
that is completely logical too.  but I imagine if the baby didnt want to drink the formula, that would be bad for everyone.

&#x200B;

dont know the solution.
is this speculation or fact?  does overeating as an infant actual cause obesity?  are infants fed nestle formula found to grow up with weight issues?
Why wouldn't a baby care about how food tastes? It's in our evolution, more tasty = more calories, which is necessary for survival.
See, in Germany tap water is drinkable most of the time, so the only time we buy bottled water is sparkling, and even then we have a Sodastream/Sodaclud device that allows us to put bubbles in tap water. So for my family, the only bottled water we buy is the occasional bottle for use in our car, when there's no tap nearby. Also, we have Pfand on german bottles (not sure what the english word is) that prevents most bottles from being littered, as they are worth basically a quarter (plastic bottles and cans, glass bottles are 8ct).
Yes, it's a crazy amount of waste when you add it up. Some of my neighbors have recycling bins nearly full of bottles every week, and of course most of that doesn't actually get recycled now that China has stopped accepting our recyclables. Most places have safe water, even if it doesn't always taste that great, and in those cases there are reasonably priced filters for individual bottles, pitchers, refrigerators, large jugs, faucets, showerheads, and even your entire house. The true safety hazards are the vast minority.
Nestle has a perpetual [license](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2018/05/07/nestle-and-starbucks-do-a-deal-but-will-it-work-in-the-long-term/amp/) to distribute, market, and sell Starbucks products outside of Starbucks stores. They do not own Starbucks. So if you purchase a coffee from a Starbucks store, that does not directly profit Nestl√©.
Hell, there are people in Appalachia without indoor plumbing.
> Not all tap water in the U.S. is fit for human consumption.

That sentence is just... wow.. I can't comprehend it. In Sweden, all water that comes out of a tap is drinkable. I'd be dead within a week if I were to visit the US.
You still have lead pipes or are your water treatment plants just awful? In Sweden we have at least 100 times less traces of lead in our drinking water that what is considered to be the safe limit. Even those of us that have our own wells do not have a problem with lead in our water. This is so mind blowing for me.
Clean drinking water should be at the top of everyone's list when it comes to a developed country. Sad to hear that it is like this in the states, I thought they'd be more... developed.
It's awful. On paper it sounds like they're doing something good, provding 3rd world mothers with formula. In practice however, it seems like some sick and twisted prank on these poor women and children... I can't see any other explanation for why it would still be this bad after all this time.
Because they've been under pressure on this topic for many years and wanted to get ahead of it.
\>   They'll happily put pressure on suppliers to get the lowest price possible 

It's truly absurd the number of times people assume that corporations do these kinds of things out of the goodness of their heart. It's either CYA or there is a way to make money and if you don't see that then you aren't looking and then you are asking others to explain to you how business works...

&#x200B;

Wtf people... there is no such thing as business ethics... weather you are Amazon, Chick-fil-a, Nestle, or Facebook -- they do most everything they do primarily for profit reasons (and yes being closed on Sunday can actually increase your profits -- it's called pandering)
Hey out of here with your logic man we want to be angry
A lot of times the people in charge are in those positions because they WILL look the other way.
No.

That's probably why I'm a peon and not Top Brass at an international conglomerate with a history of downright sociopathic behavior.

It's not pessimistic, it's just not naive.
Maybe we have that view of Nestle based on their other actions? Like their basically stealing water from communities
Nestle has a long, long history of shitty business practices. I %100 believe they look the other way when it saves them money.
No, that's the point - Nestle is evil. It's not a view of humanity in general, it's a view of Nestle in specific.
Most people aren't sociopaths, so they would never end up in the position to begin with. It's pessimistic, but it's 100% accurate. Palmolive ring a bell?
If you throw a piece of carrot on top of a bowl of ice cream, it cancels out the calories and sugar. Facts.
I really don't care, their supply chain is also something that they need to be held responsible for. it doesn't matter what you do to underlings or fines, it wont ever be more worth it to at best turn a blind eye to whats going on. you have to punish the people at the top.
Of course it's worth noting that the former begets the latter. They do kinda go hand in hand.
[Good luck with that.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Collaborative_Services_v._Prometheus_Laboratories,_Inc.)  You'd better remind your doctor, as well.

They literally tried to get a patent for determining if the dosage for a drug is correct.  Nestl√© gives zero fucks, unless it makes them more money.
Ideological moral capitalism is a great idea. In reality, free market capitalism is in fact a failed system.

 We are in late stage capitalism, where our environmental protection agency is run by exon mobile and we have a billionaire POTUS

Like capitalism itself is not the problem, but capitalism fails for the same reason every other system fails 

(Greed and corruption)
Capitalism buys their own regulations globally. This is how we have Nestle stealing water and using slave labour while everyone lines up and ignores this to buy their unethical consumption.  There are like 6 corporations that own literally everything.
They just bought Orijen and Acana, which is super irritating because that was the high value food I would mix in with my dog‚Äôs normal stuff when she started feeling *~fancy~*. They also own Purina (which covers Alpo, Friskies, Beneful, Fancy Feast etc) and Merrick (Castor and Pollux, Whole Earth Farms).

Edit: My mistake‚Äî/u/hooterscadoo pointed out Nestle are just negotiating a buyout. Helpful reminder to pay attention to the type of language used in speculative articles.
It actually creates less competition instead of more... so they essentially monopolize markets all over.
Not true. Store brands are made by Perrigo...not Nestle

https://www.perrigo.com/business/formula.aspx
Mmm, I guess it depends on the store then.  For instance, I shop at target now because Kroger doesn‚Äôt accept my Visa card anymore.  Both stores own brands are not made by Nestle.

Can you drop what store brands Nestle manufactures so I know in the future?
On the go we were feeding him bottles until he was weaned. We used meal times for focusing on solids. From talking to people in different countries baby food is more an American thing. I don't think it's bad because all kids are different and some are naturally picky, so no judge, but overall I think parents default to it. We felt like we had to do baby food but when our kid refused we realized it's just food, there was nothing wrong with table food that was the same consistency.
Maybe was a hit strongly worded. I know some kids get finicky but you would think babies can only eat baby food when reaply they can eat any soft food. Baby food is fucking expensive and hardly necessary
Think you might misunderstand because I didn't write it clearly. The poor can't afford to buy sufficient formula, so they dilute it to and malnourish their babies.

You weren't.... HIV positive?
Wishing you the best in your weaning journey! Fed is absolutely best, and your physical and mental health are so important. 

I‚Äôm still breastfeeding, but we did use Alimentum for a bit when we suspected a milk allergy. I remember it smelling so strongly.
Although it's unanimous that "breast is best" my wife cried and cried when she couldn't produce enough breast milk with our new born. And it's not like we didn't try. We went to lactation meetings every other day, tried hand express, used the pump religiously, bought lactation cookies, bought the pills and did the yeast thing. Nothing worked.

We eventually had to switch over to Formula and now breastfeeding is more comfort for our daughter. At 7 months after giving birth, my wife only produces a few drops here and there, but my daughter is very much attached to breast feeding even now. It helps soothe her and she's most comfortable at the breast.

My daughter has had runny noses, but she's never had a fever or been sick yet. And she's been to lots of family gatherings so far. (During the winter might I add). So I don't necessarily think primarily formula fed babies are at a disadvantage. But that's just through my own experience. I'm not a Doctor.
I was breastfeeding my baby for the first 6 months, then I noticed that he hadn't been hit by a car in those 6 months, I've been breastfeeding him for 16 years and he still hasn't been hit by a car!
[Here's an article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/man-flu-really-thing-2018010413033) on the "man cold" you mentioned.

Men actually do respond worse to flu and cold symptoms and are generally sicker, with longer recovery periods.

It's not an *act* at all.
I'm sure that subtle sexist remark was completely necessary.
> Men tend to act way sicker (man colds)

That's some sexist bs right there.
>Men tend to act way sicker 

Men are so weak, they can't even get sick right. They even act like they die younger & suffer way more injuries while they work much longer hours at more dangerous jobs.  [http://time.com/4683864/men-sick-cold-flu/](http://time.com/4683864/men-sick-cold-flu/)
The "man flu"  has more to do with immune systems than how men act. Women's immune systems are stronger so they handle it better but it's also why they get more autoimmune disorders.
*Formula has electrolytes*
Not to butt in but just wanted to mention that getting sick is good for the baby‚Äôs immune system. A recent study linked germ free childhoods to an increased risk of childhood leukemia. [Specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.](https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/05/22/health/leukemia-clean-childhood-study-intl/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)

We lost my cousin this way and though I would never dare to share this info with her or any of her close family members, I think it is something worth knowing if you have kids.
It's all in genetics. I RARELY saw my dad sick. I RARELY get sick, maybe once every 2 to 3 years and I'll get a quick 1 day cold when i do.  Both my daughters were formula fed growing up, due to them not being able to latch on. They both rarely get sick. My older daughter is 9 and is at the top of her class. My 2 year old is constantly full of energy where i can barely keep up. When she does get sick, it's for a day, maybe two, tops. Everyone is different. Science may speak for a majority but it can't speak for everybody. I don't care what anyone else does with their body or their kid. If it works, it works. By the way, I'm not a anti vaccine either. I don't know how much that plays a role.
Fun fact: when you or your baby is sick your breast milk takes on a slightly more blue hue as it contains more anti-bodies to help your child fight off the sickness.
Men don't tend to act sicker, that's just your husband
All three of my kids are breast fed and never get sick.
Yes but many other mammals will kill or abandon the weakest of their offspring when they realise there will likely not be enough milk for them all.
I am heartbroken that you did not reply to that comment by saying "oh ok thx".
Their business practices are absolutely awful, but many of their products seriously benefit the world.  Water resistant crops, better crop yields, less food waste.  
  
Now, there are ways to do some of this stuff without needing all of the chemicals they create but that's not viable everywhere.  Monsanto, and companies like them are eventually going to eliminate food scarcity in the world.  
  
Basically, they do very good work, but they go about selling their products in unethical ways.
Because of the way they force exclusivity to use their products.  At best it's an anti competitive practice.  Once you sign with them, it is very, very hard to get away from them even once it's no longer sufficiently profitable to do business with them.
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but didn't they create a wonderful seed that they licensed to farmers to use? GREAT! Then didn't they sue any farmer where that seed was found even if it was just blown onto their farm basically forcing every farmer to use their seed or face constant lawsuits? So basically if any neighboring farm within the distance a seed could travel by wind had their seeds, you had to buy their seeds. I remember watching a documentary about this years ago, but am admittedly no expert.

Edit, according to this single article, which is the extent of google energy I have for this topic, it wasn't as bad as it was made out to be

Maybe most Germans just don't care about the environment?
Yup, I went to school with a few people without indoor plumbing...& that was not too long ago.
It's not just that our tap sources aren't consistently good. The pipes people get their water through have been there in some cases for over a century. In many cases, at least decades.

What do you figure the state of those pipes is like? What do you reckon a lot of them are made of? Would it surprise you to learn most pipes prior to the seventies contain lead? And that a great deal of them are corroding now?

20 years of being at war while trying not to distress rich people with higher taxes, means that clean water, good public education and services for the people of our democracy have taken a back seat.
How much money can you even make exploiting those women? It's evil alright but it's also petty. They damage and kill babies for an insignificant fraction of their revenue.
Can we stop with these comments? They aren't funny or original anymore reddit please let it die.

And lets not forget convincing new mothers in impoverished countries that their formula was better than breastmilk, causing millions of babies to starve after the free samples ran out and their mothers could no longer produce breastmilk.
Wasn‚Äôt that a green dishwashing liquid that made your hands nice and soft rather than hard and leathery if you did a lot of dishes?
one of the best pieces dietary advice I ever received was "You can't make food more diet friendly by adding to it."
If you put peppers, mushrooms and onions on a pizza instead of sausage and pepperoni, and eat the same total amount, that's better for you. Fact.
I thought if you ate 2 servings, they cancelled each other out?
While seeking profits is the motivation, the way they get less regulations isn't because of capitalism. The problem is that corporations run washington and reduce regulations to maximize profits, at the cost of the health of the nation. It isn't a straight line, a number of countries in the EU have capitalism, and strict regulations because they have tough lobbying and campaign finance reform.
Exactly. You can't trust people to act in good faith for the benefit of others. It doesn't take many people in the wrong positions to fuck it all up. 

Regulations, Taxes, checks and balances, and all that stuff are our friends for all those reasons. Just... you know... still the issue of more greed and corruption > <

People have been burning dried cow dung as fuel for centuries.

Even in the American south-west, a lot of the Spanish missions were built with adobe bricks, which was often dirt with a high clay content mixed with a cob like dung or straw.
Thanks! Breast milk is definitely better than formula. It‚Äôs the truth. (So Rock on, girlfriend!) And I‚Äôm ok with that. But yes, physical and mental health kinda trump that.   This whole experience has been quite the whirlwind. And I wish baby would take the NeuroPro because it seems better for his development than the Alimentum ... but he hates the taste. And I tasted it myself - it is gross, lol. Alimentum is a little sweeter - like BM. Gosh the things I have done and that I know. Weird. Never really saw this in my cards. Haha.
If your wife can't produce...she can't produce. The two of you did the best you could for your baby. 

A lot of times babies don't get sick because they don't go out a lot and are not around a lot of people. Sometimes adult viruses don't affect kids, and kid viruses don't affect adults. 

Breastfed or not, once they start preschool, they'll get sick. I breastfed both of my kids for a year each and I've wiped enough runny noses to last a lifetime and bought enough cough medication and Motrin that I should probably invest in those companies.
Probably a mixture of genetics and luck when it comes to the immune system (IMO).  I breastfed my baby (still do for naps, etc at 1.5 yrs) but I'm squarely in the camp of "fed is best" when it comes to babies. If that's via breast great or if it's formula also great.  What works for someone doesn't have to work for everyone. No shame either way.  

I'm glad your little one is doing so well! My baby made it to one year before getting her first cold.
Best baby is fed baby.
You did your best! Traditionally you‚Äôd have a village wet nurse to fall back on - we don‚Äôt have that, but we do have formula.
The thing is, fed is best. Breast milk is better but the differences are nowhere near as drastic as many people believe. The studies that don't show a big difference just get ignored, or aren't published. People should never feel guilty if they can't breastfeed. 
Not defending the companies pulling this shitty behaviour, but please don't let your wife beat herself up!
lactation cookies....? 

I feel like it sounds delicious and yet.. somehow maybe not for me.
Bro... wtf. You gonna just sit there and watch your wife struggle without picking up the slack? Why can't you breastfeed?
The skin on skin is definitely a part of that as both the mum and the baby produce more oxytocin. There's other hormones released that promote relaxation too.

Just the act of breastfeeding your child helps BOTH the mother and the baby. It also promotes healthier attachments for the child when it comes to people.

Another reason nƒìstle are absolute fucking cuntsacks is they paid people to pretend to be doctors, send them to poor places, and tell them that all of these things were bad.

They've caused death and harm to hundreds of thousands of children.
As an offhand comment like that it sounds presumptive/sexist but there are some studies that suggest that male bodied folks experience more symptoms than women from the same colds. Something to do with their immune cells reacting more strongly to viruses.

I‚Äôm not a doctor but here‚Äôs a Times article from 2017 on it: 
https://www.google.com/amp/time.com/4683864/men-sick-cold-flu/%3famp=true
Right? Had me up until that point but we took a quick turn into yikes territory
yeah that is bullsh /sneeze. oh fuck! /runs (hobbles slowly) to the ER
Yup it really is. Women are conditioned to suck it up and carry on (especially domestically because women are still expected to do most of the housework and childcare) and men generally don't have the same expectations.

There's exceptions obviously, but this dynamic is still really common and it sucks.
Casual housewife flex. Every mom on Reddit thinks staying home is hard. Imagine having time off from a job that is legitimately hard. It‚Äôs actual worth resting.
Do you have a source for this? The stuff I‚Äôve read says the opposite of this.
The mom makes antibodies after fighting off the cold, so the baby does not have to suffer. And neither does the mom. It is so worrisome when your child who does not how to blow their nose yet is stuffy and having double breathing.
oh ok thx
oh, ok. thx.
The science is neutral, the filling of a needed service is good, the company is bad. 

A company could do all the good things Monsanto does without doing many of the bad things.
Killing bees and establishing monocultures are *not* that great, even if there is a lot of output. Humans have been creating GMO's for millennia, such as with corn and blueberries and cows and just about anything we eat.

I'm all for reducing food scarcity, but their goal is to make money, so they take shortcuts and ignore things like not rotating crops, not using pesticides and herbicides that decimate things like amphibians and fireflies, and so on.
My family's farm uses many different types of seed depending on what the soil condition is in different parts of the field. They also constantly trial new products from multiple companies on different plots.

Seed licensing agreements are for the seed you bought that year, and say you can't replant it (which farmers wouldn't do anyway) but it doesn't force any sort of exclusivity for that year or subsequent years. I have no idea where you got that idea from.

Here's a farmer's explanation of what's actually in the seed agreements, with them stating that they are planting seed from competing companies in the same year. https://thefarmerslife.com/whats-in-a-monsanto-contract/
That NPR article is correct.
My family has a farm and I am a PhD plant geneticist. I've seen the constant arguments saying they do and none of them add up.
Hm, well I'd assume that is in large parts due to people preferring to drink sparkling and not using a diy sparkler

It‚Äôs not just this company. Companies, especially big corporations are not your friend. They‚Äôre not an entity that wants to help or provide for you. They exist to make money and most are run by psychopaths and sociopaths and don‚Äôt care how the money makes it to them
It was a generic comment, wasn't aimed at any "big company reddit hates" in particular.
It's the partner company of colgate that is decimating forests and palm trees to harvest the oils from largely endangered areas.
Adding some fat can make food more satiating. Adding some protein or fruit can reduce subsequent cravings. This is a version of the input-output model of dieting that's by now pretty thoroughly invalidated.
fair point, but those cauliflower crust frozen pizzas seem like at least a nutritional improvement, and they taste purty good
[removed]
you can if you don't increase the serving size, some of the less healthy ingredients will be replaced (in the serving) by the more healthy.
Better.  I'm not sure that's the right word.  In a first world country, there's not much reason to use that word with food.  Many folks use that to support their case that their particular diet type is superior to the particular diet type that others use.  Examples being vegan vs. carnivore or keto vs. normal, etc.  If one eats in moderation and variation keeping their calorie count in check, there's no clear winner in which diet type is best.  Fat out of shape vegans are a thing much like crossfitters who diet on beer and pizza.  If you are in reasonable shape through activity and reasonable weight through *.diet and activity, that is the goal....not shaming one diet vs. another.
I don't necessarily disagree, but when you say that the "corporations run Washington" isn't that laying the blame on Capitalism more than you initially let on?
The issue is that a business is a system.  Individuals are sorely disadvantaged in changing a system.  Like, if a CEO sacrifices monetary return for ethics, the board will just replace him, citing diminishing returns. This is why a system, like a political force, is far better at restricting terrible unethical business practices than self-regulation.   

In order for any business to mark itself as successful all it needs to accomplish is turn profit.  Everything else is secondary.
We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can have capitalism and regulations.
Nope I would never vote for Shillery or any neo-liberal. Only people I will vote for in 2020 is Bernie, Gabbard, maybe Yang, Warren

(In that order)

Last neo-liberal I voted for was Obama first term (second term I voted for Ron Paul)

Never will vote for a neo liberal ever again.

Also will never vote for a republican again (I voted for trump for the wrong reasons and I'm still smacking myself eish I voted for Jill Stein)
I'm talking about Capitalism, not political parties.  The Democratic Party and The Republican Party both love money more than the society they operate in.
Holy shit, you‚Äôre super right. I totally glazed right over the speculative language in the articles I pulled up before posting‚Äîthank you for the correction!
Lbr they‚Äôre almost certainly going to reformulate the fuck out of them. Those companies were probably STOKED to have the out.
Not at all. General Mills bought them last year.
Not sure if serious.  They caught a few years back for lying about what was in their ingredients.
Kroger said they are no longer accepting VISA Debit cards, I think.
I feel like the fed is best argument is arguing something totally different than a formula vs. breastfeeding debate. 

Yes, let‚Äôs not starve our children. Full stop. 

Doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a strong argument to be had in favor of breastfeeding or at least...a civil discussion about it. Choosing formula or breastfeeding does result in a non dead baby...but it‚Äôs ok if there‚Äôs more to it than that.

It reminds me of the argument over gender preference. It‚Äôs ok to want a boy or a girl. 

To say ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs healthy‚Äù always frustrated me because...that‚Äôs a completely separate discussion that‚Äôs like...DUH. I‚Äôd choose healthy first of course. Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want a daughter as I‚Äôve never had a sister, and am surrounded by Y chromosomes. Its ok that I have a preference and I don‚Äôt want to be shamed for it.
First off lactation cookies are amazing. My wife made oatmeal lactation cookies, so good, but also they really worked. She too had issues producing enough milk. She tried the cookies for the second child and the minute she started eating them she started producing mor. First child went to 6 months second child went to almost 9 months.
Haha, the lactation consultant recommended them. I actually tried one and dipped it in milk. Don't think it works for dudes though!
I was going to mention that it‚Äôs not just them ‚Äúacting‚Äù sicker, there have been studies that show evidence of men are ACTUALLY sicker; because our body attacks and fights it differently.
> As an offhand comment like that it sounds presumptive/sexist

That's because it is. Note how they said the word "act".
So we don't ACT more sick, we actually FEEL more sick because we ARE more sick.

Which makes the comment sexist as fuck.

*Let me return the favor.*

Mothers and fathers are the last people who should be trusted to know what's best for their children because they lack the capacity to be objective about it.
Yeah... you misunderstood that, and that's also sexist stereotypes. Most men I know are prone to hiding their symptoms and being tough. Furthermore most men I know share in house work. 

Women are certainly forced to go through more physical stress biologically than men, and there's no doubt there are certain societal responsibilities placed on many women. Both of those things often make women tough. 

That all said, for both sexes have tough and weak people.
Okay her comment may have been a little sexist, but don't fight sexism with sexism -- raising young children is a lot of work. Stay at home mothers work hard.
Damn. Fire with fire. This comment sucks more than her casually stereotypical man cold comment.
That men have stronger immune systems?

There's more out there if you need it.
They could, but Monsanto is proving the value of the technology.  That will eventually pave the way for a better company to do the same thing.
There are other things that can be done too, such as growing inside hydroponic greenhouses.  
  
However, what Monsanto does is still valuable as a transition.  They produce a good (but not perfect) product, that requires few infrastructure changes in order to transition to better food production.  
  
I wish their business practices were a bit better (though as another poster pointed out, they're not quite as bad as I thought), but I definitely think they do more good than harm.  Long term though, I would much rather see GMO's used to create longer lasting, better tasking, larger, and cheaper food products as pesticides can eventually be controlled in other ways for many foods.  
  
As of right now though?  Roundup+Roundup Ready crops are the best method we have that can be used en masse.
Nice degree, but it's not about their science. The science is great. It's the way they lock in struggling farmers with their seeds and make it nearly impossible to break away.
https://www.google.com/amp/amp.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/why-germans-are-obsessed-with-mineral-water

> Though German tap water is among the safest and best-tasting in Europe, most Germans prefer bottled water, in mineral, sparkling, and flat varieties, purchased by the case at the grocery store, or by the bottle at a restaurant, like wine. Water in German restaurants is offered with or without Gas, but even most non-sparkling water offered at restaurants and bars won‚Äôt be tap water, but uncarbonated mineral water.

In the US it‚Äôs really rare anyone orders bottled water in a restaurant.
Yes, it‚Äôs slogan was ‚ÄúPalmalov, you‚Äôre soaking in it.
It's nearly always better to replace though. Too many people add a miracle food or some bullshit to reduce weight but don't look at the bad parts of their diet and reduce those.  

In your example adding fat or vegies for satiation would mean you eat less in subsequent meals.  So you aren't truly adding but replacing or even reducing. Weight loss should be looked at a long term.  It's better to calorie count over a week or even a month then per day.  Some days you do worse.  Other days you do better.  It's the trend that matter not the data points.  

And yes calories in and out isn't as accurate as it could be or even that useful for many people.  But for the majority of people it's a good place to start and if it doesn't work it's time to look into other things.  Trouble shooting is just as often about what doesn't work then what does is and narrowing down answers till you figure out what works for you.
these things decrease calorie count?
But they take away the bread part and put in cauliflower.  That's not an addition.
jet fuel cant melt steal beams

"Its not real capitalism, real capitalism has never been tried!"
Lays the blame on the electorate. Corporate lobbyists are not a capitalist idea.
Feels like that's not the case. Capitalism is trying to take out the regulations constantly, trying to 'loosen its fetters' in the persuit of the almighty dollar.

>As of right now though?  Roundup+Roundup Ready crops are the best method we have that can be used en masse.

Not really, it just creates resistant weeds too. It's just like the issue with antibacterial soaps creating resistant bacteria.

>We do not have to go into detail about probabilities to assess whether superweeds will form ‚Äì we already have confirmation that they have. Twenty-four cases of glyphosate-resistant weeds have been reported  around the world, 14 of which are in the United States \[7\]. Farmers are  now back to tilling their farmlands and spraying more toxic herbicides in addition to Roundup in an attempt to control the superweeds spreading  across their farmlands \[8\].  
>  
>Additionally, because many of the superweeds can still be killed by glyphosate if it is sprayed in higher doses, many farmers are spraying more glyphosate and other herbicides to combat the weeds. The attraction  is that this is much less labor intensive than plowing and handpicking weeds out of the soil \[9\]. Consequently, [a report](https://www.organic-center.org/reportfiles/GE13YearsReport.pdf)  drawing from US Department of Agriculture data on pesticide use  estimated that an additional 383 million pounds of herbicides have been used than if Roundup Ready crops were never introduced \[6\]. This increased use of glyphosate heightens the likelihood of higher concentrations of the chemical running off into nearby ecosystems. At these elevated concentrations, glyphosate may be capable of causing environmental damage.  
>  
>Furthermore, the practices of tilling and increased herbicide use are  similar to what they were 20 years ago (with even more reported  herbicide use). This is both an environmental problem and a financial  problem for farmers who must now revert to spending more on herbicides and labor costs to till the land \[10\].  
>  
>While Roundup Ready crops themselves have not caused environmental  damage, they are certainly responsible for the Roundup-intensive weed  management practices that have accompanied them. **The environmental  benefits ‚Äì reduced tilling and reduced use of more toxic herbicides ‚Äì  are fading because the weeds Roundup was supposed to control have sprung up in revolt.**

They don't though... As I I also said my family has a farm...
Because you order soft drinks instead
You're literally arguing my case. My point is that adding a small amount of cheese to the diet (in the example I gave) reduces the *overall* calorie intake.

The evidence is that people doing restrictive diets, based on the calories in vs calories out model, gain weight in the long-term.

There are a small fraction of people who can optimise off the base of a low-calorie diet, but they tend to be highly interested in exercise and nutrition. 

This is old news to nutritionists but I have come to believe people in the fitness forums are never going to catch on.
1. I literally just said the input-output model has been debunked but okay sure you're relying on it so

2. Diet is your *overall* pattern of food intake, and if adding some cheese to your omelette means you feel full with less omelette, or if adding some fruit means you don't get sugar cravings and binge on chocolate then yes, it does decrease *overall* calorie count.
No but they indirectly decrease calorie count by making you less hungry so you eat less
If you make more than one serving at a time, then no, it's not changing the ingredients, it's adding ingredients to it. 

As with almost everything, doing it in bulk makes it a more efficient process.
All governments are mutts. There are no purebreds. Everything has a pinch of this and a dash of that.

It ended largely the same way then too, with the more beneficial "CEO" regulated out of his position, [so the monopolistic ratfucker could take over](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jan-Pieterszoon-Coen)

Moral of the story: Carnegies and Sinegals always lose, Morgans and Waltons always win. Being "too moral" to buy polichickens is a slow death spiral to defeat.
I was willing to partially agree with you up until here. I don't blame the electorate at all. Lobbyists exist to drive representatives away from what their constituents want. They are funded by corporations to create legislation such that they will profit. It is capitalism (in)directly shaping legislation.
That is where an informed electorate comes into play. That is why everyone needs equal voting power, so that the coal miners who want job security don't get to count as 3 or 4 votes per person, because of the promise of deregulating the coal industry.   


The problem is more complex than focusing on the flaws of Capitalism. Those flaws can be regulated by an informed active electorate. The U.S. doesn't have that kind of electorate. We have tribalist sport fans. Emotional voters and fools...whose votes often count for more votes than people in population centers.
I don't actually know who owns Victor. I don't really like the ingredients a ton, but I know nothing about their sourcing or production standards

As you pointed out, the benefits are fading, which means there are benefits, just not as many anymore.  Which is all the more reason to switch to better (but more expensive) systems.  That doesn't mean the company hasn't done good things.

fair.  Sorry for being terse.  At home with three puking kids.  Little grumpy.
I don‚Äôt keep up with the latest in food science, but I don‚Äôt see how that debunks the input/output model.

Treating myself to a little ice cream as a reward for going to the gym motivates me to keep it up, but it doesn‚Äôt make ice cream healthy even though including it in my diet makes me healthier overall.

In other words, if you have enough willpower to control your caloric intake and cravings then input/output model is still correct.
Can you explain how an input-output model of dieting has been debunked?
That all I agree with.
No worries! 

Thank you for responding.
The article says visa credit will no longer be accepted at some stores, but visa debit will. 

Still surprising all around. I bet it‚Äôs a threat so that visa will lower fees. Kroger is one of the largest retailers in the United States, so visa will take quite a hit.
So did they fucking use slaves or what?
Do they know they're an ad?
Rest in peace journalism.
Why is this a bad thing? If Momdelez knew about it and was correct. what's wrong with publicly calling out Nestle? Is this not competition?
I thought NaBisCo made Oreos...
Regardless of what Nestle is doing, this is despicable, and The Guardian has bought shame upon it's name
Oreos are love

Oreos are life
If it talks like a duck... 
>  "As with any publication, there's a strict separation between the advertising and the editorial content, so we do not have a say in the editorial content that is featured in that particular section," a Mondelez spokeswoman said in an email.

That hasn't been true in print media for quite some time.
I mean when your competitors are supporting slavery does it really matter who sponsored the story. In any other example I might call foul but I mean.......come on
There is a slave kid making shirts somewhere, jealous as hell that there is a slave kid on the other side of the world, making Oreos.
The ads are getting more powerful by the day!
I've never understood the circle jerk over the Guardian on here. 
Does that matter if it's true?

Not that Mondelez has much room for riding their high horse, but Nestle is a notoriously shitty company with numerous human rights violations under its belt. 
OK?  Nestle's admitted it.  It's not scandalous.
Poeple who use adblock plus can't see it's a sponsored post, that's very dangerous
Oreos are awful knockoff cookies.  I eat Hydrox cookies instead.
What kind of reputable news organization lets competitors sponsor news articles against companies?
The plot thickens to smooth buttery icing.  
all newspapers are propaganda whores ... pay enough and they write whatever you want
   And for the millions of us who use Ad Block - this didn't appear and we read the article anyway.   hmmm

    Political superpacs for everything?
Didn't oreos make rainbow cookies for gay rights or something?
Wow, does OP work for Nestle as PR or something? 

Fuck off, they used salves, they were wrong. The end.
The vast majority of chocolate is harvested by slaves. Nestle might be slightly worse than the competition, but Hershey, Lindt, Reeses, and Godiva are also benefiting from slave labor. 
yeah nestle does admit that. just the article was paid for by mondelez. there are other articles covering the story not by the guardian
Yes.  It's just that the people who told us was a rival oligarch.  No journalist would defy Nestle with a backer in the aristocracy, are you kidding?  They'd be out of a job in a heartbeat and blacklisted from the career if they went rogue and exposed crimes of the wealthy without permission.
Their suppliers in the third world did, I don't see how that's their fault.
Remember the Maine!
There was disclosure in the article, this really isn't news.
It's not a bad thing. Mondelez sponsored a series of articles on sustainability. Guardian journalists created content without the input of Mondelez and ran them in the series that Mondelez sponsored. This was in no way a hit job paid by Mondelez. People need to RTFA.

quack quack
They got bought by Evilcorp
[Mendolez](http://www.mondelezinternational.com/brand-family) owns Nabisco and many many others.

Kraft Foods owns Mendolez and many many others. Also should be mentioned that Kraft, Oscar Mayer and Heinz merged making a behemoth.
Oreo -> Nabisco -> Mendolez

product -> brand -> owner
WhOa DuDe
Which part is more shameful?  The fact that Mondelez sponsored the article, or the fact that Nabisco uses child slave labor to make their cookies?
[deleted]
When has the guardian ever had a sense of integrity? It's always been just a political trash rag
Secrecy isn't a part of the definition of a scandal.
which is backwards, adblock really should hide the entire article and just show that something was hidden because it was a sponsored post.
And double stuff Oreos for polyamorous rights.  
Cadbury too.
The article had to do with Nestle's involvement in the seafood trade. The slaves they were talking about are the Asian people that are tricked into taking a "job" on a fishing vessel, only to be told that they are actually slaves once they are international waters.
Reeses is a Hershey product, just FYI
because they determine who their suppliers are......
I'm assuming they knew that their suppliers were using slavery to get them their goods, which is awful.
too soon
yeah and even if it was a hit job, it doesn't matter as long as it's true
Thanks, that's what I figured. Even if it was, it seems like the comments are upset over this when I don't see why.
Kraft does not own Mondelez. They (with Warren Buffet and 3G) merged with Heinz.
Also should be mentioned all of these were once tobacco-owned (RJ Reynolds - Nabisco, Philip Morris - Kraft).
Just like how

Sheinhardt Wig Co. owns General Electric who owns NBC Universal

What kid wouldn't want to work in a cookie factory?! :-) /s
i feel like by pitting the two against each other in a "which is worse" question you will inevitably be perceived as only condemning one while excusing the other.
Calling what out? They didn't hide it 
Just like every other major newspaper. They are all happily editing out any content that doesn't agree with their individual platforms.
They disclosed that the article was sponsored. Ethically speaking, they're in the clear for this one. Still shit in general, though.
Eww gross, there is fish in my chocolate?!?
That's fucking disgusting. And what's worse is I'd have a hard time boycotting a company that does this because their brand ownership is so vast.
I'm gonna have to make those Girl Scout Tagalongs last me a whole year.
there's a middle man inbetween the farmers and the company. they don't know the same way we dont know. at least thats how it is in ivory coast.
Businesses in the third world do all kinds of shady things, should we just boycott products from there?  How is a company supposed to know when the supply chain goes so deep? Isn't it the government's job to do that?
Yeah but paying an extra 35 cents for your candy bar would be awful too.
Never too soon for the Rough Riders.
You don't see a moral quagmire with companies paying for journalists to write scandalous articles about their competitors? Even when the facts are accurate, that is a disturbing and unacceptable practice.

The Fuck!?
I... don't really care?  

This isn't the Bible, wherein all sins are equal before the eyes of God.  We're comparing child slavery and sponsoring a negative article about a competitor.  I'm not sure Mondelez necessarily has done anything I need to excuse or condemn.

Nestle on the other hand...
No, no, no, you don't understand. It's just that those stories aren't newsworthy. 
Pretty much my point.
not better than peanut butter?
It's the real first world problem. It's too easy to be evil and not care. (Please don't confuse this with a plea to pretend to do something about it)
I agree, reading stories about the people enslaved on these ships opened my eyes to just how terrible human beings can still be
Sadly, Girl Scout cookies are also part of the problem. https://www.change.org/p/girl-scouts-of-u-s-a-commit-to-use-ethical-cocoa-in-your-cookies
But the thing is we do know. Its common knowledge that slavery takes place on fishing vessels off the coast of Asia. Nestle even admitted that they knew it.

Companies have far more control over their supply chain than you are giving them credit for; especially a company this big
> Businesses in the third world do all kinds of shady things, should we just boycott products from there?

No, as there are many companies that have shown they aren't this shady (you know, because they pay their employees)

> How is a company supposed to know when the supply chain goes so deep?

Seriously? Its because its their supply chain. Nestle knew about this, they just thought it wasn't a big deal. They even admitted to knowing about it

> Isn't it the government's job to do that?

Yes and no. Its their job to control it, but the US government isn't going to get involved because its in international waters/doesn't involve Americans as slaves and the local governments aren't either because they don't give a shit/are being bribed
That's twice as bad as slavery.
It's far less disturbing than say, co-signing on and profiting from slave labor. It's not like the article is digging up dirt on the personal lives of Nestle execs. I'm glad that anyone, even a competitor, would expose in humane business practices. What's wrong with accountability? 
If they are aware of it and it's true, what's the issue? Why would this be any worse than political candidates calling out things that opponents have said or done in the past in order to hurt their campaign? If anything this is more acceptable than that, seeing as it's 1 private business making a deal with another private business in an attempt to gain market share. Enabling a report to come out on something like this that would not have come out otherwise is actually morally a good thing for the Oreo company to do on my opinion. This is slavery we're talking about, after all. In professional hockey, teams will tell the ref if an opposing player has an illegal curve on his stick, hoping to get the player penalized and remove the advantage. Nestle is using illegal, immoral tactics to gain market share and all Oreo is doing is letting the public know. 
They have a complicated history but are two separate companies..

"In August 2011 Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one snack-food and the other grocery.[44] The company changed its name to Mondelƒìz International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off.[45] Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. "

In simple terms.. Kraft grew into Mondelez then spun off another company called Kraft which is the Kraft we know today (now apart of Heinz)
To be fair, I had no clue it stood for that until I saw the comment with the N, B, and C capitalized, so figured those letters stood for something. 

We all learn something every day 
> Its common knowledge that slavery takes place on fishing vessels off the coast of Asia. 

So boycott all fish from southeast Asia?
No, it's the government of Thailand's job, it their country after all.
Is a two way door. The article mentioned more companies than Nestle, but it should have mentioned the financial interest by Mondelez and noted if Mondelez is involved in the same trades or similar and to what degree. 

I trashed Nestle in that thread and I think reasonably fairly, but it brought Nestle on people's radar and not Mondelez and this can influence purchasing behavior which can directly profit Mondelez.

One thing that we can hope is that perhaps this could blow up enough that these multinationals might start going tit-for-tat on exposing each other's supply chains. 

One thing I should perhaps say is that Nestle, while I think it acted late and perhaps cynically so with the Thai situation, it has at least managed a partial hangout, which is either ethical progress, or an indication that they are just getting better at politics. On the offchance that it is showing some ethical progress, I am pleased they have done so.
The problem is that the info could have been wrong. We talked about stuff like this in my communication ethics class.

Buffet holds a big chuck on Kraft and isnt in Mondelez, but both have big investments from vanguard, blackrock and wellington.
I have no idea; thank god I'm not in charge of trying to solve this problem
International waters aren't part of Thailand....
but it's not.
Vanguard, black rock and Wellington are major investors in almost everything... That doesn't say much about the relationship between the companies.

For example Vanguard owns almost 6% of General Mills.
If it's their citizens it's their job to stop it.
But what if it was? That's the point. You can't use the "but it worked out in the end" argument to justify a risky action, why does it fly for this?
Well, they don't appear to have holdings in Nestle. I guess the nestle ownership isnt exactly public, however, as shareholder identities are protected under swiss law.
http://investors.morningstar.com/ownership/shareholders-major.html?t=NSRGY 

The french woman, Liliane de Bettencourt, who owns  something like a third of L'Oreal apparently has a 25% + share, while Nestle owns 23% of L'Oreal.

And how do you propose they do that?
If it was, it wouldn't be a story and it would be a failed investment by Mondelez

You didn't address my argument.
My city in the news for something not drug related feels good man
I am originally from Baltimore and the water is so good there that there had been frequent discussions in the city council about  Baltimore City bottling and selling its own water.

Every time it gets to a fever pitch a drought occurs so the plans are dropped.

If someone was siphoning it all off Baltimore would be shit out of luck.
Congratulations Baltimore. I trust you have those frackers under control as well.
I‚Äôm amazed it is the only one...
This needs to be a nationwide thing
Flint Michigan wasn't a privatized utility. 

With a government run utility, elected officials have a hand in limiting rates. This causes equipment to become obsolete or dilapidated. This equipment is usually also specialized and lucratively expensive. This forces these utilities to defer upgrades and maintenance. 

There's also the skilled labor required to maintain the infrastructure. Often these positions require specialized training and/or licensing. If utilities can't keep up with the private sector, they risk losing their best people. 

I'm not saying one is better or worse than the other. A privatized utility usually produces a product for profit so they tend to raise rates as needed to stay profitable. Government run utilities tend to keep rates lower despite the need to raise rates to keep up with growth, repairs, and personnel because politicians tend to balk at rate increases.

Edit because mobile 
I'm from a 3rd world SEA country, employed in a private corporation that is in the water supply industry. Water districts here are typically government owned, but are open for privatization.

Before the procurement of one of our projects, one water district had budgets of up to 10,000 USD per year for expansion, rehab, and maintenance. No sensible water district can survive on an annual budget that small. Their water supply was not stable 24/7. 50% of the water they supply were lost in leaks, theft, and evaporation. 

Year one of our partnership, their budget went up to 4 million USD. That exact year, 70% of their pumps gave up, 25% of their pipes needed replacement. They spend 3 million USD on repairs, saved 1 million USD for the following year's budget. 

Now they supply water 24/7,they've expanded their service coverage by 200%, reduced their non-revenue water from 50% to 20%. They've saved up for a new office building, several CSR programs, several new service vehicles.

I don't see where the hate for privatization is coming from. Maybe the case here and in other countries is different.

TL;DR, not all private water supply companies are evil. Some can improve the quality of thousands of lives. 

Edit: their water tariff increased by 0.10 USD, 10 cents, a dime, per cubic meter of 24/7 potable water. Each household typically consumes 8-10 cubic meters per month in said area. 
It's worth noting that Baltimore's water and sewer was and is a public works.  This just will save on legal issues in the future.  Either way, I cannot speak much on the pros and cons of water suppliers.  

My city's water is supplied by a private company, and is one of the cleanest sources of tap water in the US.
They‚Äôre against privatization, but also aren‚Äôt addressing their corroding infrastructure.  Interesting move Baltimore.
We need a season of The Wire to make us understand how this happened. 

I bet Senator Clay Davis had something to do with this. Shiiiiiiiiieet
Confused. So, if Baltimore continues to ignore infrastructure, the system crumbles, becomes Flint, now there‚Äôs no plan B?
I said "NICE!" outloud because I liked the words without considering the situation. Then I remembered that Flint, MI is not privatized. 
For the people who either didn't read the article or are too stupid to understand....  


Basically, Baltimore neglected their water infrastructure for decades, prices have quadrupled since 2000 because of that, and the government said they don't wan't the private companies offering to fix their shit because they don't want them to fuck it up.... when they themselves are the ones who let it go to shit.  


*We don't want customers to be at the whim of a business for water.* 

*Meanwhile prices have quadrupled under our supervision.*
Neither nationalised or privatised is inherently A better model. Managed correctly either can produce positive outcomes but managed poorly ether can have significant downsides.

The problem is that the choices / arguments tend to be made from an ideological standpoint first instead of an economic one and suffer heavily from a 'grass is greaner' effect whereby the current problems are perceived to be easily fixed by a switch of model which of course is rarely a remedy in itself.

In the UK we have this exact argument with our rail system at the moment. When it was a nationalised it was badly run and under funded. Now it is semi-private and isn't working terribly well so there are calls to re-nationalise it but with no plan about how that would actually make anything any better.

For what it's worth, the UK water supply is private  and seems to work from my own experience. It is heavily regulated though. 
This time next year Baltimore will be in the news again for the highest water prices in the nation 
Unpopular opinion: Baltimore‚Äôs public works are some of the worst in the country, and deprivatizing water will make it worse, if not dangerous. Have you driven in Baltimore?

(I lived there for four years)
All this means is that we'll be paying increased city taxes to subsidize the water infrastructure with subpar contractors. Infrastructure that, here in bmore, is utter garbage anyways.

Privatization of the water system would've been a good fucking idea. Too bad.
Everybody in this thread thinks a water ban on privatization is a good thing, let me tell you why it‚Äôs not.

I work for a private water utility. We service a large area in a county where there is no municipal water service. Our company was created by farmers who were tired of having to drill wells and relying on shitty, hard ground water in their homes.

Our company is a Co-op, so non profit organization basically which needs to pay its bills and employees. Our water rates are significantly higher than the municipality. In the article it states some private water companies are charging 4x the municipal rates. I can see this because we charge more as well, the reason is simple: When you don‚Äôt have hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in infrastructure, making potable drinking water costs more. Municipal utilities treat up to millions of gallons of litres per day, private companies can be much smaller.

Costs are always higher for smaller companies to deliver the same resource as a larger company, think Walmart vs. a family run retailer.

The problem with banning privatization is that it really affects rural users which don‚Äôt have a municipal utility in the area. A good practise would be to put a cap on profits instead of banning them al together. 

People may be thinking ‚ÄúMunicipal utilities can just expand to these rural users!‚Äù 

Not really. These rural users are literally all over the map. Municipalities need to build infrastructure, water and wastewater treatment facilities and then extend them literally to the furthest reaches of their service areas. Guess what, that won‚Äôt happen. And in the closer rural places it may, the price will be higher because it‚Äôll cost more to make water.

The water rates have been rising just like everything else, it takes chemicals, pumps using massive amounts of electricity, staff and facility upkeep to make water. Again, a cap on profits of private companies would be a better route.
Asking purely out of ignorance. Why is this considered a good thing?
Well that's working out great for flint, why not here?
Everyone cheering this doesn't know Baltimore. The infrastructure is absolutely crumbling. Water rates have increased 400% in the last decade or so because they neglected to account for maintenance.

Not to mention how corrupt and incompetant the city government is. There is absolutely no way they have a handle on this.

One of the deadliest cities on the planet and this is their focus. 
> Baltimore has one of the oldest water systems in the country, and decades of deferred maintenance have resulted in a quadrupling of water rates since 2000, Eckel said.

Well... Congrats?
Didn't privatized water get donated to Flint? 
Legit stupid question here; like, I'm sure this is a ridiculous question.

But what protects the city from the local government imposing ridiculous costs or deteriorating quality? The voting system?

God I really feel stupid asking this, but I'm genuinely curious. 
When is the 'freedom' lawsuit coming in?
[removed]
Hell yeah! We're in the news for something good! I love this city for real though.
Stupid legislation from a shithole city. Don't go there unless you have to. 
So how well does such a law hold up? Until the wrong person is elected removing the law again? There's a lot of money and power wanting to privatize it
Fuck ~~you~~ yeah Baltimore!
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.
Ironically they didnt need to ban it because the city council and mayor would have to sign off on privatization anyways.  

This would be like the mayor passing a law that says that the mayor doesnt have to eat his broccoli before dessert.  
Cool let‚Äôs all watch as this crumbles, the way the rest of Baltimore‚Äôs infrastructure has gone to crap.  I lived there for 20 years and moved out.  It hasn‚Äôt gotten any better in the time since I left.  
What is water privatization? Charging people a water bill?
Why in the hell do people think that some government agency is going to somehow magically solve all their  problems? Government typically is far less effective in Everything it does in comparison to the private sector. I have my own well, my water is awesome.
How many places have actually put this on the ballot?

Is Baltimore the first large city to even give their citizens the option?
ITT: People who think a government monopoly will run much smoother and effective over a corporate one.

It's all in the article.

>  Baltimore has one of the oldest water systems in the country, and **decades of deferred maintenance have resulted in a quadrupling of water rates since 2000, Eckel said.**

The city was responsible for the maintenance.  If it's been "deferred", that's because of the *city government*.  

> It has also prompted worries that privatization would cause further spikes, and that the city would have no control over who these most affected.

In other words, the entity that caused the infrastructure to collapse (the government) has voted against an outside corporation to come in and fix it.  Meaning the one that caused the problem is the one that is going to fix it.  Good luck with that.
All I want is to be able to drive home without Squeegee boys harassing me at every light. 
This is a total disaster. And no Reddit, outlawing privatization of water is a terrible idea. Proper regulation and tax incentives on the private companies is how you get better service.
What is so good about this that it made it to the front page? 
Yay they can poison the water for them. If they screw it up that's all you got folks. It'll be fixed just as soon as they fix the potholes in the road, or finish that construction that's been going on for years. Don't worry you'll be able to write your representative who you'll never hear from, but you can vote him out in like two to four years, maybe. Hope you can deal with weird water by then. 

There's no monopoly like a government monopoly. 
Supreme Court to overturn law and issue mandatory tracking collars in 3, 2, 1‚Ä¶ 
This is nothing but large government overreach.  

The City of Baltimore can't keep it's own citizens safe from crime.  With that track record the water quality should soon go down hill.
Privatization!? In my city?! In my town?! Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeet
Liberals just love Uncle Sam holding their hand and controlling everything. All hail big government. 
Water privatisation....wow. 
Water is a huge business. Most people dont realize how much money is in it. And building water plants to make up for this decision is expensive. 
I don't even know what "water privatization" means
Mineral water bottles started becoming a thing when I was in my late teens. That was more than twenty years back.
It was a ridiculous idea then as it is now.
Hopefully the boys down at the docks stay happy
NYC water is public and some of the best water in the country! You can drink it straight from the tap. I still use a brita filter but honestly you dont need it.
This from the state that taxes the very rainwater you collect on your own propety. I doubt this is some green dream fueld initiative. 
It's a pretty shitty country if this has to be a thing. 
Large water conglomerates like American Water are the new mob. They try to buy up any water system they can get their hands on, from large cities like Baltimore, to small municipalities across the nation. There are several case studies where they have purchased a water utility only to raise rates without investing much into the infrastructure. I believe it was Chattanooga, TN that sold to American Water, only to buy their water system back at a higher price just to be free of them.
Water is not a for profit product. It's a basic necessity that all humans need to survive. Never privatize water!
Water privatization is a symptom not a cause. These private water companies are becoming more common because local and city officials have been no qualified for their positions for decades. They have not upgraded when they should have , not made new ordinances that require houses to be upgraded and generally mismanaged funds. Baltimore is the prime example of mismanagement from the tip down for a long time. Now im aginist private water but what is Baltimore going to do with the 10s of millions of upgrades they need and the people who shouldn't be drinking the water now? Next year they will declare an emergency and try and get fed funds. The real problem is we shouldn't allow unqualified people in these positions.
Note that government management of water isn't necessarily "better".  Flint, MI is a prime example.  It's more about honesty, competency, and a lack of corruption.
Now if the government pays a private company to do the water for you, then make this after they try to profit. Well that's pretty scummy too and stupid on the government's part from the start to give them the control. 


When is the 'freedom' lawsuit coming in?
>Baltimore has one of the oldest water systems in the country, and decades of deferred maintenance have resulted in a quadrupling of water rates since 2000, Eckel said.

Yea? That public utility is doing a bang up job. Better hurry up and protect it by law. SMDH
If this catches on how will the fossil fuel extraction companies transition to water their next cash cow. First pollutes most of the water sources. And then charge an arm and leg for the little clean water that is left over. 
How this is an issue baffles me. 
Baltimore's my hometown.  Kind of a little inside joke many of my friends and I had was whenever the subject of crime, corruption, The Wire, the crumbling infrastructure, etc, would come up someone would chime in, "but we have really good tap water!"
The fact that Baltimore is doing something should be considered a solid argument that it is probably a bad idea.  If Baltimore held a chocolate and puppies festival, I'd have to reevaluate my life.
In a sociology class, we debated privatization of public sector establishments and in the end, privatization was the means to the end of civilization. Once you put a profit-motive on life needs of population, the disparity escalates in classes. 

We see it now with transportation (tolls still in place and % of revenue is lopsided toward the contractor, not the state),  maintenance, public works, etc.  Many argued that pensions are the reason for over-budget costs, but in truth, its mismanagement and politicians that abuse the funds. Pensions went away because the markets wanted that cash, so you had the push toward 401K (privatization of funds management away from state regulated funds/bonds). 

Looking at cases of water mismanagement, look at Flint MI. Or other states. "insert your state name" American Water is the perfect example of a corporate scam to rape the public of their necessity, water. They come in, entice the local politicians to move to privatization. The numbers, at first, look good, but after a few years, now the bills increase to the taxpayers. Now they want to increase the costs more to "cover the cost to repair the old lines"... Didn't anyone do their homework? Those pipes they bought were already 50+ years old! Did they think they would fix themselves?

No one likes regulation except when it protects us and the environment. Businesses are becoming immoral and greedy. We, as a species, are doomed.  (man, I just depressed myself... excuse me from the room please...)
That‚Äôs awesome. I watched the movie Blue Gold a number of years ago and it opened my eyes to the problem of water privatization. Corporations aren‚Äôt going to spend a penny more than they have to in order to meet the bare minimum requirements. 
In my opinion, the government banning the privatization of any good or service is a loss. 
Yeah, the same people who run Baltimore's school system (high-school graduation rate = 42%) now are also going to be in charge of providing the city with water?

Ahahaha, I sure as hell am glad that I don't live in Baltimore! I will look forward with anticipation to when this decision backfires massively, and we can add it to the (long and growing) list of progressive failures in that city.
Congrats Baltimore! My city/state had a vote about that  few years back, glad it was voted in favor of.

Also, on the topic of water privatization a much needed: Fuck Nestl√©.

Cool. Now can we do this with the internet please?
Sorry, help me understand. Does this mean I can't collect a glass of water and claim it as my property or that I can't claim to own the rain? Cause that's a pretty big difference. 
If humans found a way to exploit how much air we breathe, we‚Äôd be trying to privatize that too. It just makes no sense how shitty people can be 
I voted for this. Never had an issues with water or my rates and I'm hoping it stays that way.
This was inevitable. The ext major war will be a result of fresh water accessibility to world powers (unless oil comes first)
Good to see they are fixing the important stuff.  Homicides and Heroin be damned!
New York City tap water is still the best. No other place can compare 
Here, where I live, everything that is manage by the government becomes very inefficient and sucks a lot. Hope that‚Äôs not what happens there
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiet, that‚Äôs fantastic news. Way to go, Baltimore. 
[Congratulations man] (https://youtube.com/watch?v=SC4xMk98Pdc)
Something not drug OR murder related. It's a good day.
We're all happy for you guys 
I don't know man.

Half the people in this thread are either saying the water in Baltimore is absolutely amazing, delicious, and cheap. In which case there would be no reason to privatize the water anyways.  The other half say Baltimore's water supply is a crumbling train wreck that the city doesn't have the funds to pay to fix and that outside investment is the only way to overhaul the system and fix the myriad of problems.

Like all the rest of the "good news" coming out of Baltimore, this just seems like something the city council did to distract from the real problems going on, and to pat themselves on the back for not being super corrupt all the damn time. I can't help feel like this ban was somehow lining someone's pockets.


What are you talking about? This is clearly a move by big pharma to increase maintence drug sales by facilitating people's addiction to dihydrogen monoxide. 
Everyone else on some other ish. 
 Agreed. Good to see some good news in this area.

You should all celebrate with copious amounts of drugs
I can get a round trip flight to Baltimore for $75. How much tap water can I put in a checked bag? My town‚Äôs water sucks
Is it? I‚Äôm from just outside of Baltimore, and we don‚Äôt drink unfiltered tap water. It tastes bad out of the tap.
You do know this a huge FU middle finger to Nestle right? I'll be celebrating at Brewer's Art. 
Dasani is bottled tap water from my home town, Hollywood, FL.   Tbh i just refill all my water bottles from the tap anyway
We actually have a ban on fracking here in Maryland!
I have Baltimore city water and I would gladly pay more to a private company (or the city, who cares at this point) if they would just FIX THE F ING PIPES!
Next if we could just go two days without murdering each other we‚Äôd be on the right track 
It's the first US city to do so, and I am sure that there are other places in the world that does so in certain extent.
I‚Äôm amazed it was Baltimore. 
It's astonishing how our water and sewer systems are being run by corporations who don't care about the best interest of the public.
Though not banned in the town I live in, they tried to privatize our water because the city said they didn't have the money to pay for the crumbling infrastructure.  People threw a fit and the deal was shot down.  Just raise the water rates, how did they think a private company would pay for it? 
Slovenia has right to water written in Constitution.

It says that every person has right to clean water, water is public good and state manages it for its is prime intent to be  available to populace and homes and that water cannot be treated in any commercial  way.

State has obligation that thru local communities provide provide water to people directly and without profit,

It was incorporated by 64 of 64 members of Parliament by 100% yes in 2016.

I think the reason why Baltimore decided to ban privitization of water is because it has one of America‚Äôs oldest water sewage systems. According to the Reuters Article, "Baltimore has one of the oldest water systems in the country, and decades of deferred maintenance have resulted in a quadrupling of water rates since 2000." The city is also worried that if water in Baltimore is privatized, the water rate would spike by an estimate of 60% and the city has no control on who will be affected.

Speaking of your comment "this needs to be a nationwide thing", Pittsburgh's city government is having a serious discussion about that as well, however most members of the council appear to be resistant to the idea of banning water privatization for various reasons.






The discussion on if privatization of water utilities is a bad thing or not really needs some context.

**Why are most water utilities privatized?**
A water utility is taken over in most cases when the municipality has miss-managed things to the point where the EPA and state regulators are requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure upgrades when the municipality may be able to cover 10% of that. It‚Äôs why you see small towns with stupid cheap water bills. They just aren‚Äôt investing in infrastructure (plants, pipes, pumps, chemical treatment, etc).  A large water company with billions of dollars of available capital is in a much better position to implement the changes mandated by the regulators. 

**Why do rates immediately double or more when privatization happens? **
Capital Investment. If I‚Äôm buying a public utility, I‚Äôm going to evaluate the current condition of their assets, their maintenance schedules, the age of their pipes, flushing schedules, water quality reports, etc.  I‚Äôm then going to decide how much it‚Äôs going to take to fix everything, then take 10% of that number and do what I can with a 10-25 year upgrade path with 10-15 rate cases built in.  Why 10%?  Because no one wants their water bill to jump by hundreds, and no state regulator is going to allow that. The best I can hope for is 10% with planned increases over time to stay ahead of inflation. 



Maybe I‚Äôm biased. I do work for a large publicly traded water utility. I think we do a damn good job of maintaining the balance between investment and cost to customers though.  There‚Äôs a ton more information I could provide, but my phone isn‚Äôt the place to try to present a decent argument. 
Did you even bother to read the fucking article. Do you not understand why Flint is like it is? Because of fucking government managed water systems. Cities across this country are sitting tens of billions of dollars of deferred maintenance, lead in their water, and more, all because government management is not accountable. 
  
you cannot sue them because of Sovereign Immunity. they can tell you to fuck right off and have been. Yet you idiots are celebrating this? Seriously? At least with a private group you can hold their ass accountable. They actually have to do something to keep their contract.  
This needs to be a global thing
Maybe they'll start the trend. 
If it was privatized it would be more successful rofl
Or at least at the state level. It's not super effective to do this one city and town at a time.
Exactly this. Whoever owns the water needs to charge enough to fix the pipes. You can't simultaneously complain about high water prices and also crumbling pipes.
Flint was previously got its water from the City of Detroit. The problem was that Detroit charged them an arm and a leg for it, and did in fact jack up rates. It was seen as a big point of corruption at the time. In getting off Detroit's water, the Flint emergency financial manager probably figured that they could save a ton of money by getting the water locally. Unfortunately they were negligent and the Flint River water eroded the lead pipes into the drinking water, leading to the shitshow that happened. 
This is leaving out tons of context for Flint's problems. One, they built most of their system just a few years before manufacturing work started collapsing during a boom and the city never got anywhere near the system's design capacity which means less people paying for a much large system than needed. Secondly, control over the Flint water was ousted from city officials by the state under dubious "emergency manager" unrelated to the water system. However that Emergency Manager overruled the local counsil's plan for water system improvements and implemented a quick switch to the Flint River, which then despite numerous complaints, had the water testing reports falsified and skimped on water treatment chemicals leading to the entire disaster. Even after a legionnaires breakout, the tests were still being falsified but they added some chlorine, but none of the other shit like pH balancing and anti-corrosion until over a year after it hit national news. So for multiple years they were basically pumping polluted river water from an urban area surrounded by old manufacturing plants into peoples homes without treatment.
Answer: stop cutting taxes that would otherwise be used for public infrastructure, and for the general common good. And actually make sure the money goes there and ya know not to some fatcat defense contractor or grafter. 
Stop making logical arguments. You should be sticking with the reddit narrative that privatisation is evil and exploitative, and government is angelic and pure. 
finally sanity. NRW, maintenance and the historical track record of public run enterprises. I'd love to see a profitable well run government ownee water utility though, I'm sure it exists somewhere but the conditions for that won't always be present in cities and towns around the world. 
Just like any industry, there are good and bad of both. 
The faucet and the goose that lay'em golden eggs!

My first thought was how is Clay Davis making money on this. 
but capitalism is the devil, Mama
Thank you for your input. I really appreciate the response.  
As a water operator, thank you. I‚Äôm willing to bet most of the people up in arms about this have no clue what the water treatment process is.
The key thing here is that Baltimore City is the one banning privatization and there is no rural parts to Baltimore city. So while private water utilities might be better for rural areas, they would not be in a city, where there are enough people to cover the infrastructure costs. 
Thanks for bringing some common sense into this discussion. 
Mostly because people seem to hate the idea of having a private company running the water system. It's not really well-founded, considering there have been numerous examples of both types of systems performing poorly. The most well-known example, Flint, was apparently public-run, so it's not all it's cracked up to be. 


Speaking truth in a deluded world. 
My water bill last month in city of Baltimore was $39.58 for a two bed, 1 bath row house with two occupants
In practice, nothing prevents the city from doing whatever they want to the price. Often what happens is that politicians will actually keep the rate *too low* out of fear of voter backlash, which results in insufficient funding and decaying infrastructure. 

I think the ideal system is a public/private partnership with lots of public oversight. That way the company still has to work to make a profit and maintain the system, but they're prevented from abusing the system. 
They already have. The city‚Äôs water infrastructure is crumbling, many of the water mains are still made out of wood, and anytime we get a hard rain TONS of sewage dump into the harbor to prevent backups into people‚Äôs homes. 
It got better when you left. 
It's who manages the water... public utilities still charge of course, but their entire operation is subject to public input, rate increases go through public approvals, etc. 
Water being controlled and managed by private corporations (large ones of course), I believe 
Over here in Ireland a few years back our water control was handed over to ''Irish water'' and we basically ended up having to pay water charges twice, one for Irish water and one through other tax routes. The entire country was outraged and most stopped paying their bills, thus the government and Irish water can't charge everyone. It's a joke in many western countries.
Because half of Reddit consists of angsty anti-capitalist teenagers. Go to /r/politics or /r/LateStageCapitalism if you want to roll your eyes so hard you‚Äôll see your own brain.
Yeah, wouldn't it be great if we privatized police departments? I'm sure there wouldn't be any perverse incentive structures. It'll be great. 
I m upvoting this (I am incredibly skeptical of full privitization ban as well) 
Please, if you honestly think that private utility companies are better than government-run utilities speak to the people of Chattanooga Tennessee about their municipal Fiber Optic internet.
When you going to pay 25% of your hard worked money to pay your water bill.. you will realize what it‚Äôs good for..
Seriously... just search the net for the outcomes of water privatization.. it will enlightens you 
The alternative is a big corp that is motivated only by money 
That‚Äôs actually the opposite of how it works here in California. Private utilities are incentivized to spend money to upgrade old infrastructure because they can charge their customers enough to receive like a 8% return on their investment. The government owned utilities are the ones incentivized to spend as little as possible.
Neither is the government
[deleted]
You know, calling any good or service a "basic human need" and making it a government-run monopoly isn't going to make it magically immune to the economics laws of supply and demand and scarcity.
Government still has a shitload of oversight over the quality and allowable prices of privatized water utilities. Also, many government run water systems contract out the operations and maintenance of the facilities to a private group. The lines between privatized and public water supply/treatment are much closer than you may belive and what works for one community might not work well for another.
There shouldn't be competition. Water is water. There's no way to innovate a basic molecule further. It should be provided at no cost to anyone who needs it (which is, everybody)
Competition in the tap water industry doesn't exist. Like many utilities, it would be too costly to provide people with multiple options. Every provider would have to build and maintain a set of pipes to every single house and business. These costs would be passed on to consumers, making the water even more expensive.
Hopefully it spreads everywhere. We need only look to private isps to see what the business sector thinks of the public and the importance of our satisfaction.
Water is a vital resource and should be regulated by the government so that a minimum standard should be achieved, that it is affordable and accessible for everyone. Competition is unnecessary as the government can do this perfectly (this is also the case in the Netherlands, where I am from).
You want a government-run internet?
Baltimore City went and bought land and built reservoirs out in the rest of the state years ago, so they are sitting on some valuable infrastructure.  I live out near one, and the city owns and maintains the road and bridge across the damn rather than the county.  The law bans selling the reservoirs.  It also bans selling the sewage services so a private company can run it and possibly raise prices.  Baltimore is the most populous independent city in the country, meaning it is essentially its own county.  It has huge tax revenue problems because they can't draw property taxes from the wealthier suburban areas where commuters live, while having to support a large poor population and city infrastructure.  The city has huge debt even after being subsidized by the state.   Selling off utilities was a possible source of income.
It means that companies can't monopolize public water resources in order to sell bottled water or price gouge for utility services. Nothing to do with individuals.
Neither of these. It means that the city of Baltimore can't sell its water distribution infrastructure (pipes, pumps, storage, treatment plants, etc) to private companies.

Should have no effect on anyone's ability to collect/sell water that they currently have the right to. Note that water rights are complicated and vary widely by location, so I'm not going to be able to tell you if you can collect or sell water currently.
Sorry to say it's the same here. Anything the gov manages is effed up.

Its all based on pipe work. Anything coming from Loch Raven and through good pipes is going to be better than just about anything you can buy. People with old pipes, well... It's the pipes not the supply, because even our non Loch sources are amazing
Yeah let's not forget that they're on I think the third police chief in 2 years, crime isn't going down, they misused the school budget so bad (probably embezzled) that they had to shut them down and then hand them over to the state and I think it's worth mentioning the detective that shot his partner in the middle of an empty parking lot just to exemplify the environment and culture of the city's  civil services 
Corporations will fuck consumers at every stage of water supply chain. The city needs competent board to run the show and outside auditors to verify - water is a community issue best run / owned by the people
When private invests the pipes though, the public ends up paying for it either way plus a cheeky profit margin.

Baltimore needs to raise their water bills and fix things themselves.
Baltimore water tastes very good. Now that I live in california, I'm trying to artificially make the water taste as good.
The water is bad, the system is crumbling, if anyone says otherwise they are outside the city.
So does mine. I live in Las Vegas and when I moved here eleven years ago there was a front page article about a dry cleaning chain that illegally dumped all its chemicals into the ground water for twenty years before being caught and going bankrupt to get out of paying for the clean up.
"Have you packed any aerosols, gels, or liquids in your luggage today, sir?"
Where can you get such a cheap flight?
Might be your pipes or water hose lines!
I‚Äôm in Baltimore County. Taste fine to me. $30 water bill every 3 months is great too.
I‚Äôm 20 minutes outside of Baltimore. The water is about as good as you can expect from tap. I‚Äôve lived in about a dozen different locations all around the country. The Baltimore area has its problems, water utilities isn‚Äôt one of them.
Yes if you're on Baltimore City tap including the suburban county it's some of the best water in the country.  If you're on a well or something in the rural areas, who knows.

You could also have immediately local water issues if you're in an old building
The wooders fuckin great for drinkin and shaaerin.

Source: three maybe four potentially five (Montebello?) beautiful well-maintained reservoirs.
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre probably on well water. 
Yeah Bmorian here, lived downtown by the harbor, water was very.. average, we filtered it too.
Meh, I've heard people say the exact same thing in cities that have won awards for their tap water... If you believe hard enough you'll convince yourself all tap water tastes bad
Well, things may have changed. I moved out west eleven years ago.

Our planet is pretty much going to Hell at this point.
Hopefully more states will follow suit. The low natural gas prices are not worth the environmental fallout. 
Lol not that it matters, there is no Shale formation there to be Fracked.  



Did you know industrial agriculture is a much bigger polluter than the entire energy and transportation sector combined? (Globally)
What are you talking about, we have some of the best water in the country.

https://publicworks.baltimorecity.gov/news/press-releases/2017-11-13-baltimore-city-water-ranks-among-top-10-nationally

Edit: yes the pipes are old in places and yes they break sometimes. My point is you don‚Äôt want Nestle owning our high quality water infrastructure, it will be a fucking disaster.
Are you sure it's the Cities pipes and not your house/buildings pipe? 
I live in Baltimore. The water quality is great. I also voted against privatization
Fellow Baltimoron but live in a nice part- what's with the pipes?
As long as Hogan is governor the city is going to keep getting shit on. 
Germany here. No privatized water here.


Berlin did partially privatize (49,9%) it's water supply system in 1999. As expected by everyone, price for water went up. And the higher-ups in politics didn't want to disclose the contracts they made with the private companies. Big surprise. So the people initiated a referendum that forced the city to disclose the contracts. After that, people started a second referendum to de-privatize the water again. The City had to buy back the privatized parts in 2014.


15 years it took. Fifteen damn years and the politicians who started it most likely got really rich. Fuck this. Water supply should not be up for privatization.
Like the entirety of the rest of the free world? Yes. The privitization of life giving water would cause riots anywhere else.
Home of challenge pissing.
If only there was some way a local organization of elected representatives could "oversee" the job the private company is doing.
Decades of deferred maintenance and quadrupling water costs since 2000 doesn't sound like it's in the public interest either.   
The vast majority of cities run their water systems as public-private partnerships. Which means that the utility is governed by intense regulation and oversight.

There are many advantages to this relationship, chief among them is that it avoids the politicization of a clearly vital service. Typically residents elect board members who oversee the corporate stewardship of the utility. It‚Äôs been a very effective model. Baltimore going fully public is a really risky choice. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how it plays out.
It's astonishing how many things are run by the government who don't care about the best interest of the public.

(Not making a point about this case, just trying to point out how making something government run doesn't magically make it better.
I pay about $100 bucks a month on water in a state that rains 6 months out of the year. It‚Äôs a big problem here that the water is so expensive. We were just put on meters only a year ago so before that, people were paying a set rate which is ridiculous because it didn‚Äôt matter how much you used. Most of my bill now is just fees from the water company, I think I only use $20 worth of water a month. 
>  Pittsburgh's city government is having a serious discussion about that as well, however most members of the council appear to be resistant to the idea of banning water privatization.

It's important to note that privatization has two very different meanings in this context.

First is where the municipality transfers ownership and/or operational control over the public infrastructure to a private organization.  This is what Baltimore has banned with their water system.

The second is where a private company installs their own infrastructure to provide the same thing that the public utility already provides.  In this scenario the public utility and the private provider both continue to exist and do their own thing, and consumers get to choose which they'd rather use.

This is what's being proposed in Pittsburgh.
[deleted]
I think there should be more government regulations on all services that most citizens have no choice in. Internet, water, garbage. All utilities. A lot of gouging going on. This country has become what the forefathers fought against. Can‚Äôt stand all the taxes and mismanagement of funds. 

Seattle we have more and more taxes and more tolls for bridges and highways which we already pay for. The city takes all this extra money from weed and tolls and sugar tax on soft drinks and can‚Äôt explain where the money is going. Shenanigans!!!!! 

Also the government won‚Äôt let us collect rainwater from our property, because they claim they own the rain. So they can charge us higher water bills. But the government isn‚Äôt paying for wear and tear caused by the rain. Help pay for my roof maintenance and paint and chalking 
I hope they have the funding to keep the system healthy. 
>for various reasons.

That's a weird way of saying money.
"decades of deferred maintenance have resulted in a quadrupling of water rates since 2000"

That doesn't make sense. Deferred maintenance saves costs rather than raising costs. Now if the article meant to say that new maintenance to catch up is causing the rate spike then it might make sense. 
I‚Äôm probably jaded, but Baltimore has 300 murders a year. Politicians need to wave a magic wand to distract citizens so that people won‚Äôt look at the urgent problems. 
That‚Äôs an interesting reason since most privatizations are INTENDED to attract investment in old systems that the city can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt pay for. It‚Äôs a means of shifting blame for subsequent rate increases on Big Bad Business. 

Note that the alternative (Flint on a bad day but usually just leaks and contamination) may be worse than higher water bills. 

Source: I‚Äôm a water economist ;)
That's what I usually figure.  The govt cant raise rates or taxes to cover the increasing costs, so things get outdated.  Years later, major work has to be done but political backlash would be huge if bills suddenly shot up as needed.
[deleted]
Yea you can, if the prices are high and the pipes are breaking simultaneously then you should be complaining.
That's a generous assumption regarding the EMs intentions. I'm not convinced it wasn't an effort to deprive Detroit of the revenue and push to privatize the Detroit Water Service. Detroit was going through a bankruptcy, and there were ongoung disputes over selling off city owned museum collections at the time. It was a weird, awful event, and I remember being pissed that the whole city could possibly be a casualty of a legal looting. 
Its easy to look back and say they over built the infrastructure, but if industry had continued to grow and they hadn't upgraded, people who needed and wanted water would have been without. 

You are right that there's a lot more to Flint, my point was the the government can screw it up as bad or worse than the privatized industry. If you want and example of the private sector screwing it up, check out Enron.
Local and federal taxes are two different animals.
Ah yes, because most towns in America are deep in the defense industries pocket aren‚Äôt they? How about the government stops mismanaging public utilities and using them as political tools before they prove they‚Äôre worthy of our money. 
I had to do a double take. You want more taxes? 
Well cutting taxes makes it fail so we have to privatize which could be a long term goal for some lobbyists. 
You realise that the government is not limited by taxes, right? Government has bankrupt social security and is debt multiple times its GDP. Government is borrowing money to pay into social security because it's all gone, they didn't manage it, they lost it all. And future generations yet to be born will be paying that debt. 

Also, higher taxes mean less incentive to earn income, because you're exerting the same amount of effort but getting that much less. Where do you get productivity from? Productivity is what grows an economy, and brings us the comforts and amenities that we take for granted today. 
I came looking for this quote, hahahah
But remember, just because there are some instances in which privatized water makes sense that doesn't mean there aren't just as many or more scenarios in which privatization is unnecessary at best and predatory at worst.
mine is $90 every month for a townhouse with 3 people and a cat (who I‚Äôll admit IS pretty thirsty)
Fucking where? Mine is ~$120 monthly for a tiny two bedroom, one bath rowhome with three occupants. It skyrocketed after the switch from quarterly billing so horribly that I started hunting for leaks. No leaks, no increase in usage. 
Another Baltimore resident here. Are you on a subsidized plan? The fixed charges on my bill are $31.50 per month alone for the same type of home

My bill averages $60 per mo. Here‚Äôs the breakdown
Account maintenance fee: $3.27
Infrastructure charge: $18.24
Water consumption charge: $8.19
Sewer consumption charge: $21.95
Storm water fee: $5.00
Bay restoration fee: $5.00

Total: $61.65


What gotten better? Baltimore is worse off than ever before. Massive population decline, rampant corruption , a murder rate making it one of the most deadly drug ridden cities on the planet, ridiculous taxes, the water and sewage infrastructure is crumbling.

Whats good? The crab cakes? A few gentrified neighborhoods? 
Dude water is cheap as a mother fucker.   
  

Have you been following Baltimore‚Äôs issues with their police department? One of the popular talking points in the last primary race for governor was firing the entire force and starting over. I‚Äôm not saying privatization is the way to go, but I‚Äôm open to hearing options. 
Can't be any worse than the unaccountable public police departments now.

And there are already examples i.e. private security companies. 
Privatizing police is different. The role of government is to protect the rights of citizens and privatizing police could contradict this. It could lead to an elite bodyguard force for the rich and connected people. This was learned when Andrew Carnegie hired a private police force to use violence against factory workers who went on strike for extremely dangerous work conditions. I think they even killed some people. This private police force became disbanded shortly after. True capitalism is also supposed to create laws to increase competition. Having monopoly‚Äôs ( like carnegie) is not capitalism. 

Having human rights is very important and the government has to protect that. The thing is free speech is not something tangible. It does not cost money to create free speech. It does however cost money to make clean water. In my opinion I would rather leave this to corporations. There are many water companies and they are always competing to make the cleanest and cheapest water. Even adding electrolytes and minerals. It is also 79 cents a gallon at the grocery store. If it gets in the hands of the government the price will not go down. You will pay for it still. Labour costs money. No one is going to clean water for free. 

We both want clean cheap water for everyone. Just a different way of doing it :)
Have you seen the public departments?
At least then they could be sued and fired.
Better? Not necessarily. Sometimes even worse. But if they are pure shit (and haven't worked with government to give themselves a monopoly), they will go out of business. That is the major difference. Profit and LOSS incentives are lacking in state-run enterprises.
I understand the distrust for private enterprises running utilities, but your comparison is a bit disingenuous. Water infrastructure assets can be as much as 75 years old (or older in some places) where fiber infrastructure is maybe 10 years old max (plus it‚Äôs a hell of a lot easier to locate all the assets when they are above ground, which is a big issue for water assets as the plans are often not in digital form and can be damaged) 

Additionally, the bulk of the issues faced by the municipalities are related to a funding gap from poor previous preventive maintenance. The reliance on historical cost as a determining factor for replacement costs has set many municipalities up for failure. You could raise water rates by 10% per year for 10 years and not have enough revenue in some cases to deal with all the problems in the system. 

Beyond that, municipal governments can be highly inefficient, with large stalls and bureaucratic barriers to prevent proactive initiatives. (Just look at an RFP process as an example) Turning to a private firm to manage the asset can have value in cutting through the bureaucracy (as it allows the private firm to assume the transactional costs with acquiring outside expertise), but the trade off is that it can be difficult to hold private firms to compliance requirements. So the value judgement of wanting something more expensive and more inefficient on average with a slightly less chance of corporate corruption is valuable, but becomes moot if the government enterprise becomes just as corrupt, or worse, inept. 

In Maryland specifically there is almost no public funding available to invest in asset management plans to extend the life of these municipal assets. The MDOT has a requirement to develop and implement an asset management plans for state roads based on the EPA requirements from 2013, but those requirements have not transferred to the local government level.

Private isps worked. We have internet everywhere that is much faster than ever before. I have 300mb fiber for 60$ a month from a private company with no competition.  The government overpays and mismanaged just about everything. 
So your answer is more government. When the reason you're upset is because there is a lack of competition, competition which is heavily smothered by, guess who, the government. 

This common shtick I see all the time is that somehow a corporation is predisposed to being more evil than a government, when the corporation relies on satisfying customers to exist in a free market system. Otherwise they're fucked. That's the entire point. The government is the one that actually holds power over you. But this doesn't seem to worry people.
Reddit: "The Trump administration is evil and corrupt!"

Also Reddit: "Lets give the government control of the internet and our water supply!"
Quite a few towns have it. They generally have the best prices and speeds.
Yes. Just like power or water. It's a public utility and should be managed by local communities. It's just laying and managing the lines, something we already do publicly. Public utility companies even have an incentive to expand into more rural areas because they're not seeking a profit. 
Depends on the government. At this point anything's better than Comcast though.
Still confused. If I start a business that sells water I collect, that's illegal? Is it that I can drink it but not sell it? Meaning the state is the de-facto owner of all water and has the sole authority over what can be done with it?

Well that‚Äôs interesting 
Lets go to Baltimore to lay some pipe!
Now I'm starting to feel terrible about swimming in the LR reservoir as a teenager.
Very true.

Infrastructure really should be managed and run by the community (or nation).  The privatizing to save money argument is a total fallacy.  Private companies exist to generate maximum profit for minimum cost/effort.  This is why when infrastructure is handed over to their "stewardship", cost always dramatically increases while over time quality declines.

When public infrastructure is being mismanaged by politicians, communities (and countries) should always take a hard look at what private/corporate interests might be influencing the situation to create a basis to privatize.  Because for many in the private sector, having existing public infrastructure handed over to your "stewardship", is pretty much a free lunch that will feed you for decades.

Ofc lobbyists and the ads you see on tv/internet always claim the opposite of what I've just stated, but the hard data speaks for itself.
JFC, the water bills are so high already. People lose their houses over water bills, I'm not kidding. They are frequently wrong.  The meters are breaking all the time. It's not unusual to suddenly get bills that are hundreds of dollars. You have to fight negligent, stupid city workers to get that fixed and often need the help of a councilman or lawyer. Meanwhile, the city only shows that you haven't paid and puts a lien on your house. You can't pay it because people in Baltimore are broke and fuck that shit. So the city auctions off your house. Water bills in Baltimore are a fucking scam.
Because City run water worked out so well for Flint Michigan.
I've spent quite some time in the county and the tap water tastes like chemicals... Like swimming pool. It's awful and I can't understand how people think it's good tap water. Good tap water doesn't have a flavour, and no chemicals.
If Im not allowed to bankrupt out of student loans, then companies shouldnt be able to bankrupt out of their punishments.
Naw mayne it's an acquired taste. Definitely slightly Rocky/metallic tasting but I mean eh doesn't stop me from drinking out of a water fountain in the parks. After a while I didn't even taste it anymore and had to be reminded about it either by the people who never tasted it or by new transplants to the city. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger my friend. 
Sounds like what Exxon did when it became ExxonMobil. Totally bailed on all cleanup costs for Valdez.  Asspipes.
Yes, 25 litres of a clear unidentified liquid in 5 individual containers.
Could be. It‚Äôs drinkable, it just tastes somewhat like Chlorine and maybe minerals.
Can confirm the water is great. I'm originally from Linthicum and it wasn't until leaving that I knew people that drank from bottled water. 
Mmm that sweet vinyl summertime water!
Hold the fuck up. Did you just say $30 water bill? I pay like 150 or so a month. 
I‚Äôm not.
Really we just need Oklahoma to follow, because I'm not sure how long it will exist on this plain of existence at this rate.
Could you point me to some work on the environmental impact? I‚Äôd like to do some research on the subject and have honestly not found a ton on large scale pollution so far
Natural gas from fracking is the reason the US has achieved more carbon emission reduction than any other country. Pick your poison: small risk or groundwater contamination or burning more coal. 
I'm guessing they're referring to pipes breaking?
Can confirm, Baltimore city water tastes great and is dirt cheap. My water bill for a four person household was $30-$50 per quarter (3 months). I also used to keep saltwater reef aquariums, and part of the process is to purify tap water before mixing in the salt mix. My filters would last multiple times longer than most other people across the country because mine weren‚Äôt trapping much. 

We certainly did have broken pipes and mains pretty regularly though. Anybody remember when that big ass water main broke under Broening Hwy near Old Dundalk and flooded hundreds of houses? I member. 
He‚Äôs probably not taking about water quality. 

Doesn‚Äôt like 35%+ of the water that gets pushed into the system go ‚Äúmissing‚Äù due to leaking pipes?

I believe the city is under a federal mandate to fix and modernize their water pipes at this point.
Yeah it tastes good for city water, but the pipes are 100 years old and made of clay.  
I don't get how so many people think Privatizing this stuff will be good overall.  Short term, yes they might fix some pipes, but long term they will rake the city and it's people over the coals.  The goal of these companies is to make as much money as possible, no matter how unethical or illegal.  Fines are now built into their costs.
Yes. Water main breaks are a plague in Baltimore.
Me too
Well apparently they don't do the best job keeping the water in the pipes
Yes Baltimore has only had issues for a few years
Amen. 

And unsurprisingly, water is where those that got rich from the 2008 recession have started to invest. 
gee its almost as if things needed for survival and health shouldn't be privatized
Amazing how people in power are still getting away with such bs. In the US, you prob couldn't get the citizens to do as much... they'd continue supporting it while paying higher prices all because their favorite politicians still supported their biases. So frustrating. 
In the UK our water is privitised.

I have been informed it is just England and Wales, l hope everything works out for Scotland, they always seem to have better policies than England.
I m not sure if the entire world does that, but I m sure that majority of the world does that.

Sometimes I think when that kind of stuff happens and taxes gotta be raised, there should be a video explanation shared all over the city about why taxes will be raised and how much for what.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs bc ‚Äúwater is free‚Äù but customer pay for the fixed system costs, which need to be paid no matter how much water you use.  Meters are to reduce consumption usually. Sometimes they are to allocate the burden in proportion to use. It gets complicated. 
How much is going to upgrades and repairs however?

A lot of govt run stuff is "cheaper" because they often delay things in order to avoid political backlash due to price hikes.
100 dollar bucks!! Those are the worst kind!
I think its for the city, since the ban will be incorporated into the city charter.

So do I.
[Yup. Baltimore had 341 in 2015, 318 in 2016 and 343 in 2017.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Baltimore) It all started in 2015 when Freddie Gray died. 
This. The city needs to pass a resolution to systematically replace and upgrade the infrastructure, and not just for the water, but sewage and underground power lines at same time, and do it independent of the utility bills. Say for Baltimore and Pittsburgh, replace & upgrade the entire infrastructure of their respective cities, then bottle & sell their own water to pay for it while keeping the public utility prices low and not raising sales or property taxes to do it. Sure it might take a long time to pay if off selling bottled water, but there are other things that can be done to help such as fundraisers. If the wealthy and corporations aren't forced to pay higher taxes to foot the bill, perhaps they'll appreciate that and donate large sums anyway. Get wealthy city leaders to throw fundraisers for friends & colleagues from around the country/world, push to host a Super Bowl to showcase the state of the art infrastructure and use that windfall towards the project. Would also make an enticing location for new businesses and businesses looking for a new home, having state of the art infrastructure and not even have to pay extra taxes to use it.
Besides, no private company is going to charge just enough to fix the pipes. The goal is to make the owners ever so wealthier. 
Add aquarium to the good section.
Water is inexpensive. Treating, pu,ping, and storing water consistantly and reliably is not.
Exactly. Plus the government has no incentive to innovate. If a company fails to innovate for long enough they go out of business. The government is designed to just let people keep doing the same shit over and over again with jobs they almost can't lose. This results in less efficient, more expensive products. The answer is in the free market. Not the overburdened, regulatory captured markets we have for so many sectors that we call "free."
You say that, yet nestle continues depleting the water table unchecked. The 'invisible hand' isn't reliable in the slightest when it comes to basic utilities like water or internet bandwidth.
Except at my parents house in the states where their only option is ~2 mbps for 60 a month. Its been like that for the last 20 years. 

But so glad it works out for everyone 
[deleted]
I have 500kbps for $60/month from a private company with no competition
If the water all works on existing infrastructure, how would there be competition? Legitimate question, not rhetorical.
I don't think you actually want government-run internet, unless you want stagnant speeds, spotty service, and terrible support. If there's no profit in improving the internet service you provide or innovating in some way, it won't be done. There's no incentive for the government to provide you with high-quality internet...so many people would pay more in taxes for internet service and come out with worse internet. 
Owning the rights to a water source is like owning the rights to a music record. It means you're the only one that can derive direct profit from that water source and can prevent others from using it.

For example, in California Nestle owns the rights to a significant portion of the state's water table at a time when the state is experiencing record droughts.

We're not talking about Mom and Pop's Water Business, we're talking about industrial scale conglomerates.

The opposite is what happens in places like Orlando with the Orange Utilities Company, which is run by the city. People buy houses based on whether they are covered by OUC because they offer the best prices and quality. Just across the street, water can cost $60 more per month with the private utility company.

Hey it's better than mine, it has sand in it. Like noticeable amounts of it. In California we can't be that picky though...
Just about every muni water system errs on the side of just a touch of chlorine by the time it reaches a house. Fill a jug, let it sit in the fridge and taste it a day or so or later that day and likely that taste is gone.
$10 a month. Was $20 per quarter before the increase a year or so ago, now it‚Äôs $30 per quarter. When we lived in the city it was about $150 a month.
Me and my wife have found that when you're cleaning you only need to lightly coat problem areas with water and give them a firm scrubbing, instead of filling your house to the brim and letting it all out into the street. It has cut our water bill down by 50,000%.
Yup, for some reason county residents pay massive amounts less than city residents despite being on the same system.
Today a Redditor learns that differences in location and consumption can substantially affect prices.

[From Forbes:](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/17/the-environmental-and-social-impacts-of-natural-gas-fracking/#1da7a1621a76)

>The environmental effects of shale gas are varied - wide ranges of importance and risk level. First, many say that the burning of natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases per unit of energy than burning alternative energy sources like oil or coal, however this may not necessarily be true when observing the full life cycle of natural gas especially taking extraction into account. Second, another key environmental impact is the amount of water needed to access shale gas through hydraulic fracking. Estimates vary, but one study from Duke University found that 250 billion gallons of water was used to extract unconventional shale gas and oil from hydraulically fractured wells in the United States between 2005 and 2014. During the same period, the fracked wells generated about 210 billion gallons of wastewater. Injecting such vast amounts of water into the earth can also cause minor earthquakes, but greater magnitude ones could occur if there is a pre-stressed fault in the same location.

>Another environmental impact is the risk of ‚Äúslickwater‚Äù (a blend of water and added chemicals to improve viscosity) containing harmful chemicals and contaminating water under the ground or migrating upwards through aquifers. This contamination at the development and production stages is extremely dangerous - deep groundwater has a much higher salinity than shallow groundwater, which is fresh, and the two do not mix naturally. In the process of drilling one must be aware of the various aquifers present so the fresh groundwater does not become contaminated by the deeper saline water. The construction of wells in the development stage is the most common method for groundwater and ecosystem contamination when poorly built. A poorly constructed dam gives large potential for fluids to contaminate groundwater and the surrounding environment through fractures in the rock.These are just a few of many plausible negative environmental consequences of extracting shale gas, but some of the most significant environmental impacts even arise from the construction of wells, including accidental spills of oils, drilling muds, and potentially toxic ‚Äúslickwater‚Äù.

You must not live in Maryland and definitely not Baltimore. Hogan has literally taken funding for Baltimore‚Äôs infrastructure and instead chose to invest that money into infrastructure in one of the wealthiest counties in the state, Montgomery County. 

My second favorite part of living Baltimore City is listening to ignorant county dwellers tell me what's wrong with my home. 

My favorite part is not living the county. 
Got a source for that? I'd be interested to read more on it.
For real.  Let's get the goverment involved in agriculture and textiles too; since we need food and clothing.  
England and Wales*

Scotland and Northern Ireland both have public companies that provide all the water.

And, like our trains, it's the most pointless kind of privatisation - the 'minimum' standards and methods of delivery and finance are so stringent that there's practically no room for water companies to do any sort of optimisation.

And of course, you only have one choice of a local supplier. So all the 'competition' is supposed to happen at the tendering stage. Because new water companies popping up is such an easy and common thing...

So we've basically got public water suppliers with private investors skimming profit off the top, with practically no risk.

The free market works best for service provision where you have private investors gambling their money based on their belief that a certain product or service will beat the competition and they'll 'win' their money back.

That doesn't happen in our system.
Scottish Water isn't privatised my friend and is in fact a Statutory Corporation.
I'm from sweden and it baffles me that water privatization is a thing. Everyone needs to have access to clean water, not only where it is profitable and there is no room for corner cutting the water quality to increase profit margins.

But I don't see a lot of complaints regarding this from the US or UK so I guess it works for you guys? :)
I actually don't know of any nation or city that bans privatization of water.

Similar base charge in Minnesota and we have much more fresh water access than most.

$65/mo though is a really good deal when you think about it.  For only 65/mo you get to shit indoors (you can even flush the TP) and you don't have to boil your water before you drink it.  You can shower everyday and wash your cloths and dishes at will.  In addition, they treat the shit water for you before returning it to the watershed.
>I feel like this is a problem in alot of other cities.

>In San Diego, CA I'm paying $65 /mo for water and sewer. Only >$4.60 was actual usage- the rest are "required"/"minimum" fees.

I'm in Denver and water costs $0.003/10 gallons so I use generally under 4 dollars a month(less than 1 in the non lawn watering months) and my total bill is about 680 dollars(55$/month). The cities water purveyor uses that money to employ or contract 15 sewer cleaning crews full time, 6 on-call field repair crews, needs to operate 47 sewage pump facilities to get waste to treatment plant, operate and staff the massive sewage treatment facility, 5 potable water treatment plants and 24 additional distribution pump buildings/water towers, and 3 municipal steam generation and distribution stations. Overall employs over 500 people earning 23-40$/hr wages, has a fleet with over 15 million dollars of vehicles and heavy equipment that needs to be maintained, and contracts out another 150 million dollars per year of expansion, renovation, and repair projects that are necessary to continue distributing water and draining sewage to the existing area and new developmental areas.

How do they pay for that by charging 3/10ths of a cent per 10 gallons of water?


I don't see the "required" and "Minimum" fees as a problem it's a necessary part of living in a community, and ontop of that we live west of the mississippi so the feds heavily subsidised the water our cities pump out to us.

My thinking was more of like companies like Nestle coming in and bottling up municipality water for Pennies the. Selling that water for 1000% more.
Exactly... and the next thing you know the bypass to the airport is a toll road, the interstate to ski areas is a toll road and even the road to get down to Denver is a toll road. And those tolls? They're not going to our government. It's Goldman Sachs if I remember correctly. 
Paul Allen before he died with other investors decided to donate 50 million to help with the homeless problem in Seattle. The city cannot say where that money is. 

They keep throwing money around mismanaging and making their friends money. 

Why did the city of Seattle spend 15 million on one mile of bike lane. 

The Seattle city gov is corrupt. There needs to be better accountability across this state and across the country. The people‚Äôs wealth is being pilfered. Most people have to think twice to go to the doctor for fear of it costing them an arm or leg to fix their arm or leg. 
This is the age of internet, we should be able to see where our money is going. Just like we can see our bank statements on a banking app. 
That's not how utility rates work. In most states private utility companies are governed by a utility commission. Their revenues are approved based on a combination of operating expenses (cost to acquire and deliver commodity) plus return on invested capital. From there, rate structure and customer class are addressed to ensure fairness. 

In other words, utilities are a relatively safe investment. They are virtually guaranteed a certain rate of return on investment. 

You can read more about Washington's UTC [here](https://www.utc.wa.gov/consumers/water/Pages/rates.aspx). 
But it also allows any citizen to create their own business and be able to make a cheaper alternative. Say water is expensive where you live; You figure out logistics, and create your own company, then bid for the contract. If The government has control, they will set a fixed price whether its cheaper or not, and there will not be a chance for an alternative. 
Lol, come on. 

‚ÄúYeah, you might get murdered but there are some cool fish in the aquarium!‚Äù
I believe that an important distinction that gets lost on a lot of people is the difference between being pro-business and pro-free enterprise. Businesses hate competition, so they will try anything to suppress it. And if the state has sufficient power, they will lobby it to suppress competition. Then people will point at this unholy union and say "see, this is why government is superior to privatization." But free-enterprise is the way to keep the businesses in check because their competitors want their profit margin and will always be nipping at their heels.

Milton Friedman changed my perspective by introducing that distinction.
Huh, in France the basic is 10Mo/s for less than 20‚Ç¨/month, and the amount of data is unlimited

And it's roughly the same for phones (I have 20Go  of 4G for 10‚Ç¨/month) which is plenty for me
Lol no

In the UK we have garbage Internet compared to places like Iceland and Sweden because that cunt Thatcher privatised BT and they did nothing to improve the network because they were the only telecoms company.

Monopolization is always bad in my estimation. Whether the monopolizing is done by a private company or by the state tends to make little difference. 

That's always my fear with things like this and I'm hesitant to get excited about these laws without a detailed explanation of exactly what's happening. 

If banning the privatization of something means effectively nationalizing it, that seems a bit like jumping from the pot into the fire to me. 
The city of Baltimore doesnt want to own any more property than it already does I'm sure. Managing abandoned homes is a fucking nightmare.
I will say that I, personally, did not incur debt during my education. I went to trade school. I was trying to make a point where if a student cant bankrupt on education loans, then why should a company be able to bankrupt on legal punishment?

Probably because their jobs and your state economy depend on it not being illegal. 
As an engineering student in Oklahoma, my future career options may depend on loving fracking
I mean, I have found some work done, but not much I found academically credible (braces for downvotes). To quote what I wrote about the first article you cited when it was posted by another commenter: I suppose I'm a little disappointed with this source. I was hoping for something a little more primary research oriented on groundwater pollution. The page you linked to says 'developed by students in the 2012 introductory-level geology and Human Health course' so it's a little dated and doesn't quite meet the academic bar I was hoping for. It was a big deal when fracking began in the Pittsburgh area, where I'm from, but the EPA research I'd seen suggested the process itself wasn't causing any groundwater issues. I was wondering if they'd found something different elsewhere.

In addition to those problems, the scholarly work the page cites isn't about the drilling. Most of the articles cited are not really direct research, either using the risk associated with *potential* contact with fracking chemicals as the baseline, or showing very low increases in cancer risk due to airborne particles, in many cases the risk is elevated by less than many household activities. The only source talking about water table pollution was about the sociological questions associated with the debate, not the science or engineering itself. 

The Forbes article doesn't really prove much to me. It's a quoted Quora answer from a then economics undergraduate student. I say this knowing r/news is going to blast me for not hating on fracking, but this is my problem with science discussions on reddit. I ask for sources that deviate from what I've read academically, and what I'm given in response is lacking in credibility (see the first website you cited written by 100 level geology students or the 2nd written on Quora by an Econ undergrad) or is more mixed and at worst uncertain about the impact (most of the first page of Google Scholar). And then it's topped off by confusion over how I haven't found anything to change my mind about the subject. I don't expect high level debate, but I'd really like the groupthink to occasionally consider things thoughtfully.
Is this what makes my tap water flammable?
Let's assume that that is wholly 100% caused and exacerbated by fracking.

That's a big "So what?"

It has literally no impact on human health or habitability. Nor can such small earthquakes even generally be *felt* by humans. It's literally imperceptible and causes no harm.
Nuclear power - which is also opposed by some - definitely. Investment into solar or wind won't pay off for some time. Shale gas is bridging the gap. 
Natural gas has been (in my un-sourced opinion) a big part of integrating more renewable energy resources into the grid. If a big solar or wind farm goes from 100% output to 20% output because of weather conditions, you need fast, responsive generation sources able to pick up that load, which is what natural gas fed turbines are really good at. 
One is cheaper and quicker to do and Nuclear isn't.They should definitely do long term planning about nuclear,but that doesn't negate the benefits of shale gas fracking.
This sounds paranoid as fuck but these days I honestly just assume it's an account controlled by someone who is invested in water privatization
The Water mains here in Baltimore were put in during the Coolidge Administration. They are over 100 years old and they give out all over the city when it gets below freezing. I have personally seen rivers of water pouring down Charles Street in the winter and I remember one 21 degree night when there were 40 separate main breaks. 

Our basement, due to our street having a water main crack (not our personal pipes) flooded. 

I love Baltimore but the commenter has a point nice clean water to drink. Old ass pipes that blow out all over the city.
ffs that happens in Colorado, and it isn't like our infrastructure is *that* old compared to the East Coast.
It's not free...you pay in other ways(not saying your way isnt better, just reminding everyone that nothing you get is truly free)
Water? Never touch the stuff. Fish fuck in it!
The funding that he took was state money not the cities. It would make more senses for it to upgrade state highways then more city public transportation which just helps those in the city. As someone from the eastern shore neither of these effect me. I‚Äôd rather let each fund there own and give us a tax break

Living in the city (unless you have a fresh condo) means that there‚Äôs gonna be something wrong with your house though. I‚Äôve found plenty of hidden treasures in my 1880 built house. Copper gas pipes lol I still love it tho. It‚Äôs the charm of the city. 
I went baltimore -> denton -> Laurel -> back to more rural shit and I love hearing people who've never lived in the city tell me how awful it is and how everything is trash. Tends to be more from the very obvious closeted racists as well

Welsh Water is owned by a single purpose company with no shareholders and is run for it's customers. I know that technically this is still privatised but they actually invest in our infrastructure and have reasonable prices (imo)
Thanks for the correction, yes I totally agree. It's daft.
The UK has privatisation of water because it works the same as any other utility such as heat and electricity and they have been privatised here in the UK for quite a while now (since Margaret Tatcher in 1980‚Äôs who was extremely pro free market and said government ownership is an inefficient monopoly on resources).  

We have to pay for water bill unless you can‚Äôt afford it and then the government will subsidise the bill so it‚Äôs cost will be reduced or will be free. There are around 18 water providers in England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland‚Äôs water is publicly owned). Prices have risen before and people have complained that they have an oligopoly on the market, but we have an independent commission called OFWAT that monitors these water companies and makes sure they are playing fair for the consumer. 

Overall I would say privatisation has made the water industry more competitive and so more efficient on costs although this can be debated, it has certainly reduced the government expenditure but it has caused some raised rates for middle class households.


There are movements in the US to make it a right so it can't be privatized. Unfortunately one of our political parties disagrees with this. Fyi Cali has water listed as a human right. 
Not to mention waste treatment has a much harder job nowadays due to plastics and other synthetic material in the sewer system

That's assuming a larger corporation doesn't come in, flood the local government<Pun intended> with cash and lobbyists, block out and buy out any smaller companies and charge now that they have their Monopoly or Duopoly.

You know, like they did with Telecom.
For sure. It basically comes down to the fact that large companies can eat certain costs that they know will stifle competition by gutting smaller businesses.

Good! It's bad shit.
I was in Denton when they voted to ban fracking and then it got overturned. Never before had I seen an entire town seethe.
If you‚Äôre an engineer don‚Äôt limit yourself to US onshore. 
If you‚Äôre looking for a book, read The Boom by Russel Gold. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not finished yet, but so far it‚Äôs been straightforward and gives context to the rise of fracking. It‚Äôs not scientific literature or research, it‚Äôs journalism, but so far I‚Äôve found it to be grounded close to the center without being a hoo-rah puff piece for either sides ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù. 

Just go read the amazon synopsis, may be what you‚Äôre looking for.
The reason why you aren‚Äôt finding any scholarly articles refuting the EPA studies is because, to my knowledge, they don‚Äôt exist.  I‚Äôm also from Pittsburgh, and I work in the oil & gas industry (peripherally anyways) as an engineer speccing out equipment for these various well sites and process pads.  The environmental & health impacts of fracking are extremely marginal at worst, and the most widely recognized hazard with the industry coming to town is the massive increase in heavy equipment traffic absolutely destroying roads.  The largest risk of groundwater contamination comes from the risk of a waste water truck crashing en route to a disposal well or treatment facility, before the raw well water has a chance to be treated.  Also, after primary treatment, that waste water is 99.9999% brine water (the .0001% is usually trace radioactive materials like dissolved radon), which is then able to be repurposed versus injected into a well.  For example, the municipal authorities have been using it to treat roads in winter versus trucking salt into the area.

If you have other questions feel free to ask them, I‚Äôll answer them as best as I can.
The problem to some extent is the work hasn't been done.  There's a lot of pushback by industry when it comes to research of potential/expected negative consequences of their work. As such, best practice is to over-value what knowledge we have and what work is done.  Otherwise, you allow the money to control the narrative.

Edit:  Y'all i'm a grad student in geology, I'm not working on environmental stuff but I'm also not talking completely out of my ass here.
Fracking has been around for ages in some form or another. They used to pour nitroglycerin into gas wells to cause fissures way back.

Problem is, you can't count on people **NOT** to cut corners.

Turns out fracking is one of them :/
Natural seepage is a normal thing. All that really proves is there is naturally occurring gas where they decide to drill for gas.

Congrats!

But really, I think it's that before nobody decided to try lighting it on fire when there would be air in the line before the water started flowing. 

This is like when people would see the oil slicks on the beach in California and then blame the platforms out at sea. But it's just something that naturally happens and the platform is there because there's oil, not the other way around.
most likely or someone's farting in your water pipes as a prank.
Our wind turbines pay themselves off after ~8 months of operation.  Not sure where you're getting that info. 
This!

The backups for our grid were based on diesel generators.  Now many have been switched to natural gas, with diesel being the last resort for high demands.  

When sunshine and unicorn farts dont meet the demands, we're better off burning NG that diesel.
I‚Äôve lived near Baltimore my whole life, every once in a while I‚Äôve heard of a burst pipe shutting down a busy/crucial intersection or road but certainly not ever year.

It's free in the sense that I never got a water bill in my life, I can go in any establishment and have water, there are water fountains everywhere. It's free like health Care is free, we pay taxes but I never pay more than that.
Miss me with that gay shit
Thanks for clarifying that. I see what you‚Äôre saying but as a Marylander I think we have great highways to begin with. As a Baltimorean, public transit here is so unreliable and notoriously bad. We could use some help. 
You also implicitly absolved Hogan of blame for letting the would-be crown jewel of his state rot while he basks in high approval ratings for doing trivial things like lowering bridge tolls and not being an open white supremacist

If he's as good a governor as his approval ratings say, he should be working on this shit (pun intended if we're talking sewage)
I lived in the city. Its shit. Get over it.
Some are not so closeted-
This is wrong. A customer cannot choose their water supplier. And if they can, they are an eextreme minority. Nothing about privatisation has made water efficient or competitive. 
That sounds great in theory but I don't think it would translate to the US, mainly because independent monitoring commissions are in the pockets of the big corporations. At least that's how it looks to a European observer!

The horror
Exactly.  You can drill your own well with a cheap state permit and get free water.  That's what Nestle and other do as well.  Water in the ground has 0 real market value.

The value and cost comes from extracting, treating, and then sending it down pipes or filling bottles.  You're not paying for the water, you're paying to get the water to you.
In this state (Colorado) voters have to vote to increase taxes. We voted down a road tax this year. Roads will require maintenance and expansion. Either our legislature increases fees (again, they can't increase taxes without a popular vote) or we're going to end up with even more toll roads. 
So the reason we should trust the government and not private companies is because the government is corrupt?

same here everywhere ive lived in Canada. Two cities everywhere i lived it was included in the rent as it was such a small amount, and one place i lived where i had to setup all of my own accounts for utilities, water cost like $3 or so every 45 days.

jeez these socialized utilities sure do suck eh bud?
No, it does not. 
They can. Many people are on city water.
Not if youre anywhere close to the beltway. You have to get pretty rural in Howard County to start seeing more well and septic.
Yet on election day they vote straight ticket Republican. They either don't understand how the system works or have been brainwashed.
That may be a good book, but that‚Äôs not what he is looking for. He‚Äôs looking for peer reviewed academic studies on the environmental impacts of fracking and no one seems to be able to provide that. 
I will definitely check this out, thanks!
Fracking has been around for a long time and is both high profile and controversial. Exactly the things that attract attention from academics looking to make a name for themselves. You don‚Äôt need approval from industry to conduct geological research, or most other kinds of research. So forgive me if I don‚Äôt find that to be a compelling explanation.
That‚Äôs what regulations are for. There‚Äôs a reason we still don‚Äôt all have lead in our new house paint 
Some areas have had flammable water since the first wells were dug centuries ago, its normal for their ground formations.

Of course, the antis decided to finally video tape it as if it just suddenly started happening.
Same goes for here exempt in ur house. He was just starting you pay in taxes. Likes not like we pay for public water. 
You pay taxes to pay for it...so it isnt free.  

I also get to drink water at establishments and drink at any number of the millions upon millions of drinking fountains in the US without paying a dime for them.  
Baltimore is still 1/10th the population of the state he governs, not every decision has to be about baltimore.

So have I, and I disagree. Sure, its no fun when you wind up in the bad parts of town, but there are many great places in the city.
I agree that there needs to be more competition in the market and OFWAT should be looking at some ways to make regional supply more competitive and to look to give consumers more choice. But, playing devils advocate for private water industry, it has generated 5x more investment and spending in real terms since privatisation, it has lowered government costs on maintaining the water industry and it has taken the utility service out of politics. So for example, the water companies haven‚Äôt been affected by austerity which would have surely cost them investment and money.

So conduct research on private land and on resources that are generally kept confidential, and where results of a study may cause a conflict of interests and profitability? Doesn't seem likely.
You do need funding, and industry isn't going to be providing this funding.  Government research funding is a limited pool that often has political checks on what it gets doled out to.  I'm in geoscience, they don't like giving us money in fucking general.  Climate/enviro groups are notoriously underfunded.
You're correct that Baltimore city's population is almost exactly 10% of the state. The Baltimore Metro area, however, is nearly 1/3 of the state. Some city-dwellers will mock it, but people now have statistically legitimate concerns about experiencing personal violence when venturing into even the nicest parts of the city. This has tremendously negative implications for the Baltimore Metro area's national standing, which affects the entire state.

Even if you ignore the moral implications of letting the city rot, it's a shitty long term strategy for the state. Hogan has the popularity to actually do something to help the city and he's refusing to use it b/c he has no interest in actual hard governing to improve the state. He's basically doing exactly what everyone criticizes O'Malley for doing when he was mayor (fantastically depicted in The Wire).
I live in the county so I don't get a direct say. But I'm near enough to the city that I'd prefer if our governor stopped prioritizing petty bullshit for the Eastern Shore over violence and decay in the city.
Right now? Hell yeah I'd rather visit either place. But Baltimore City has two major sports teams, one of the top hospitals in the world (not to mention several others that are pretty great themselves), several colleges, Under Armour, one of the top aquariums in the world, Acela service to DC Philly and NYC and a dozen other things I'm surely forgetting. Hence my "would-be" point, it needs to fix it's issues with severe poverty, violence and decay.
I believe ere is a currently an initiative for shopping around for water providers for business customers in the UK, which will function similarly to broadband (meaning 'water companies' will buy and sell on services from the current providers and infrastructure owners.)

If it goes well, it may be rolled out to all customers.
How can you say there has been more investment  since privatisation? You would need to know how much publicly owned water would invest now, compared to privately owned water. And we don't have that comparison. Comparing what was invested in the past is not an accurate measurement because things change, technology, infrastructure and lots of other factors make running water supplies today different than running water supplies 30-40 years ago. 
Even worse, we had an amendment on our ballot that would have taxed corporations and individuals making above $150k to fund our schools. We voted against it. Those schools will be built. Those teachers will be paid... and now... well, now the common man is going to foot the bill because the common man votes like a god damned moron. 
It‚Äôs comical. The guy above provides a detailed response as to why he is not satisfied with the citations he has been provided, specifically asks for peer reviewed publications, and the only response is ‚Äúread the amazon synopsis of this book‚Äù.
Random thought but i always wonder what people in frostburg area have to think about the rest of us. 
Hogan is the Governor. Catherine Pugh is the Mayor of Baltimore, go talk to her about fixing up Baltimore.
this was a fun and informative exchange to witness as a non-Maryland resident. 
You should start with the city government not needing a bailout from the state. 
In other words, "We think it's terrible that this situation has existed for so long. We will work hard to make sure Nestle can legally continue bottling California water during this drought."

It's insane that we pump water out of a drought stricken region then bottle it, transport it, and consume it in areas with perfectly good drinking water.
I'm sure it's just a simple clerical error. The bribe check probably got lost in the mail or something silly like that.
>Nestle, the largest producer of bottled water in the U.S., said it monitors its water use and the environment around the springs where water is drawn.

Gosh I hope they are doing as good a job monitoring their own use as they are keeping track of their permits.

Actually this enrages me. It's like you had an expired business license, and instead of getting a fine or shut down, the city came out and worked extra hours to make sure you were issued a new one. Wait - that's exactly what happened.
>The Forest Service faces a backlog of expired permits

If it's a permit for a business then they will work hard for a reissuance.  If it's for an individual they will issue a fine.
Can't wait to see what bullshit excuses will be made to justify issuing a new permit.
I remember when I first graduated from college and I went to a jobs fair.  Nestle was there looking for entry level outside salesman to sell their new bottled water product.  I remember thinking "Nestle bottled water will never last."

Boy, was I wrong.  I underestimated Nestle's ability to manipulate state governments into getting such sweet contracts.  They must be making an absolute fortune.


Can't stop the Swiss billionaire 
Fine?  Is there no fine?...   If that was a person they would be in prison.  
It should be illegal to sell water period, let alone in a plastic bottles that end up littering cost lines all over the world.
It's the farming of foods right? Not the bottling of plastic water bottles. 
[deleted]
more like we will work hard to ensure nestle pays the appropriate kickba....Fine, so that their operations can continue with minimal interruption
Doesn't water bottling make up only a few percent of California's water consumption?

It's still rather silly for them to be able to do so, but refusing to renew to permit would simply mean that all the infrastructure that's been set up would wind up rotting away somewhere or being moved, no?

No, it's insane that 80% of the usage (ag) sees 0% of the scrutiny. 
It's 0.0016% of water used by california. The loss of jobs will have bigger effect.
How could you possibly accuse someone of taking a bribery check? It's cash or gtfo. /s
You're mad that the city came out and did actual work?
Which seems silly, because they could milk big business for larger fines than they can individuals.
Think about the Jobs! Even if it's actively detrimental to society, you can always claim to provide jobs.
Interestingly Nestl√© no longer reports the amount of water it uses, but [this article](http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/07/12/nestle-arrowhead-tapping-water/12589267/) puts it under 750 acre-feet/year (yes that's a ludicrous unit) and according to the numbers in [this pdf from the California government](http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/previous/b160-98/v1ch4.pdf) that's small compared to the state's overall consumption (the PDF puts it in the ballpark of 10 million a¬∑f/y for urban use and 30 million a¬∑f/y for agricultural).
Sorry, do you have a source on this?  Because I can tell you right now that it's not true.
Well they've been operating a business "illegally" for 27 years.  Yeah, fine the hell out of them to start paying for ways to mitigate the drought.
... In B.C. thats about 2 fiddy per million liters.

The premier tried for 3 fiddy but Nestle called her a "wide vagina having tater tot" and said no.

I'm going to bathe naked in their water supply today.

2 fiddy for taint water.
>Doesn't water bottling make up only a few percent of California's water consumption?

Maybe, but California is dealing with having something like only 5% of their usual water.  So exporting water from a drought area doesn't make sense, and a company having a water bottling plant in an area that has droughts doesn't make sense either.


One of the reasons so many companies bottle California water is because California doesn't regulate groundwater. If bottled water is the issue that gets CA to finally regulate groundwater, it will have effects on many more industries (and probably result in plenty of infrastructure not being used). 

Bottling? No, that makes up a rounding error in California's water consumption, not a few percent.
You would think they would buy us dinner first
> Poisoned neighbors? Just shoot them


You're leaving this untapped for profit.

Or we can stop growing almonds. But that's not an emotional-cry-baby-circle-jerk-reddit-style argument. 
Yea I know, that's why I said we do this. If people didn't buy this shit they wouldn't be doing it. I really just hate bottle watered in the US
The government didn't create the drought, but the government allowed (and subsidized) agriculture‚Ñ¢ to grow crops in the desert. You do the math.
Is bottled water a percentage of that 80%? What is your source?
What is your source for that? According to [this](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/bottled-water-california-drought) Mother Jones article, "companies aren't required to publicly disclose exactly where their sources are or how much water each facility bottles," so I legitimately don't know how anyone is quantifying it.
Thanks for posting the stat, I figured it was low but that is some idiocracy (the movie) logic right there. We shouldn't be wasting resources to waste resouces especially if it causes damage to the environment
I figure these days even having proof of bribery (i.e. a paper trail) doesn't actually mean anything, so why bother with the hassle of large sacks of cash when a plain ol' check will do just fine?
In Texas during summer they can give you water in a cup but only if you ask. That might be what he means.
I believe it's tree fiddy.
It makes a lot of sense from a business standpoint, especially from a company that wants to privatize water, and believes it is not a basic human right. Source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEFL8ElXHaU
They are probably planning to take water from Californians then sell it to Californians
Additionally, exporting water from an area prone to extreme forest fires makes little sense, and could even be a significant contributing factor to the fires as vegetation becomes dry due to interferences with it's water source.
Yes that is true but making that big of a stink about 0.0016% of water being used is going to solve zero problems. The job losses will have a bigger effect on the citizens of California then stopping the use of that water.
> California doesn't regulate groundwater

California actually passed groundwater regulations in 2014. It's called the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), and beginning in 2017, it will regulate 127 of 515 groundwater basins in CA.

>Final Basin Prioritization findings indicate that 127 of California's 515 groundwater basins and subbasins are High and Medium priority. These basins account for 96% of California's annual groundwater pumping and supply 88% of the population which resides over groundwater basins. The remaining 388 basins are Low and Very Low priority and comprise 75% of the groundwater basins in the State. [Source](http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/casgem/basin_prioritization.cfm)


Unfortunately, the basin that the Nestle/Arrowhead plant is pumping from (basin #7-21.04, part of the Beaumont Basin) is in [overdraft](http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/casgem/pdfs/lists/SRO_BasinName_05262014.pdf) and would be regulated under the law, except that it is already an "[adjudicated](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1310075/groundwater-legislation.pdf)" basin, meaning the courts have decided how the groundwater there gets to be used, and it is thus exempt from the SGMA. Also, because the Nestle pumping station is on an indian reservation, [who are exempt from reporting water usage to the water agency who managers the basin](http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/07/12/nestle-arrowhead-tapping-water/12589267/) nobody knows how much water that plant has pumped since 2009 when they stopped reporting their pumping info to their local water agency.

There are 26 adjudicated basins in CA, as listed in the [SGMA](http://opr.ca.gov/docs/2014_Sustainable_Groundwater_Management_Legislation_092914.pdf)
I wouldn't be drinking bottle water if they weren't pumping toxic industrial waste into our water supply (see fluorosilicic acid).
I don't think you understood me, 80% of water usage in CA is agricultural, bottled water is probably a fraction of a percent of that 20% remainder. Yet we don't hear about agriculture, we hear about golf courses, bottled water, and other uses that are easy to shit on but negligible in reality. 
Oh, I found it. The source for that number is [Nestl√© itself](http://www.nestle-watersna.com/en/nestle-water-news/statements/nestle-waters-north-america-water-management-statement), and is just about their plant in Sacramento: "In other words, we use less than two thousandths of one per cent (0.0016%) of Sacramento's total water demand."

Ha fair enough
So it's just that you only get your glass of water if you ask for it, instead of immediately?  I mean... that's not a bad policy for ANYWHERE, drought or not.  And it's a far cry from "prohibits restaurants from offering their clients A CUP of water"
Slavery makes sense from a business standpoint.
This is a good point. The drought will actually increase demand within California--meaning that there has never been a better time to bottle and sell water from a business perspective.
http://www.bottledlifefilm.com/index.php/the-story.html

Your statistic comes directly from Nestl√© and is about Sacramento, not California as a whole. If there is no water, no one will have a job in California.
Just be glad you don't get your water from a river full of barges.
I think I did understand you, I was trying to put it in context. Without knowing what percent it is or isn't, or whether it's part of the 80% at all, doesn't provide much context to this discussion. Plus, if it is part of ag, then isn't this article scrutiny? 

I've read that commercial bottled water facilities don't have to report how much water they use, and that bottled water pulled from the ground from Indian reservations isn't monitored. I doubt anyone can say what percent of  CA water is used for bottled water. I've also read that California is one of he major suppliers of bottled water to the nation. I think it's a big deal.

Also, ag is 80% of the water set aside for human consumption, which as a whole is less than water set aside for environmental uses ([source](http://www.familiesprotectingthevalley.com/news.php?ax=v&n=10&id=10&nid=394), [source](http://californiawaterblog.com/2011/05/05/water‚Äîwho-uses-how-much/)), so water used for ag is somewhere between 46-62% depending on how you measure it. That second report also shows that water use in ag has been steadily declining while urban use is increasing.

Plus, we eat that stuff. I'm pretty sure we shouldn't be growing rice in California, but I directly benefit from eating California-grown food, and I'd rather put a brick in my toilet than eat less.

The more I hear people shooting from the hip about California Agriculture usage and the more I look into it, the more I find confusing facts. I've read reports that say that changing irrigation methods might have an effect on water quality, but not much on usage. I've heard people say that CA has a "use it or lose it" water allocation law, but I haven't found anything about it.

Bottling ground and tap water to send out of state (or even in-state) seems pretty cut and dry though. Let's stop that; it's dumb. Throwing in a random statistic about agricultural water usage into the discussion is just distracting.
and it doesn't matter if they were taking a small fraction of that number -- exporting ANY water from a drought area is ethically and morally indefensible -- everyone keeps saying "what about ag"! as if the ag travesty means Nestle should get a free pass.  Why?  the two are separate issues.  and even .0016 (even that's a truthful number) is a LARGE amount of water.
Yup, if you click through on that article, you'll see the source for that number is Nestl√©
Yes, that's exactly how it works. Yes, some drought restrictions are probably just good practice all the time. Yes, people will still complain and blow them out of proportion.

I really can't blame nestle for taking advantage of a very favorable buisness arrangement the state gave them.  These water permits seem like a steal, something that can allow you to gouge the public in the event of a drought for a minimal cost.  What's bizarre is how the state is essentially giving water rights away, something that will cost the taxpayers great sums in indirect costs, and getting jack shit in return.  What good businessman WOULDN'T take advantage of such government incompetence.
We don't need no stinking BARGES
Well I can now say that I'm probably just as confused as you are.

Still, a lot of dumb shit happens, the question is whether or not it's worth pursuing. A quick Google search indicates the USA as a whole drinks ~10 billion gallons of bottled water a year, some more led me to find that, at least in 2010, California withdrew 38 billion gallons PER DAY. So by a very worst case estimate, bottled water is 0.072% of the problem. 

Edit: clarification, 10 billion gallons BOTTLED water a year 
I hate how people keep saying that they don't have to stop watering their lawns because "Farms take more water!"  Well no shit, but your lawn with imported European grass isn't feeding half this country.  Cutting the unnecessary stuff should always be the step taken before letting crops die and affecting food supplies and prices for the rest of the world.
So they could be off by 100 times and it still would be the lowest issue on the totem poll. Hating corporations won't solve this issue.
Unethical, yet true.
There are still people behind that company that made these morally reprehensible decisions. The logic behind the "any good business would take advantage of the opportunity given them argument" is the same as "but if I don't do it, someone else will anyway." Nobody buys that argument for the most obviously immoral acts like rape or murder. They shouldn't buy it for lesser immoral actions. There's no line where that argument becomes any less stupid. 
A human one?
> I really can't blame nestle for taking advantage of a very favorable buisness arrangement the state gave them.

Of course you can. Rights trump utilities (in more than one sense).

> What's bizarre is how the state is essentially giving water rights away, something that will cost the taxpayers great sums in indirect costs, and getting jack shit in return.

It's not bizarre, it's corruption.

> What good businessman WOULDN'T take advantage of such government incompetence.

Good is a moral term, so I guess you mean which morally corrupt businessman wouldn't refuse this, instead. A moral businessman would refuse such a project. Wtf, are business people from hell in your perspective? Without moral scruples?
I'm still dubious of those numbers given the lack of reporting required. Even at that number, it's worth pursuing. 

Using less water to grow food is a complicated problem. Stopping Nestl√©, Coke, and Pepsi from sending ground water and tap water out of the state is a no-brainer. It's worth pursuing.
Have the people suffer to clothe thing king. of course! that's clearly the answer!
We could demand they plant water efficient crops like fruit trees instead of nuts or alfalfa. The country can be fed just as well on what it can produce sustainably. 
what will solve it?

edit - I'm not saying you're wrong, I don't think it'll solve the problem either. I think it's one of a lot of things we'll have to do.
There is something to be said for holding the government officials who agreed to this responsible too, though.
Since it's painfully obvious you have never had a real job, in the real world "business people" (whatever that is) do not wake up and think "what evil can I do today?" They do not ponder all the ways they can enslave humanity as they are making their morning coffee. They do not derive an immense sense of pleasure from the suffering of others.

What likely happened is that Nestle and California arrived at some kind of agreement when water was plentiful. Nestle probably did a study of various markets to determine reliability of access to water, pricing, etc. and then made a decision on California because it was somewhere between best value and largest profit (contrary to what you believe, maximum profit is not the only driving factor in the business world).

This agreement has likely been in place for a while now and is apparently expired. The people who initially set it up have probably moved on to other companies or have at least changed positions within Nestle. The project now is probably run by a project manager who makes a good, but not excessive, salary and is married with 2-3 kids with a house in the suburbs. This PM probably shows up and hopes to do a good job to receive a raise or promotion or at least acquire good experience and a recommendation for a job at another company in the future. This PM is probably more worried about some upcoming crazy weekend where one kid has a game, another has some kind of practice, and the third wants to visit a friend while at the same time wanting to get some stuff done around the house that has been put off for too long due to a lack of free time. 
They're exporting less than a tenth of a percent, at best, how much is nut farming exporting again? Rice? Alfalfa? I bet they're all whole numbers. 

Pursuing things is all well and good, but it costs time and money, better to spend it on things that matter, rather than pursuing idealistic principles. 
>  Even at that number, it's worth pursuing.

Not necessarily.

I own a pickup. Does it make sense for me to drive down the street to save a penny per gallon on gas? Let's say I'm low on gas, so I'm going to get 20 gallons. That's 20¬¢ savings! But if I get 15mpg and gas is $2.50, that means I can go less than a fifth of a mile before I've spent 20¬¢ on gas to get there - and then I have to drive back! So unless it's on my way somewhere, I waste money saving a penny on gas.

0.072%? That's like the difference between gas being $2.49‚Åπ at one gas station, and $2.49‚Å∑ at another gas station.

Do you really want to pursue "cheaper" gas at that rate? Something that would save you 4¬¢ for a full 20-gallon fillup? Or would you rather do something like maybe talk about trading in the pickup for a car, or trying to do repairs on it so maybe you get 18-20mpg instead of 15mpg?
Seriously? You think not being able to have a water-intensive and well-manicured lawn is suffering? You would *suffer* without it?
Force conversion from flood irrigation to drip irrigation. Limit the use of sprinkler irrigation to only the required germination time. Salt Water desalination plants. Removal of lawns in favor of desert landscaping (If the lawn is needed use reclaimed water). Pipe in water from other states. 

A good chunk of California is a desert. People have to stop acting like its the tropic with water usage. Las Vegas is a good example of the right path.

But if they open water desalination plants, California may even turn it into an industry. Exporting water to the rest of the west.  
> Since it's painfully obvious you have never had a real job, 

Oh wow, you know so much about me. Quit stalking me! 

>in the real world "business people" (whatever that is) do not wake up and think "what evil can I do today?" 

That is exactly my point... Business people *do* take into account morality, and it is against morality to make a water business in a drought area.
At this point we have more time and money than water.

Edit: and yes, we should probably grow and export less food as well.
This is like losing money to stop and pick up a quarter.
It takes bottled water companies 1.6 liters of water to produce 1 liter of bottled water. By your reasoning, yes it worth not making bottled water.
I agree with most of what you say, and I also think that it's a good idea for us to change our ground water regulations such that we aren't so attractive to bottled water companies - and those same regulations will also force a lot of other efficiency as well.
I don't know if you've been keeping track of the snow caps but you don't have much time either :)

Science says you're sol by the end of the year.
Congratulations on saving 4¬¢. I'd rather try and save hundreds of dollars.
Look what that bottle water company does is take less then one percent of that water. Walk out to your car and grab the spare change in there. That amount of change will effect your yearly income as much as forcing that company out of cali. Not to mention you will fuck over a few thousand employees. 

You want to remove Nestl√© because you hate corporations not because it will help the situation. 
Hopefully their candy will get better.
This was a smart move on Nestle's part.

- Chocolate crops are in dire straights as climate change gets worse.

- Sugar is considered poison to many and there hasn't been an alternative that is good enough to replace it.

- Nestle now has the money necessary to invest in new brands that are more likely to thrive. 

They are shit when it comes to their water policy but this was smart.
That and free up cash to buy water reservoirs in the states for pennies on the dollar. 
"Unfortunately, the original article that sparked the media interest in our cocoa project contains inaccurate information," Megan Hochstrasser, science communications manager at UC Berkley, told DW. "Chocolate is not 'on track' to go extinct in 40 years."

http://www.dw.com/en/no-we-wont-run-out-of-chocolate-by-2050/a-42037236
Well, why sell candy when the profit margin for water is so much higher? 
Yep. I think the pendulum is swinging towards sugar being the real killer, and not fat.
Business Insider is a clickbait crap and everything they produce should be double checked
"Parents in one California community are fighting for answers after at least seven children were diagnosed with cancer in the past four years. Earlier this year, they¬†fought to remove a cell phone tower¬†from a local elementary school campus. Now, they're focusing on a chemical in their drinking water supply that's linked to cancer. And Ripon, California, is just one of dozens of cities across the country dealing with the possibly harmful chemical. ¬†¬†
...
The regional water board has asked Nestle to do additional vapor testing to ensure TCE levels are within new, stricter guidelines set by the state.¬† Nestle says the work plan has been submitted and approved by the water board."
> Ripon was once home to a Nestle plant that used trichloroethylene, or TCE, to decaffeinate coffee until the 1970s.  Nestle discharged the plant's wastewater into the city's sewers. TCE was recently found in one of five city drinking water wells.

What a surprise.
>Nestle

*Warning sirens in the distance*
[removed]
So sad, sucks they blamed the cell phone tower though...  hopefully some scientists can get over there and figure things out.
Ripon isn't an isolated town, it's part of the Modesto to Stockton sprawl.
Time to get Erin on the phone!
Just Nestle doing some testing...
Fortunately, the EPA hasn't had a need to update [Water Quality Standards since 1983](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=454a7b51118b27f20cef29ff071c1440&node=40:22.0.1.1.18&rgn=div5#sp40.24.131.d) - bc, there isn't anything new to report /s
Goddamnit I need more coffee...

I read this as "parents eye chemical in city water gives children cancer"

Immediately wanted to know what chemical in your eye causes cancer, and how it got into the water in the first place
What‚Äôs a ‚Äúparents eye chemical‚Äù?
They could have tested the water first and more easily. They just wanted to get rid of the tower.
The only thing i have ever cared about is pollution.  After doing more research, looks like more recent data, shows even more reason for suspicion of 5g raidiation. Studies show that there has been links to heart tumors in rats, the fact that where they are using trees only one side of the tree is dying, and a new law FCC 18-133, stripping cities rights to a forum to vote on placement of towers. I am sorry, but where there is smoke, there has to be an ember. Even if 10% of this info is true, why wouldnt more people be upset, THEY are putting them in OUR TREES! We as a people, we have to stop sick tech advancement, for the sake of advancement only.  There are several types of waves being emitted from very low to very high.  We have to the watchdogs, because no one else will.  This seems to be mostly happening in California, so if you dont live near by, you probably arent aware of how serious this is to all of us. Increase of wildfires too, at the same time, weird huh?!

And to those that called me an idiot, moron, or a troll, grow up please and do some homework.
Maybe they should leave California since there are so many substances ‚Äúknown to the state of California‚Äù to cause cancer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

In all seriousness, this sucks. I hope they find answers and someone is held accountable to fix the issue.
Geez, California and it's water... They Barely have any and when they do, it's not safe.
Oh yeah, well the ny times, wrote about it, so that must be the whole story. Feels like a great puff piece, while we all use our phones, eat poison foods, and drink contaminated water and argue over petty shit, while the billionaires get theirs. Not an anti-vaxer or a flat earther, just to be clear. Also our skin does protect us, but we are all made up of 80% water, so why dont yall check some shit out first, but that would require, putting your phones down. Also they say you can drink roundup too, so it must be good for you! Drink up the lies, keep swallowin the truth down!
It probably isn‚Äôt related but so many people on the west coast that I know are getting sick with mystery illnesses.. a couple dying as a result. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it but I could definitely see the water being a possibility. But maybe that‚Äôs just a conspiracy theory.
What about decaf coffee? Is there TCE in that too?
Cell phone (5g) towers are very dangerous to our health. The companies know all of this as well. They try to put them in places, that once constructed, are hard to remove. Public property, city property, schools and firehouses, etc.. lots of red tape. Firefighters have won lawsuits to remove them because once constructed they had adverse effects. Sleeplessness, migraines, memory loss, motor function loss, and many more symptoms. They finally won and some houses have gotten them removed or blocked, due to missed calls and basically the entire staff not being able to function properly. 

Pretty scary. Companies will do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whomever they want until someone stops them. There is no "something" that will stop them, only someones, because people are who can make the difference.    Not time, not knowledge, not common sense can save us for them, only ourselves can do that.

I feel very sorry for them and hope they find the answer soon. I hope we all do.
Never thought I'd see an article that reinforced my refusal to drink water.
It's the vaccines! Haven't you learnt yourself about the vaccine!?            
Fucking children murdering cunts.
What size of community are we talking about here?

Is 7 kids in 4 years out of that size group near the national average?
Sounds like a fishing expedition. First you think its a cellphone tower, now its the water, next it'll be the paint in a school complex or some other explanation.
> Earlier this year, they¬†fought to remove a cell phone tower¬†from a local elementary school campus.

Sure sounds genetic as in the parents have brain cancer.
They asked Nestle. Wow
But Nestle provided local jobs!
They'd sell bottled cancer if they could.
Imagine what they would find if they did a 100% spontaneous synchronized raid at every nestle HQ. 

Also. We need to get rid of the statute of limitations for white collar crime and make evil actions by a Corp automatically pierce the corporate veil.
Reddit... ASSEMBLE.
I definitely read it as an "eye chemical" in the water and wtf'd for a good ten seconds.
I'm sure they will be very motivated to study something else accused by people who think a cell tower gives kids cancer.
I actually "met" her once. She came to my city to do a speech/presentation thing. Got a selfie with her. It's somewhere in the depths of my pic folder lol.
For anyone who doesn't get the reference:

Erin Brockovich (born Pattee; June 22, 1960) is an American legal clerk, consumer advocate, and environmental activist, who, despite her lack of formal education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in 1993.

At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight corrosion. The waste water was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some percolated into the groundwater...

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich)
"We investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong."
Ok, so not just me? ...usually it's just me :)
That part of the sentence is saying that the parents are looking at or considering chemicals in the water as the potential source. "To eye" something means to look, to consider, to question
Needs more sheeple.
I used to work at a superfund site out in Arizona when I was first starting college.

I don't know about the entire west coast, but many of the areas that experienced a "boom" in the 70's and 80's, particularly technology manufacturing, now have contaminated water tables.  This is because nobody really understood the implications of using volatile agents in industrial processes (such as those used to make superconductors, microchips, electronics, etc) and then just dumping them out on the ground.

Once the issue was realized, it was too little too late.  Treating water table contamination is expensive and often wasteful.  (At my site, we literally pumped millions of gallons of water out of the ground, stripped it, and then dumped it into a canal.)
West Coast also had smog issues for decades.  The mountains keep the winds from blowing across, which concentrates the air pollution there.
They stopped using it in the 70s.  Now they use dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, or supercritical CO2.  The last one is the most preferable, and ethyl acetate is the next most preferable.  I'm not too keen on DCM, but at least it has a low boiling point, so it should be possible to remove the last traces of this carcinogenic solvent.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/science/5g-cellphones-wireless-cancer.html
If you‚Äôve got a source for 5G cancer, that‚Äôd be great.
They are not dangerous.  You are an idiot.

Just like the anti-vaxers, anti-GMO, and flat earthers.  

Bunch of morons.
None of this is true.

There are cell towers all over the US and the world, yet you hear about none of this.  They are often constructed on commercial and public land because profits are shared with the landowner, so the city/state finds it beneficial and no public hazard for it to be placed on their land.
> I feel very sorry for them and hope they find the answer soon. I hope we all do.

You're an idiot.
Obvious troll is obvious.
Oof, don‚Äôt talk about cellphone towers. Anyone who badmouths the ‚ÄúI need gigabit speeds on my cellphone‚Äù crowd gets crucified.
So what do you drink that doesn't have water in it?
Downvoted for not hydrating. Do you like IVs?
Childhood cancer is rare. According [to this](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-in-children/key-statistics.html), 11,060 kids under 15 will be diagnosed with cancer this year. For that many kids, under 10, in one school, to get cancer, seems outside the norm. There's 89,000 elementary schools in the US, so there should be on average 1 cancer case per every 10 schools or so.
If you follow the link to the cell tower article it says 4 kids within one elementary school. 1 brain cancer, 1 kidney cancer in 2016 and it doesn't mention the other 2 types which were diagnosed this year. 447 kids currently attend that school.
My thoughts exactly.
The cell tower thing is tin foil at best, but chemical irritants/contaminants can certainly cause cancer.
To be fair, TCE can cause liver cancer.
Yeah was gonna say, the action against the cell tower is going to hurt their inevitable civil lawsuit even if it does turn out to be the water.
Some fish are worth fishing for...
only if it already came free out of the tap
I'm sure there's some cross stock ownership between Nestle and Marlboro, so the folks that control them are probably already selling cancer.
Imagine a just world.
oh, i know, i just like to bust on shitty headlines. thanks tho!
They drink oil. It comes right out of the ground. It must be healthy.
Not if they are cousins.  

Child cancer is predominantly genetic.  

I would assume the mother was exposed to something during pregnancy before the child being exposed now, though yes that could be the water.  Though now that the kids are in school goodluck finding evidence.
Are they related?
Especially since cellphone towers are directional, and having one on your roof means you are actually the one with the least exposure in the neighbourhood.
Liver cancer is essentially unheard of in children. It‚Äôs also telling that they never specify which cancers these seven kids had. If it‚Äôs seven rare cancers (such as liver) I‚Äôd be inclined to think there‚Äôs a link. If it‚Äôs seven of the more common childhood cancers (eg leukemia, kidney) I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a bullshit anti-science movement.
tO bE fAiR
Not when you're just flailing your net around.  Every 'cast' makes you less and less credible.
Sell bottles of tobacco smoke for those who are too lazy to breath themselves.
Doesn't sound like it - it didn't have much info on the 2 kids diagnosed this year, but the first two were mentioned as classmates.
I am going to take some wild shots in the dark here.

If the kids or parents grew up in this community (or in nearby communities), and the average size of the elementary is less than 500 kids... there is an *extremely* good chance they're related.  They may not be "first cousins" related, but I bet quite a lot of students share a great-grandparent or great-great grandparent.

Also, statistics don't have to occur evenly across the country.  It's unusual, but having multiple cases of childhood cancer in one town could simply be really shitty luck.  

The simple fact is, childhood cancer in general is poorly understood.  Not even 2 (?) years ago, a study came out linking childhood lymphoma with *over cleanliness* combined with a genetic factor and it's still not something anyone can really pin down.

....

I am going to admit here that I became extremely dubious when it was brought up the same group of parents also pushed for the removal of a cell tower.  Your kid probably bathes in more radiation just walking to school under a bunch of transformers and old power lines.
this sounds like anti-vax, anti-scinece, pro-alternative medicine. it doenst not need to be specifically liver cancer, if they all had the same cancer, we would be suspicious.
tell that to parents with sick children
Screw that, give me Tomacco!

Nestle. sustainable. LOL yes I'm sure one of the top 5 most villainous multi-national conglomerates in the world has only the best intentions for the environment at heart. That is rich.
You have to love how Nestle sites their own "research" to assure the public they aren't doing any damage....

They are a total joke.
those considered a high risk to cause an adverse environmental impact were charged the highest rate. If they are considered high risk, why allow it at all? Stick to low risk, and be happy we allow it. Plenty of other water companies would happily buy those permits for more, and pay a more reasonable rate. A Canadian owned business, perhaps.
Before clicking on the link, I assumed this bottling plant must be located in the southwest where water is scarce.   

Ontario is bordered by three Great Lakes.  These lakes make up the worlds largest fresh water supply. 

I did not know that municipalities charge money for entities to pump their own water out of the ground.  

As a homeowner with a well, I'd be angry if the .gov wanted to charge me for using water out of my own well.  
This needs to happen more. Part of our crisis in CA is caused by Nestle demanding and taking water from our reservoirs at insanely low prices and then SELLING it.

They're basically profiting off the public.

Now add on top of this places like Hetch Hetchy, which are LITERALLY national treasures.  Hetch Hetchy is literally Yosemite's twin.

That's what it it looked like BEFORE they flooded it.

Note that it was ALREADY protected as a national forest at the time.

We could drain it for $0 and return it to nature. However, every time we get into a position to pass a ballot measure to drain it the lobbyists come in and fuck things up.

People should really learn more about industrial water usage.

https://www.ontario.ca/page/water-taking-report-and-charges

And then take a moment to read the facts.  For ontario; Any phase 1 water tarif is 3.71$ per million litres.


The problem with taking too much water is whether or not the aquifer input/output is regulated correctly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSF79uS3t04

Isaac Asimov video for a nice interesting debate on the subject.


Unfortunately; I'm not anywhere near informed enough to guess in regards to aquifer data and would suggest finding the info from someplace.

http://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency  to start.


Just a heads up.  I'm only against the "press" in that you are citing the big name heavy hitter only; instead of getting riled up at the 3.71$ price tag to begin with.
Are there any candidates who will stop this from happening? Local or national? I'm not going to hold my breath for nestle to stop out of the kindness of their own hearts obviously. What can we do to stop this?
Now if only California would pull it's head out of it's ass and stop Nestle from taking our water.
If you're going to sell off public resources, for god's sake why can't they do it at real market value? If they can get X in retail market..that sets a standard for what its worth. Anyone buying water for re-sale..should pay a fair value. We need to charge accordingly.
[deleted]
What the fuck does Kathleen Fucking Wynne know about inappropriate?  I wouldn't put it past her to pay Nestle to take "extra" ground water like she does with electricity.
Why is everyone compaining abouy Nestle and nobody about farmers?
Unfortunately the resources here in Canada are so plentiful that we're not very good at guarding them. 
They pay 1/1000th of what the public does and re-sell that water at an ungodly markup.  I don't even want to try to do the math there.

They should pay significantly higher rates.  Private, for-profit use is not the same as domestic use.
Adidias reformed. Why doesnt nestle?

lol even the high risk permit only costs them $3000. I feel like these dollar values haven't been adjusted for inflation in decades. 
Because Nestle ~~bribes~~  lobbies our politicians.
Bottled water operations constitute a negligible portion of California water use. Not saying Nestle shouldn't pay a higher rate, but the drought is basically irrelevant to this particular issue.
If you drain the Hetch Hetchy what source will be used to replace it?
> Part of our crisis in CA is caused by Nestle demanding and taking water from our reservoirs at insanely low prices and then SELLING it.

not water intensive agriculture in the middle of arid landscape that takes up around 40% of total water consumed, but Nestle with their 0.008% share? It's not Nestle that dries out the Colorado River before it can reach the sea, it's the retarded policies in the whole southwest pretending that water is infinite.

And don't they sell water for drinking? Surely that's the highest, most "noble" form of water consumption, so where is there problem exactly?
The market value of well water is typically zero dollars if you own the well.  
No, but if they have to pay more for it, who do you think is gonna be ponying up the cash? You and the worker, not the board members. 
This isn't Ontario, California. It is Ontario, Canada. 
Be little more specific please..I work with farmers every day. They work hard and pay their fair share of taxes, and permit fees to get access to public resources. They live in our neighborhoods, send their kids to our schools, eat at our restaurants, they invest in our towns..they're part of our community. They pay income tax, property tax..etc.

Well yeah, those parties who would have their costs go up would rather spend 90% of what the fines would sensibly be on lobbying and super PACs than pay that further 10%, and odds are the lobbying doesn't cost that much since it is easy to get people against "undue burdens on business" and "government fees driving up costs!".


The point isnt whos causing more of the problem.  The problem is ths: Paying way too little for a public resource and then profiting from selling it smacks of corruption.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/04/03/agriculture-is-80-percent-of-water-use-in-california-why-arent-farmers-being-forced-to-cut-back/

Nestle is using a fraction of the water used in agriculture.


Go cash that check now boy.
Tough.  That's the cost of doing business.  Too expensive to take our water and do business (if rates are raised and rightly so)?  Fine.  Go elsewhere, Nestle.
I'll go out on a limb and say that whining about something that constitutes 0.008% of a problem is missing the forest for the trees so hard that it deserves at least an honorable mention in the Guiness Book.
Let's say you stopped the mustache twirling villains at Nestle selling potable water to the masses in their tracks - congrats, you have 99.992% of the problem to go.

Pretty much the whole agricultural sector also pays too little for a public resource and has a significant share to boot, unlike Nestle, while having not that much to show for as far as GDP is concerned. Why don't you start there? It's where the biggest returns on efforts are.
I don't think Nestle has said they'd be against an increase in permit fees. Quote they're giving reporters is a dodge, followed by  "Nestle is committed to sustainable and environmental yadda yadda". Doesn't sound like they're going to fight it since they've been getting water for nothing for so long.
Except we need food to survive as much as we need water, so if water isn't cheap, then neither is food. Since you can't live on water alone, it makes perfect sense for discounted usage of water for agriculture. What makes very little sense is the re-packaging of a public resource in exactly the same form, at a higher price, for profit.
except you don't have to grow water intensive crops in the middle of arid land during draughts.   
The huge part of water used to water the fields simply evaporates without doing anything of value, but given that it's cheap as fuck for farmers, next to nobody cares about efficiency of watering techniques and the crops themselves.  
If you have complaints about discounted price Nestle is paying, you should also complain about farmers whose share of water usage dwarfs everything else. And since when are almonds a staple food that would justify subsidies?
Farmers grow more than just almonds dude..I kind of believe farmers come in handy around dinner time. 
They also pay taxes, pay fees, permits etc, they actually add infrastructure, improve their properties, live in our communities and go to our churches and schools. They provide jobs..they provide products that provide many with jobs. I personally need farmers a lot more than I need overpriced bottled water..in fact I don't need any bottled water.. 
> Farmers grow more than just almonds dude..I kind of believe farmers come in handy around dinner time.

Non-essential cash crops, non-essential cash crops everywhere...    
And I don't see you addressing the argument that maybe, just maybe you are not supposed to grow whatever you feel like in arid places by flooding them with scarce water and that maybe, just maybe you should rather focus on something that fares well in the climate while being less water demanding. Maybe paying more attention to calories/gallon would be wise. 

This insanity of treating water as dirt cheap infinite resource is clearly shown by the fact that a river as big as Colorado River is sucked dry before it reaches the Gulf of California. Yep, totally sustainable approach to water management.

> in fact I don't need any bottled water.. 

Other people self evidently do, given the fact that Nestle supposedly makes bank on it.
And by the same logic you don't *need* almonds, grapes, watermelons, nutritionally useless lettuce, and dozens of other things grown in California en masse. Corn and soy from Iowa should be enough.
Wow so for only $524/yr I can drain an entire national forest of its water?

>The defendants named in the lawsuit also include Regional Forester Randy Moore and San Bernardino National Forest Supervisor Jody Noiron.

Rather than suing them id bet an IRS audit would tell you exactly whats going on. 
If this were a smaller company or an actual person taking the water the pipe line would have been shut down already. CORP AMERICA FTL.
The Tragedy of the Commons continues to play itself out in the land of private property.
Man Nestle turned nasty as of late. One can never underestimate human greed, apparently.
Other than forcing the forestry service to issue a permit, what is to be gained by the suit?
I guess we know where all of the water for California's bottled water has been coming from. 
what took so long?
Why hasn't someone monkeywrenched that pipe yet?
Can I say that I just spent the day out and about the San Bernadino Forest and spoke to a local there.  Apparently, at least some locals believe that there's some nasty corruption going on with the USFS out there.

I don't have all the details because I've only just heard about it, but there was something about the Service not spending enough on dead wood clearing and fire control despite local complaints.  Then after fires ripped through the region a few years ago, the USFS collected millions in federal emergency funds.

In light of those rumors, it would make sense that there's been something fishy going on between Nestle and some of these supervisors. Just imagine how many millions Nestle is making off that water - some high level kickbacks in exchange for "overlooking" a permit would be no problem.

I hope this lawsuit can shed some light on the situation.


Nobody in the entire state or federal government give a FLYING FRUCK
Nestle is the new Turing
Effin Swiss bastards - tell them to go back to their little Alpine paradise and consume their water first.
Man the AG industry is really going full force to deflect blame.
Not that I like the guy, but what is different from this and that Bundy nut. Both are using public land without the proper permission. 
Well it's about damn time!
Depends, are you a multi billion dollar corporation? 
I am sure they paid more than that in bribes and fundraisers.
524 a year AND political contributions to the appropriate shills.
>entire forest

The water they took is a pretty meaningless amount.
You can be arrested for collecting rain runoff on your own property. Disgusting times.
> If this were a smaller company or an actual person taking the water

Like when everyone had a collective shitfit about [Tom Selleck's](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/california-drought/tom-selleck-settlement-accepted-california-water-dispute-n392896) water.
Problem is that the land is public. That way nobody really "owns" it except the few people that get voted into local office, and they don't really own it either so their main goal is just to profiteer off it, not develop it.
As of late?

They were never saints
[removed]
I'm only guessing, but renewing the permit may force an automatic environmental impact study or similar procedure.
You can sue to force people to do things.  In this case, presumably, either to force the FS to collect or to stop Nestle's collections.
An environmental review, if it fails no more water.
Not all. Just some.
No. This is just one site it comes from. Think before you post. 
Because then we'd have a bunch of articles and posts about what an idiot that guy was. 
The problem with this theory is how the FS gets it's money. Think of the money being allocated more or less like a grant. So you have different "grants" for fuels reduction, wildfire control, and daily staffing. However, large wildfires are assigned "p" codes, and the money to fight these fires comes from an entirely different pot allocated for emergency management. So if the San Bernadino acquired millions to fight a wildfire those millions can only be used to fight that specific wildfire, not for fuels reduction or prescribed fire. It's a little dumb but hey it's the government. 

On a similar note everyone in the wildland fire community recognizes the need for proactive fire management, but congress has a hard time approving funds for anything other than reactive fire suppression.
The USFS spends most of it's (wholly inadequate) budget on fighting fires and has no money for anything else. And that % going to firefighting keeps going up because idiots keep building in fire-prone areas and then demand their house be saved.

Either cut back on how much property we protect or raise the USFS's budget drastically (and ideally split the firefighting and non-firefighting budgets....better yet make the firefighting a separate agency).

This is why permits are going unexamined for 30 years, they don't have the resources because of the firefighting.
The Feds didn't send the FBI to try and get compliance with Nestle. 
Not even close. Ranchers have been using that land for generations. Nestle isn't merely driving cattle, they're extracting resources.
I definitely would be if I could get that much water for that low price.
They paid more than that for your mother.
Just saying, but the guy you might be thinking of didn't just have something like a barrel, he made what amounted to either a small lake or pond.
I've heard this before. Are these federal laws, or state or county? 
Yeah i've heard about that. Its a joke.
No, but as of late it's downright evil fuckery.
25 million last year

Which was down from 27 million the year before
This isn't true. They pay that fee every year, the permit is simply expired. 
That's correct. The U.S. Forest Service says the permit renewal is to involve a NEPA review process. That process has yet to begin. 
Arrowhead Water
I don't live that far away, how much karma do you think it is worth?
>those millions can only be used to fight that specific wildfire, not for fuels reduction or prescribed fire. It's a little dumb but hey it's the government.

You're right, that's a little dumb.  But I think the problem (that the locals were talking about) was that the emergency funds are somehow skimmed or cleverly misappropriated. For example, you can use the funds to hire more teams (paying the supervisors very well) or buy new equipment to fight that particular fire or just stash some away listing it as "expendable". 

Besides, I think the money came in as "reconstruction" funding after the fact.  I did see **a lot** of shiny, spanking new, service trucks up there the other day. 
That and the bribes
That's the basic line I keep hearing. USFS is underfunded. I'm not disagreeing because I don't know enough to form any hard opinions yet.

However, I can't quite see how underfunding equates to overlooking a major water permit that could potentially bring in millions. Was the administrator so busy with firefighting paperwork that nobody noticed Nestle trucking out huge tanks of water?

Along the same lines, how come the USFS had time to keep checking permits for their expired Adventure Pass program yet somehow overlooked Nestle's huge one?
They got ripped off.
Lol and the temporary embarrassed millionaire magically appears on the thread. 
up to the municipality: you have to have a permit to collect rain wherein the law declares. Water that falls from the sky and onto your property that is, to be clear....
Dihydrogen monoxide is no joke, *sir*

It can:
corrode solid steel, asphyxiate land dwelling animals, destroy winter roads, obliterate small coastal towns, lift and carry full size automobiles, & so much more


look up their policies with Africa and powdered milk
Many years of experience in killing babies. I suppose it isn't as overt as other companies that profit from wars but Nestle has always been perceived as particularly evil because they tricked the mothers into killing their own children.
Wow.  They've paid a whole 14,148 for millions of gallons of water.
Considering that the most likely outcomes involve you getting either shot or arrested, I don't think the karma is worth it.
It's not a major water permit. 25 million gallons isn't that much water and water is not worth much money, even in California.

Nestle pays roughly the same price as an average residential water user per gallon IIRC. Nestle makes millions, because bottled water is sold for a bunch of money, not because their water supply is artificially cheap.

There's no justification for the USFS to *charge* them significantly more than they pay for the source water, it isn't worth that. Even if the permit is reviewed, assuming they continue to allow withdrawal in that quantity, the price will not be likely to go up much.

There's no significant money for USFS in reviewing the permit.
Atlas Shrugged. 
Needs to be banned. 
This, is why my mom wouldn't buy me Quik in '91
Dodgy baby food?
Hundreds of millions of gallons
So I'm thinking a couple thousand karma?
>25 million gallons isn't that much water

This depends an incredible amount on context.  25 mil gallons in the ocean, no big deal.  25 mil gallons from the San Bernadino mountains? That can have a huge impact on wildlife. And that's 25+ mil gallons is *per year*.

People can debate theoretical impact effects, but what I've seen in the mountains is that whenever any company starts pumping out water, streams and watering holes dry up. This kills local wildlife and diversity. The national forests are supposed to be resources - to be harvested when needed - but if a private company is taking stuff from them, they'd sure as hell better have at least a token permit.

And that's thing thing, they've been allowed to draw off water without oversight or review. Maybe you're not from SoCal, but protection of water resources is a very big thing here. It's extremely suspicious that any agency could just "forget" to review it.
Written by the hypocrite who died on social security.
"Investigates?" And yet Nestl√© is still allowed to draw water?

Shut it down and make them refile just like with any citizen. 
>" I have made it a priority to work on this reissuance project,"

Reissuance? It has been expired since 1988, Nestle is still drawing water, there's a severe drought, and the government wants to reissue the permit?

***WTF?!?!***

Throw them in prison, ban them from the state - nay - the *country*, fine them heavily, make sure all the water they've taken can be given out for free in California, and throw away the prison key!!!
So the drought was Nestle the whole time!
I don't believe the US Forest Service did not know the permit had expired. They may of been hog tied trying to enforce the law. But I believe they knew. The table of fairness and protection has been tilted against this great country and her peoples. 
Let's see.  California citizens are in dire need of water.  Nestle has been pilfering water from them for over 25 years.  Let's say Nestle supplies Californians with bottled water free of charge for the next 10 years and call it even.
What happens when we forget to renew our car registration? This would be like me commuting daily in an unregistered Hummer over protected wetlands, and fueling my car with baby Caliifornia Condor blood. Plus, I would get paid billions to do it. 
take these criminals to JAIL- this is the worst drought in CA history-normal people are getting fined hundreds of dollars A DAY for taking too long of a shower and this international corporation gets to capitalize on free water, bottle it up, then sell it back-Judge Judy says 'RIDICULOUS'
What's a 27 year permit lapse between friends?
They need to shut them down while they perform the investigation. 
Light their factory on fire, when there is no water to put it out they can only blame them self
1988?!

I was born that year and I'm 26.  Holy hell
> Nestle, the largest producer of bottled water in the U.S., said it monitors its water use and the environment around the springs where water is drawn.

Yes, it helps predict the next quarter and annual output of the spring.

But thanks for writing this up as if they are concerned about protecting the local environment.
Forest service investigation finds duffel bags of money - concludes Nestle permit is well in order.
"work for our **folks** to work on,"

i hate how our government officials use this word.
Although I hope it's not the case, I'll be it will be renewed like that (snaps fingers).
tax nestle and give citizens free water.
What's to investigate? Either their permit is expired or it isn't. Why the song and dance from law enforcement?
1988??! Wtf? Someone dropped the ball...27 times! 
I hope they make the bastards give it all back.
How hard is it to research this?

No wonder our forests are diminishing
Nineteen-fucking-eighty-eight and they aren't forcing them to halt production immediately?

Pretty damned ridiculous if you ask me.
If any company in the world deserves to be shut down I thinks it's nestle. I think k the ammount of products we would lose for a while would be annoying but seriously it's nothing compared to the slave labor, and the hoarding of fresh water.
The Forest Service is not investigating anything. They are scrambling to cover their asses and ensure Nestles' business is not interrupted.
Nestle. Water from tap cost pennies. Water in a bottle cost dollars. The FDA doesn't regulate bottled water either. 
> The U.S. Forest Service is investigating an expired permit that Nestle has been using to draw water out of a national forest in Southern California for its bottled water business [..] The process of renewing the permit requires an environmental review, which can take **between 18 months to more than two years to complete**.

the California drought isn't *that* urgent^for ^multinationals

if you are a resident, you better damned not take two showers or you'll get fined ASAP
My thoughts exactly. 
Good luck ousting the nestle machine

[deleted]
Nestle is part of it, but Ag is a much bigger part. 
If you're going to blame Nestle, you need to blame Blue Diamond or the California Nut Growers Association as well.  Almonds are a huge part of the cause of the California drought.  And I'm part of the problem.  I swear those almonds are like crack.
The drought is a climate issue.  Even without a drought, there's too much water usage in California.  
They knew.  A contingent of local expert biologists have been writing to the Forest Service for awhile about this particular diversion.  It affects a creek up in the mountains with endangered species.
Nah it's fair. If my driver's license is expired and I get pulled over they would let me keep driving until I can find time to be reissued a new one.
Or stop bottling water all together. It's wasteful, exploitative and it pollutes the fuck out of our planet. 
Let's see if we can get away without renewing our license and not paying taxes for 27 years.

Corporations are people my friends.
To be fair Nestle didn't cause the drought, and that water is still flowing regardless.  However, Nestle plans to take full advantage of the drought by selling record amounts of bottled water at elevated prices then justify the gouging by calling it supply and demand.  
I say Y'all in official emails. 
It's been pretty common at every big company I've ever worked at.
Folks is commonly used when you dont want to single out the word guys or girls.

Besides, folks is a normal word. Its not like they wrote some slang or some shit.
It makes you question the purpose of issuing permits if a company can go this long without a valid permit and then essentially automatically renew said expired permit.
Oh they're giving it back alright ...all over our feet and legs and faces
Except their permit expired in 1988.  They've had 27 years to renew.  Fuck them.  Shut it down.  And don't renew until 27 years of back payments are made.
Well hes more making a statement about what would happen to a private citizen in this situation.
People like you who want to be soft on shit like this is why these corporations can get away with whatever they want. 
I wouldn't be surprised if there are many other examples like this though. If the California state government would actually start reviewing permits and investigating usage they might make a dent in wastage.
> Ag is a much bigger part. 

We could do our part by avoiding almonds
Nestle is taking the water illegally and not paying for it while making huge profits. Wether or not this is THE probled, it doesnt change that its a huge problem.
I agree.  It's been a gimmick every since it started.  
There are good reasons to bottle some water commercially. Clean bottled water saves lives during emergencies, and government emergency response can't match the distribution speed and efficiency of grocery stores.
People need to stop buying that shit.
Please give a source which states the Nestle is gouging citizens of California with elevated prices for bottled water.
It is a way for big companies to seem more human and family like
You mean when people shower?
27 years of payments? 14.75 should handle that....
[deleted]
maybe, but this is a national forest, and California has no jurisdiction there.

I do agree with the point though, investigate permits within their jurisdiction and shut down "illegal" draws.
Agreed. Just read another article about the Delta being drained, water disappearing. Almond farmers with senior water rights are not facing restrictions and have direct pipelines into the delta. Saltwater is now flowing into the Delta region because the freshwater is disappearing. This is going to be an environmental disaster. At this point, let's just cut off almond growing. Pay the goddamn farmers if we have to. Until then...everyone....just don't buy any almonds. 
Oh, I am by no means arguing that Nestle isn't the devil - they definitely are up to no good and should not be taking California water and bottling it.  But they are not the only devil here, or even the biggest one.  

The true villains are the beurocrats who have allowed this situation to be legal in the first place.  And maybe growing shit in a desert isn't the greatest idea ever, except the land was super cheap back in the day and water scarcity was not always an issue.  The population of California has grown exponentially since the farming business started -- this is not a problem that sprung up overnight.  And yes, climate change is another major factor working against the area.  This problem has been many years in the making.  But almond trees require huge amounts of water and the demand for almonds (and almond products,  like almond milk) has also gown considerably.  We need to find more appropriate places to grow them, and other crops that need not be exclusive to California, like citrus.   We need to let deserts be deserts.

But that's not going to happen as long as there are financial incentives to continue agriculture in California. 
>However, Nestle *plans* to take full advantage  

I guess this is a wait and see I told you so.


Oh yes...shower indeed
Your car registration is only $50 but you don't get to drive without it.  It's not the money.  It's the principal.
I think you need to investigate the [balance fallacy](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy). 
Yeah, its just a foot in the right direction. Its a shame it takes something so dramatic to happen to get people to do their jobs.
So how do you handle shutting down one if the few industries in such an economically depressed regions in the USA?
It would be very highly unlikely that Nestle woud gouge, considering it's very illegal and the fact they millions of people would be watching them do it.

So you just decided to type some BS about what you think Nestle would do but you have nothing to back it up?

Nice...
I wish my registration was only $50
But big gubberment and our rights and what not.
[deleted]
Continuing an industry that does not have long term sustainability for the sake of local economy is the nice thing to do, but not necessarily the right one.  It's rapidly coming to point where something has to give.  

I feel for people in that situation.   I grew up in the early 80s in the rust belt.  I know what it's like to *constantly* worry about your parents getting laid off.  I'm not trying to be insensitive -- just realistic.

You can't get blood from a stone, or in this case, water.  Either there needs to be great strides made in desalination or the ag business in California is going to have to be scaled down. Decreasing the population of California would probably also help, but I don't see a good way of accomplishing that, short of discouraging people from moving there (and honestly, if drought, earthquakes, wild fires, mud slides, and expensive housing isn't enough to discourage people from moving there, it beats the hell out of me what would).

And while I don't live in California, I have good friends who do.  It's something that troubles me a lot.
While you are spending some time online, check out [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) in addition.
How about no lead in the food Nestle...
Why is this being worded as Nestle doing something wrong.

Sure it shouldn't have happened in the first place, but the cost absorbed by Nestle.

I love this line: "The instant noodles arrived in India in 1983 and can be found in corner shops across the country." 
How the hell does a higher than acceptable level of *lead* even happen? Do they sprinkle noodles with lead or something?
TBF - The Indian government has claimed they tested packets and found higher than legal levels of lead. But have not released the test results, details of which packets failed, how those packets were tested, and there's some question as to whether the recall is even legally mandated.

I'm no friend of monstrous corporate interests, but the Indian Government's claims are downright shady. 
With Nestle's reputation and history, I'm afraid they'd just dump their inventory in third world countries.
>Earlier this month, Nestle began withdrawing the Maggi brand from stores, after regulators said they found higher-than-allowed levels of lead in some packets.

Who wants lead in there Magi?
"Nestle has 80% of India's instant noodles market."

lol, how the fuck does this happen?
That's why you should never miss a bribe payment.
They are not worth $50M.  If they are toxic they are worthless. 
Oh they got caught big time this time around.
Noodlesworth is the name of my salamander. :(
"Food" with lead in it isn't worth $50M.  It's a liability, not an asset.  
Are the noodles really worth $50m if they have heavy metal contamination?
Even though they may have to dump the food, they should give the packages to the poor rather than just wasting them by tossing in the dump. Better to have slightly elevated lead contamination than to die from starvation.
"The instant noodles arrived in India in 1983 and can be found in corner shops across the country." Never mind the lead, those noodles are way past their expiration date!
[removed]
So if the lead amounts were higher then allowed, what is allowed?  I would hope the answer is none but somehow I don't think suspect it.
you know food with lead in it isnt worth anything fucking geniuses.
I've wrecked at least that many noodles.  Don't see anyone writing stories about me.
"None" is virtually impossible.
They put too much lead in their flavor packets
[deleted]
Could have leached into the process water from lead pipes, could have been present in the crops used for production. I'm guess water is driven off during manufacturing, leaving lead and other contaminants present in the product.
They are not required to release the report, just the results. You could file an RTI query to gather those reports if you wish. It's nowhere near being 'downright shady'.
It's sad, but a reasonable reaction. When a country known for being horrendously corrupt does what looks like "the right thing", well no, it's probably just corruption.

The failure to disclose the lab results is telling.
Did you read the article? It‚Äôs a third world country that‚Äôs forcing them to remove their stock. I highly doubt they‚Äôd just try to shift it to other third world countries, if only because of shipping costs. It will likely be destroyed. 
The same people who value them at $50m?
How the hell does lead get into noodles anyway?
[deleted]
read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning
That's probably a poorly written sentence, not old noodles.
>  I would hope the answer is none 

Unfortunately, that's not how food production works. There are a few zero tolerance things, but lead, and even arsenic and rat hair are not among those things. It's nice to think that we could easily keep bad stuff like that out of our food, but with variations in soil and the fact that factories are not hermetically sealed, we have to deal with reality. That being said, the allowable amount of lead is very, very small -  enough that your kidneys should be able to flush it out
You can't get "none", if I read the [CDC page](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=7&po=8) right, it's 0.5 ¬µg/mL
You wouldn't have any food if the limit to anything like that was none.  
ELI5 please! I would appreciate it!
To me "Nestle to destroy noodles worth $50m" reads like "Nestle to waste $50m worth of food" implied: [for no reason, because they are evil bastards]

A better title would have been something like "Nestle recalls Maggi noodle products in asian markets for unacceptable lead levels"

Remains of leaded gasoline still in the soil all around the world.

It's similar to how there are bits and pieces of radioactive material everywhere from Nuclear weapon testing (and more so Coal power plants). Shit gets everywhere. 
Food safety, god.
But if the acceptable lead levels were HIGHER than the maximum amount allowed, the individual packs should have been picked up in the metal detector at retail.

We had a similar problem in our work years back, every single pack kept getting rejected and we had no idea why, damaged pipe infected every product. Was caught before sent to customer.
It should be automatic.  If lab results show positive indication of higher than acceptable levels of lead, there is no reason whatsoever to keep the methodology and the data secret.

There is only one reason to conceal those things, and it has nothing to do with the law or bureaucratic "requirements".  You conceal the methodology and data so that nobody can take issue with them.  If you have a problem with people taking issue with your methodology and data, then it's extremely unlikely the methodology and data are sound.

As they say, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
Of course the lab results were disclosed. How else do you think Nestle alleged a flaw in the methodology? Don't be that average redditor who goes off his feels rather than the facts.
It's India, yes.   I am from the Philippines and Nestle has been known to dump bad inventories and I feel they'll just do their usual shell game. 
Depends how high the lead levels are. The allowable levels are usually very low, so it could still be trace contamination and not meet standard. Plenty of piping, trucking, and equipment come into play in the process of making the various raw ingredients and packaging everything.
Yep.  They need to think about the cost of their lack of quality control more than the "value" of this "food".
I know what lead poisoning is. These might have a slightly higher than accepted lead content but that doesn't mean they are poisonous for consumption.
Thanks for the info.  My knowledge in food production is zero.
It's dL, not mL. there are 100 mLs in a dL
And even if you could get none, you can't verify none by testing.
[deleted]
There are always trace amounts of horrible things in food... Lead, rat feces, etc. from microscopic particles that float around in the air.  These will inevitably come into contact with the food during manufacturing so instead of saying zero, they get a very small threshold... Something like 5 grams of lead for every million grams of food (5 parts per million).

Same thing with lead, arsenic, etc. in drinking water.  You'll always have at least some contamination, the question becomes how much is safe and reasonable.
How would you propose determining if there isn't a single atom of lead in any macroscopic amount of any matter?
I give you an 'F' in sensational journalism.

Way to tell a factually accurate story in one sentence and kill our page view ad revenue stream.
I don't think the maximum amount of lead allowed in food is enough to trip a metal detector. I mean some foods are fortified with iron at levels that would be toxic if the iron was lead yet those foods make it through metal detectors without rejection.
A metal detector would see pieces of metallic lead. I am sure that is not what this is about. 
> As they say, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

Surely you can see the problem with this mode of thinking?

Don't you think the first thing Nestle would have done is filed the RTI and got their hands on the entirety of the test result and methodology? In fact they've already commented on what they allege is a flaw with the methodology.

There are a lot of things governments do not directly and voluntarily place in an openly accessible domain. As long as there exists an easy means for interested parties to access that information, allegations of shadiness need to be held off. Reddit loves stating general principles without bothering to delve into the ground reality.
> As they say, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

Ah yes, reddit's favorite catch phrase when they stand to benefit from it, but hate when cops say it to them.
Can a trace amount of lead be lethal?

I'm not finding much that says that lead poisoning is better than dying of starvation.
How is that possible? And why is there a 'limit' on how much lead can be present in a food product?
Thank you for using the accent over the √©. 
Thanks for your reply, it helped a lot. 
"Nestle sells lead-laced noodles then destroys the evidence."
I'm fairly sure a magnetometer doesn't pick up lead that well to begin with. You usually look for it with XRF, but I'm not sure that's going to catch levels you would see in food.
Amounts of lead that are generally not dangerous to adults can be very dangerous to children.
The concern isn't that you're going to drop dead face down in your bowl of noodles. It's long term nervous system damage over years of consumption. Although whether the lead will kill you before the salt does is questionable.
If all you ate was those noodles for every meal for a year straight, maybe.   Since the government won't release full details about testing methods, this whole fiasco is obviously an attempt by a competitor to gain market share.
And I'm not seeing anywhere that says how high "far higher" is quantifying. There are levels that could be higher than you would want to sustain for a long period of time and there are levels that are straight up poisonous. If it's higher than recommended but not poisonous, not starving (which they do have a problem with in India) is a better alternative.

Here is an on point WAPO article on the issue:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/02/11/lead-and-cadmium-in-chocolate-noooooooooooo/

From what I understand, people still debate where the elevated lead deposits in chocolate are coming from. I've seen it blamed on being grown in soils that have particularly high levels of lead, on the coast of Africa. I've also seen it blamed, as in this article, on some step in the manufacturing process.

What scientists seem to be agreeing about, in any case, is that lead levels in chocolate are too damn high.
Have you never heard of lead poisoning?
its like this with everything on lots of stuff

limits on bugs and such, contamination in general

really small amounts are fine but if it breaches a small limit they gotta remake it because its too contaminated

Like you make bread at your house theres some dirt, tiny crumbs, and some other things that were just on whatever you put the dough on but a little bit is fine, when theres more it becomes an issue
"Nestle sells noodles with THIS chemical.  You won't believe what they do next!"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning

> No safe threshold for lead exposure has been discovered‚Äîthat is, there is no known sufficiently small amount of lead that will not cause harm to the body.



I forget where and I never researched it, but there was a statement  that the amount of lead in our bones/bodies compared to remains of those pre-leaded gasoline era is obscene, like 300x. 

And they didn't understand how our bodies processed lead, so they made test subjects breathe lead heavy air. When their urine didn't have lead, the deemed it safe. It wasn't until later that they figured out that lead doesn't get passed through urine, and sticks around in the body. 

It might have been a very one sided article, but the level of global impact for using leaded gasoline was quite high, as well as the corporate push to make it happen. 
Students hate them!
Yet there is an acceptable amount allowed in all food manufacturing. It is impossible to eliminate all exposure to lead. Pretending that a small amount of lead exposure will kill someone faster than starvation and is a better alternative is just idiocy.
[Huh. I don't know if 300x is true or not, but this does imply that we aren't being exposed to more than before, but that the preset safe level of exposure has been narrowed to a much lower number, increasing the statistical exposure.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lead-exposure-on-the-rise/)
Yep. It's .1ppm for candy. I'm not sure about other types of food.

http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm172050.htm
I'm suggesting there are worse things than death.  And that medically there is no known safe amount, so your argument that it "may be safe" isn't really one you can make.
No, now you're just being ridiculous. Humanity was exposed to lead for eons before they knew it caused issues and even still used it after they suspected it. Hell, the Romans used it to sweeten their wine. Nobody is saying that lead in the diet is a good thing, but if you think a slow death from starvation and malnutrition is a better alternative then frankly you're an idiot. 
If you're going to die of starvation, a one-time drop of some leadened noodles isn't going to change your long term outlook.    
>The U.S. Forest Service on Friday proposed giving Nestle a five-year permit to keep siphoning millions of gallons of water from the Southern California mountains to bottle and sell.

Oh, yay, US Forest Service. Good for you.  You're "proposing" giving a permit for something Nestle is already doing, apparently without supervision, and in the meantime you'll just let them keep on doing it. And there's also no mention of the terms of this glorious permit or if anything will change at all.

<cough>*corrupt-as-shit*<cough>
"The U.S. Forest Service on Friday proposed giving Nestle a five-year permit to keep siphoning millions of gallons of water from the Southern California mountains to bottle and sell."
So on the one hand Nestle gets it's water for free while on the other it's CEO advocates that it isn't a human right. So water is a corporate right to be resold to the very people it was taken from.  
I was just wondering how that billing of $500 for 25,000,000 gallons of water compares to my Southern California water bill.  My utility charges by 1000 gallon units, anywhere from $4.62 to $10.26 per unit, depending on usage.

25,000,000 gallons / 25,000 = 1000 gives us the divisor of 25,000 or "how many units".  

Nestle is billed $500 per year for 25,000 units of water.

$500/25,000 = $0.02 per unit.

Cripes.  I'm getting ripped off big time for water, and so is every other customer of our water untility district, at least compared to the deal the Federal Government gives to Nestle!

I'd love to purchase my water at $0.02 per 1000 gallons.  To what Federal agencies should citizens apply for such a low-cost water supply?

I mean, we're all equals under the law, yes?
I would like to see California bottle this water and sell it instead of Nestle. 
Imagine how may Californians can be employed and how much tax revenues would be raised.
Cliven Bundy does this with cattle and everyone is in an uproar. Nestle just has to pay $500?
[deleted]
It takes as much as three times more water to make one plastic water bottle than to fill it. That completely leaves out the water needed to pump, bottle, crate and ship the final product. So much for their deceptive statement:
>The Arrowhead water "has been sustainably sourced from the Arrowhead Springs for more than 121 years, and NWNA remains dedicated to environmental stewardship in order to provide healthy hydration to consumers," the statement said.

Only good thing about nestle, is you could do whatever you want to them, and not feel bad about it.
T.I.L. Hitler survived, and is running Nestle.
And then even while paying nothing for it, they continued pumping water with an expired permit for decades 
Unless Nestle wants to directly truck & donate that water to Flint, the feds need to get them off of the forest. 
Damn Swiss always taking our water! Go back to Swissland you!
No your not. You can't do simple math. 28 million gallons of water do not fall on 2 acres in that area. Lol.
Let's hope the permit is approved because this whole thing was just blown out of proportion by morons. The only issue is lack of collection of dues
https://cara.ecosystem-management.org/Public//CommentInput?Project=48530

They are accepting public comments.  EVERYONE should take the time to comment.
You will give us the water unless you want us to stop holding back the seahorses. And I don't think NorCal wants the seahorses. I don't think NorCal wants the seahorses at all.

The Swiss are some of the sneakiest weasels on the planet.  Hitler could have learned some lessons from them.
Would be beyond ironic if California became water source for Michigan.
Do you live in California?? Do you even know what the fuck is going on here???
Dues or payment? They pay for the water, right?
What national forest is that on?  Do you know? 
Yes I do. I also know how much 5 million gallons of water is
No,  they're not paying for the water.  They're basically paying 500 bucks a year to put their pipes & infrastructure on public land. Outfickingrageous.
Morons all over this thread. They **do** pay for the water, the Forrest service did not bill them the permit fees for years. Morons here think that the water being drawn by this plant is Significant..... It isn't by a long shot
San Bernardino National Forest
Yeah you don't because it's 28 million gallons of water a year. Obviously you don't live in California 
What do you mean by "significant"?

Do they pay for water by volume like other companies and individuals, or do they pay just dues?
I do. 28 million ain't shit
they pay industrial rates that are standardized
In California, it's a lot so I'm thinking you have trouble with the truth. Nestle paid $500 a year to take 28 million gallons of water, bottle it and sell it. The forestry official in charge of that then went to work for Nestle. 
Even with paying so little, they pumped water for decades with an expired permit.
Thanks for the clarification. I would look it up but I do not feel like going through public records and it's not my state.
Do you know what the industrial rate is for water? 
25 million gallons won't fill 4 olympic sized swimming pools. Its also about the rainfall collected on 2.3 acres in the San Bernadino Mountains - about the size of a parking lot.
 

which I said in my top level comment was the issue
Apparently you don't have a clue about what you are talking about. According to USGS, a swimming pool holding just a million gallons of water would have to be as long as a football field, 50 feet wide and 10 feet deep. I love how certain redditors will simply make shit up to make a point.
FYI it only takes 27 thousand gallons of water to cover 1acre at 1" of rain. Since that area only gets 22" of rain a year, it seems your math is just a little off.
Olympic swimming pools are 2m by 25m by 50m, or 2500 m^3 or 660,430 gallons. Times 4 gives 2,641,720. You're right. I'm off by a factor of 10. That would make it "wouldn't fill 40" pools. Still right about the parking lot, though.
I was  under the impression that [the area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino_Mountains#Geography_and_climate) received 40" pa. But you're right. I was off by a factor of 10. It would take a 25 acre parking lot.

Sucking up California's water, slave labor and glass, boy Nestle sure is a great company
... Great... I got stouffers lasagna in my freezer. Damn it.
I've said it before and I'll say it again as I have documented proof.  Nestle is actually trying to hurt folks.  I assayed their NIDO powder and found it had toxic levels of iron and arsenic. It's impossible it was from the cows--at least not the iron, arsenic perhaps. It was sourced from cows from mexico which could have been grazing next to a landfill with electronics leachates.  The amount of iron would have killed the cows.
How do you recall food, like what the fuck.

Ah Nestle, still topping the list for evil giant corporations. 
>Nestle is being sued in the United States for allegedly knowingly allowing its Fancy Feast cat food to contain fish from a Thai supplier that uses slave labor.

That cleared things up.  I was wondering what the fuck slave fish were for a moment
Wow.  It's illegal to import goods produced by salve labour into the US (and many other countries), so if the charges are proven this could get it banned completely.
Read up on nestle, even for a corporation they're fucking rotten.
This just in: Nestle is still anti-human rights. 
I wish there was more we could do, as a consumer I already boycott their products but I wish we could just get old school and gather some pitchforks and dive in head first. 
Given that it's nestle, I am quite happy they're having the slaves catch fish, instead of just using the slaves as cat food.
It's almost like Nestle is evil not by convenience, but for its own sake.
I didn't know there was real fish in Fancy Feast. 
I work in seafood, and most farm raised shrimp comes from Indonesia, Thailand, and India.  I think there's a lawsuit going on in California right now about people buying slave caught shrimp.  I always figured it was pretty obvious that this was, if not slave labor, damn near close to it.  My point, I guess, is why is everyone acting so surprised?
Nestle's name is taking a beating this year.
My cats will be pleased to know this.
gasp! Nestle? but they're such an ethical company... we need boycott these fuckers
Nestles been using slaves for years. People have ran out of shits to give. 
Non-issue. To cats we're all slaves.
Related NSFW NYT article and vid:http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/middleeast/murder-at-sea-captured-on-video-but-killers-go-free.html?_r=0

There are other articles linking Asian/Indian subcontinent/African/Arab sailors to such behavior. The only reason these people survive is someone is buying their fish.
Wasting fish for cat food. Outrageous. 
So instead of being upset at Thailand for allowing slave labor we are upset at Nestle for seeing an opportunity to keep costs down. 
I don't think cat owners would care.
I should file a lawsuit accusing Nestle of raping children, just to see how the headlines pan out. 
All fish are created equal!
[Slave Fish](http://ohsnapbacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slave-bass-destruction-snapback-cap-3-close.jpg) are common in the States... You just gotta find them listening to crazy music while cruising on skateboards.
I was thinking whips for fish, but then had to wonder if they had a special one for them - something hydrodynamic.
Ahhh okay. I was wondering how I could make a fish my slave O.o
Not being a retard would clear a lot of stuff up too. The title makes pretty damn obvious.
The U.S. imports goods touched and produced by slaves quite freely and willingly.

Most of the world's chocolate comes from the Ivory Coast, where child slavery is still a thing. If you're buying chocolate, there's a chance it's been touched by a child slave.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_cocoa_production#Child_slavery_and_trafficking
I try to boycott their products, but at least once a month, I find out I accidentally bought some brand under their umbrella. God, I hate Nestl√©... 
They should stay away from anything having to do with water for sure.
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage.
For the most part, the fish used in cat food is not fit for human consumption. 
Yes, we should be upset at Nestle.  As a procurement manager for a large company (not Nestle large, but big enough), it's my responsibility to make sure human rights aren't being neglected in ANY vendor I choose.  With corporations, you are spending significantly more than any one person can.  If I spend with a company that violates human rights, I'm paying to have more rights violated.  If I were to need more shrimp, say in this case, and tell the company my forecast is up 5% - well, that's another slave caught for purposes of my needs.  

It is not exactly difficult to make sure companies are on the up on and up either.  I see comments about Nestle and McDonalds, how were they to know!? Well...  I go on a plant visit before bringing someone on - do their employees look healthy, happy, working at their own violation?  Is the environment safe? Are they regulated by OSHA or EPA or another governing body that has put their stamp of approval? 

Not that difficult. 
 Ones a corporation one is a company. What would you recommend, bombing Thailand?
I have a couple of cats and I care. However, I'm pretty sure cats would enslave the entire human race if given enough time.

This will be buried and I understand r/news isn't always the best place to be objective, but putting my partisan bias aside,  I had the opportunity to chat with one of the experts on this situation a couple weeks ago about this, and learned some interesting stuff. I don't want to put any spin on this, so I'm only repeating my understanding of what I was told.

* There is a total of \~20,000,000 gallons of water per minute \(GPM\), permitted to be extracted within the State of Michigan. Nestle will be increasing their extraction in one well from 250 GPM to 400 GPM, bringing their statewide extraction rate to about 2,175 GPM.
* Nestle is approximately the 450th largest user of water in the state, slightly behind Coca\-Cola.
* Nestle won't pay for the water, because water is, by statute, not a commodity to be bought and sold within the State of Michigan, or any of the states and provinces within the Great Lakes Compact. Since it is not a commodity, it is a resource. This protects us from California or Arizona from building massive pipelines to buy our water as our natural resource laws prevent this. Residents also don't pay for water, rather we pay for treatment, infrastructure, and delivery of water, but the water itself is without cost.
* The state denies lots of permit requests, but this request showed sufficient evidence that it would not harm the state's natural resources, so state law required it to be approved. The state law which requires this to be approved can be changed, but due to the resource vs. commodity thing that's probably not something we want.

So... there's some perspective on the matter. It was approved because the laws and regulations require it to be approved if the states wants to continue treating water as a natural resource and not a commodity.

***Edit:*** *Well, it turns out this wasn't buried. Thanks reddit, for being objective and looking at both sides before writing me off as horrible for offering another perspective. Also, huge thanks to the anonymous redditors for the gold.* 

*A couple things: No, I'm not a corporate shill or a Nestle employee. Generally I lean left in my politics, but my background is in the environmental world, so I'm trying to be objective here. You're welcome to stalk my reddit history. You'll find I'm a pretty boring dude who has used the same account for 4 years. I apologize that I've not offered sources, but like I said \- this was based on a discussion with an expert who I'm sure would prefer to remain anonymous. That being said, I fully invite you to fact check me and call me out if I'm wrong. I like to be shown I'm wrong, because I can be less wrong in the future. And once again, I sincerely apologize for assuming people wouldn't want to read this. You all proved me wrong!*
200,000 gal is nothing though...[It is less than a third of an olympic swimming pool.](https://www.livestrong.com/article/350103-measurements-for-an-olympic-size-swimming-pool/) 

A typical estuary flows for about that amount in a half a second. An inch of rain over an area of ten acres is about the same amount.

I believe you mean "Snyder first admitted the problem two years ago."
Such a horrible practice. Nestle buys a permit for next to nothing and makes millions off of bottled water sales all while depleting the water tables in the surrounding community. No doubt the politicians that approved this are getting something out of it.
[deleted]
I'll keep saying it. Stop buying bottled water. It's a scam.
"Shitty headline causes outrage over something that's actually fucking nothing."

Accuweather? Really? The site owned by a global warming denier? First of all, when the fuck did they become a source of news about anything other than the weather, and second of all, shitty source is shitty. 
[removed]
200,000 gallons doesn't seem like much. I work at a Water Treatment Plant that pumps 20-40 million gallons a day. When we wash one of the filters, we use almost 200,000 gallons! We do two or three filter washes a day.
Sounds like 80,000 people could just get together and apply for a $250 permit to pump ground water themselves.
[deleted]
Does anybody mad about this have any idea how much water is in Michigan? Like, ANY idea? 
Yet another reason why I don't purchase items from Nestle or any of their subsidiaries like Purina or Haagen-Dazs.
Just to put things in perspective, a 60 gpm well can irrigate 10 acres of alfalfa in eastern WA.

That‚Äôs 86400 gallons a day.

All they took is a water budget of a small hay farm.
Okay so can someone explain the problem to me?

What I would use to asses the situation is

1. overall water usage in the region

2. Nestles water usage in the region (thus Nestles increase in water usage in the region)

3. a study that analysis how much of the water can be used in the mid to long term (or as long as the permit is for/can be replaced) wihtout depleting water levels in the region

So if what's on the Nestle website was true, and the amount of water used was minimal (or well under 0.1%) and the USGS said it was replenishable by nature, then what is the problem with this permit?

Is it that politicians give out a permit without first addressing the old pipes? Can't these two problems be treated seperately?
get over yourselves, that's not much water compared to other industries water consumption.  
Can someone tell me why this is a bad thing? All I see is a bunch of outraged people talking mainly about Flint. I'm not seeing any connection, at least from the article, other than they both involve h2o.
Has anyone actually asked themselves if 200k gallons is a lot of water? I work in the dairy industry and pretty much every factory uses more than 200k gallons a day. I'm not talking big factories either. Medium factories use around 300-400k daily while the real big factories use >1000k gallons a day.

Maybe the US has much less water reserves then where I am from. Really curious.
I know this will get buried, but anyone who is outraged about this is a moron. you don't understand how the administrative process works, you don't understand who legislatures work, and you know nothing about Michigan.

If at any point Michigan runs low on fresh water, the whole planet is completely fucked.  The great lakes as well as any other bodies of water, are the largest fucking fresh water source on the planet.  If you don't like the idea of someone bottling water and making a profit off it, fine don't drink bottled water.  If you are outraged because of Flint, this has absolutely fuckall to do with Flint. Flint needs new pipes. Flint is insolvent and can't afford it.  Either the state or the federal government needs to step in.  At this point, I don't know the details of why that hasn't happened, but that seems outrageous to me.  
Out of curiosity, where do people think consumed water goes after we piss and shit it out? Do people really think it magically evaporates and it‚Äôs gone forever? 
Anyone else think it's weird the link is accuweather?
Holy fucking shit!  200,000 gallons per day?  That‚Äôs not really that much water. Most decently sized plants will do 10x that in a day.

ELI5: Why is this a big deal? 

I mean, I think bottled water is bad for the environment.. but besides that.
People, we are doing this to ourselves.

There is nothing wrong with your tap water. The water Nestle pulls out of your local water table is the EXACT SAME WATER that they put in the bottle. The tap water is actually SAFER. The bottled water sits in a warehouse, in a truck, in the heat, in that plastic bottle for God knows how long before you drink it. If there was a smidge of bacteria in there (and there probably was), it has probably grown / multiplied in the bottle in the water, in the heat, etc. You are already paying for your municipal water. Why would you pay for water in a bottle when it is already coming out of your taps for a fraction of the price? Then on top of that, look at all the plastic waste. It is just STUPID all around.

We, the people can stop this. Just stop buying bottled water! Yes, there are circumstances where bottled water can make sense (contaminated water supplies, remote areas with no access to clean water, etc). But for 99% of the North American population, buying bottled water is really, really dumb. And people will say... well... it is convenient. How hard is it to fill a refillable bottle of water at home before you leave or refill it on the go? The real truth is that people are LAZY. They are willing to pay that $2.00 or more for that bottle of water so they don't have to think about it... just grab it and when you are done... toss the plastic bottle. Easy right? Except for all that plastic waste.

Shit... I take my dog for a walk almost every day at noon in the woods. For a whole year, I picked up trash. I walked the same rout every day and every day I filled a full size garbage bag FULL of trash. 90% of that was empty, discarded, plastic water bottles. The areas along the river that I walk... not uncommon to see a dozen discarded plastic water bottles on the shore or floating along in the river.

I absolutely HATE bottled water and what it has done to us. I really wish people would wake up and abandon this ridiculousness.
What grounds do they oppose it on??

Just general outrage about something they are confused about? 
The Great lakes region is finding a way to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory and piss away the worlds largest sources of freshwater. First Foxconn now this why am I not surprised .
 Edit: Jaws not jobs 
I know this sounds like a lot, but it's really not. Many states use tens of *billions* of gallons of water per day. Most of it for agriculture & power.  
Outrage over essentially nothing. 200,000 gallons of water is for all intents and purposes not a significant amount of water.

Shasta Dam, in the very dry state of California, holds 4,552,000 acre feet of water, or 1.48x10^12 gallons of water. It would take nestle 20,318 years to empty Shasta Dam once at the rate of 200,000 gallons per day.

I don't think people realize that bottling water is a tiny component of water use(and I definitely wouldn't call it waste as it is consumed by humans).

Edit: Just in case anyone wants to bring up flint. Flint's issue is their pipes are old and made of lead, not a lack of water. In that very article linked the Michigan legislature is putting forth a bill to fund the replacement of this outdated and dangerous infrastructure. Flint and drawing water from an aquifer are quite literally different objects that have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Now if Michigan was having a serious drought then that would be a different story, but even then 200,000 gallons per day is insignificant. 
If only Michigan was bordered by three of the biggest freshwater lakes in the world, was underlain by thick aquifers composed of glacial till, and received ample rainfall on a yearly basis.

But seriously, why has Reddit decided to hop on the circlejerk hate train for Nestle?  Has coca cola hired some Russian bots or something? 
Environmental Consultant here:

There‚Äôs a a lot of confusion and knee-jerk reactionism going on here. This increase in their withdrawal in no way, shape or form affects Flint‚Äôs access to water. Flint‚Äôs problems are a result of old pipes. Anyone with the resources can submit a permit to the regulatory agency and drill a well once approved. The limiting factor is NOT the amount of water. It‚Äôs flint‚Äôs shitty pipes and from what I‚Äôve read the drinking water is back within federal standards there too.
Is everyone complaining about the fact that they're taking the water or are they complaining just because it's nestle?

Lake Michigan has 6 quadrillion gallons of water in it. Even at 200,000 gallons per day. How much of an impact do you think nestle will even make on that lake in 50 years?
200k gallons of water is nothing lmao. That's a cube of water with sides of 30 ft. People freaking out over nothing
[deleted]
200,000 gallons a day is nothing. 

Quick math: 

Want 200,000 gallons consumed every DAY? Then all 9M people in Michigan would have to consume just under 2/3 of a gallon A MONTH.

200,000 gal a day X 31 days = 6,200,000 gal a month. 
Population of Michigan  = 9,900,000
Maybe people should stop pissing away their money on bottled water. Like, it's not that good, it's overpriced, it generates a ton of plastic waste, and you're doing shit like this.
Let's just agree to stop buying bottled water already. I get it, sometimes it's totally necessary but those situations are very rare. Slow the demand, slow the supply. 
In college I worked for the water authority for the largest county in a southern state where we pumped 21 million gallons A DAY from 5 reserviors to the county. What's the big deal here?
Michigan has no shortage of water whatsoever; they have massive aquifers and are located on one of the largest sources of freshwater in the world. 

Letting Nestle bottle water is essentially risk free and makes the 
state basically free (limited admittedly) money
[removed]
They can bottle it and sell in to Flint
200k? Foxconn says hold my beer...
ITT: people pretending they are conservationalists when they likely just drink bottled water like most people.


Everyone is outraged at everything. The smart people do not give 2 shits about stupid shit like this.
Most people don't seem to understand how small an amount of water Nestle asked to use.

They asked for an increase from 250 gallons per minute to 400 gallons per minute. For reference, a typical lawn sprinkler system uses 20 gallons per minute. So their total water usage is equivalent to 20 houses watering their lawn. Accounting for the fact sprinkler systems aren't on 24/7, maybe it's equivalent to 500 houses. Still a trivially small amount.

And most of that water Nestle bottles will be consumed in the Great Lakes watershed, and returned to the watershed.

Guess how much water leaves Michigan via the Detroit River every minute. 90,000,000 gallons. Every minute. And the concern is over Nestle bottling 400 gallons per minute? Does that seem rational?

What about evaporation? On peak days in late fall or early winter, with a high delta between air and water temps, low relative humidity and high wind speeds, the Great Lakes can lose 0.5 inches of water per day. This equates to 570,000,000 gallons per *minute*.  To equal the amount that evaporates per *minute*, Nestle woudld have to run at peak production, 24/7, for almost *1000 days*.[](http://glisa.umich.edu/media/files/projectreports/GLISA_ProjRep_Lake_Evaporation.pdf)

Again, we're supposed to be worried about Nestle's 400 gallons per minute? Seems really silly compared to the loss due to natural causes and the fact that a good amount of the Nestle water will be "recycled".
This comment section is exactly the reason that direct democracy would be a terrible idea. Both Nestle and the state followed law exactly as written, the water crisis in Flint has nothing to do with water availability its about water transportation infrastructure, and this is a negligible amount of water anyways. This headline is enough to whip people into an emotional frenzy with no basis in fact.
Hahaha wait till foxconn's 7 million gallons of water per day draw hits reddit. 
Environmental engineer here.  

Nestle prepared and submitted an appropriate impact analyses outlining the potential environmental impact of the installation which was reviewed and found to meet the guidelines for approval.  Additionally,  nestle had to commit to appropriately abandoning other wells which were being impacted by non-nestle related perchlorate pollution.  

The outrage over such a small well when a review of the MDEQ site shows some 20k gpm wells is kind of strange.

EDIT: I've dug in a little more; the true irony is that nestle is upping this well to account for the water table rising in the Evart field (where they had been pumping) because NEIGHBORS WEREN'T WITHDRAWING ENOUGH and the water table rose and encountered industrial pollution from 50 years of fireworks launched by the county fairgrounds making the water unusable.        

The "outrage" headline piqued my curiosity as 200,000 gallons isn't a whole lot.   So I went for the data.  The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality [publishes water consumption data](https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3313_3684_45331-370128--,00.html).  The Industrial-Manufacturing sector used 793,308,692.9 gallons per day in 2016. That makes this 200,000 about 0.025% of the total in that one sector in Michigan.  That sector itself is only 8.6% of the state's use.  The large majority of water use is for electricity generation.

200,000 is a lot when you compare it to the fact that an individual person uses about 100 gallons a day.  But I don't think most people realize just how [much water get used in other sectors](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wateruse-total.html).  Public water is less than 15% of the fresh water used in the USA.  Electricity and irrigation are each about one third.
Here's my perspective as a stream ecologist:

200,000 gallons is 0.31 cubic feet per second.

A stream containing that amount of flow would be small enough a small child could step across it without getting wet. Even the slightest variation in rainfall will affect every river and stream large enough to be named in the state by a larger amount than that almost daily.

It really is a drop in the bucket.

Without knowing the details of the specific withdrawal site, or whether or not their deal involves fair payment relative to what others have done, I really can't judge the merits of this specific proposal. And it is worth noting that cold groundwater is more valuable ecologically than surface water. But the amount here is still so small that I'm inclined to trust the officials at MDEQ when they say they reviewed it adequately.

I'm all for jumping on large corporations when they're screwing up the environment, and part of my career involves finding ways to do that. But this seems more like outrage over a poor choice of units (they might as well say "7.3 billion gallons!" per century) and Nestle's reputation than the actual likely impact of this withdrawal.
I am saving this comment because it really has shown me how hypocritical I can be. I have to remind myself every. single. day. that not everything I read is legit and that the comment section on Reddit is usually just normal people having an opinion on something without all the facts. I fit into this category (in this situation and quite a few others) and it really grounded me. I was already buying my ticket aboard the Nestle hate train and then I found this comment. Thank you for the reminder. Sometimes it takes a kick in the hypocritical nutsack to put things into perspective.
I posted previously about usage, and this guy is right.  I'll also add some perspective.  

Nestle wants 576k gallons per day.  Farms back in 2004 were doing 187 million per day.  

It's absolutely insane to hate nestle *for this* of all things.
Thank you for this post. Wish more discussions had such rich comments.
Thanks for posting this. People get way too caught up drooling over outrage porn and don't bother to look into the details. 

If Nestle were extracting excessive amounts of water to the point where ecological damage was being done, I would be mad at the regulators who permitted it.

There are other reasons to be mad at Nestle. I hear they pulled some awful stunt with baby formula in Africa.
That's an Olympic size pool every 3 days. Sure it's a lot, but it isn't THAT bad. 100 Olympic pools a year.... 
Civil Engineer here.     

&nbsp;

Just did some quick math to understand what impact this increase is to the watershed. **These are just numbers I found from a quick search and would only provide a rough idea of impact.** The methods are a lot more rigorous and detailed if you are looking at it from a permitting perspective.    

&nbsp;

According to Michigan University^(1) the total size of the watershed of Lake Michigan is 45,600 sq. miles or 127 trillion sq. ft. According to NOAA^(2), the long-term mean annual rainfall for the Lake Michigan watershed is 32.8 inches or 2.73'. This means daily, Lake Michigan receives about 9.52 billion cubic feet of rainfall or 71.2 billion gallons. **This means that the 200,000 gallon increase is 2.8 millionths of the total daily intake. In other words, very very very small.**   

&nbsp;

What are the problems with this kind of an analysis? In order to do some proper math you would have to look at the "minor drainage basin" of the nearby area and do the same analysis using the local numbers. Furthermore, rainfall varies by season and our method of averages fails when it comes to considering it's impact during different parts of the year. Unfortunately I am at work and am unable to find out exactly which drainage basin this. I would love to see if someone else can produce some numbers.   

&nbsp;

With all this being said, I understand why the permit was allowed. **The rough numbers in addition to what others in this thread have said, support that the local jurisdiction finds the withdrawal to meet standards.** In my opinion, this is the most important distinction we should be making independently from the outrage considering that the outrage is really in response to the years of negligence and malpractice in providing safe and necessary infrastructure to the region.

Ann Arbor, Michigan, gets 36 inches of rain per year.
Ann Arbor is 28.70 sq miles, 800,110,080 square feet.
So 2,400,330,240 cubic feet of rain land on just Ann Arbor each year.
That is 17,955,717,120 US gallons. 
There are about 525,949.2 minutes in a year.
Or about 34,139 GPM of rain fall just on Ann Arbor. 

Anyone care to do the calculation in the region/water table where Nestle is pumping water?

 Note: This is the type of calculation they do at DNR.... it is called math.



Thank you! Fuck nestle but there is no way the Michigan DNR would allow this if it would have an impact on the lake. 
Thank you for your objectivity. Regardless of what side of the aisle you're on, we need more of this in our society and especially on the internet!
Pretty sure that if someone wants to yank h2o out of any state and sell it elsewhere, Michigan is probably the best pick of the 50. Just my opinion, them having a huge fresh water supply and awesome natural refresh rate.
Well said. The same situation is happening with Nestle in British Columbia. By situation I mean the hordes of idiots who are foaming at the mouth because they think somehow, Nestle is going to drain our province dry of water.

It's especially hilarious in Vancouver when we have so many breweries opening up and people are fucking jerking their dick all over the breweries saying how great it is for Vancouver, when it takes way more water to produce 1 L of beer than it takes to produce 1 L of bottled water. 
Here's the thing though. Water is a commodity not to be sold. So Nestle is getting g it for free to sell it and make a profit. 

I do appreciate your points, don't get me wrong, but to me the biggest problem is bottling water in plastic bottles which is detrimental to the environment in production and disposal. Not to mention that plastics begin leaching into the water inside them after a while. This is toxic on so many levels and that is just disgusting and irresponsible 


Eta: also the important thing is that everyone should have access to clean drinking water through their tap. Bottled water should not become a necessity for survival.
Also this is like 100 something miles from Flint
Those 75 got their Nestle checks
This is the same shit that happened with Net Neutrality. This country's BS level is getting insane.
We don't live in a representative democracy anymore. Citizens are getting shit on, and corporate power needs to be completely eradicated from government.
Of those 800,000 people, I wonder how many have stopped drinking bottled water entirely? 

I keep heading this rhetoric that corporations run everything in America, but where do corporations get their money from? *People consuming their products.* 

If nearly a million people stopped buying bottled water it would make a noticeable dent in Nestle‚Äôs bottled water division. If nearly a million people **stopped buying Nestle products all together?** That would make a huge dent in the corporation. 
This is a horrible situation, and I despise how a corporation can pay off politicians, and apparently people to write into their politicians.

Also,  how much do they pay?  (asking for a friend)
Just because more people oppose it doesn't mean those people have a clue about why they are angry.

200,000 gallons a day is fucking nothing, a small stream will output that. And what's more is that this is in michigan, in the fucking great lakes area. There is damn near nothing that could be done by humans that could cause a fresh water shortage in the area. 
Government is run by bitches.  Corporations are the pimps, not you and your dirty unwashed masses.
The reason why is because it's really easy to get 80,000 people outraged about something insignificant when a bad company is doing it, and it's really hard to get people to say anything in support of ordinary government procedure.
Those 75 are Nestl√© employees 
Because it's a trivial amount of water, and there isn't a very good reason to deny them for that reason?

I hate bottled water and think it should go away, but not because of the water use, which is insignificant, but rather the energy and plastic pollution.

Farmers use 1000x this amount of water
Eh, not as bad as when BC sold Nestle their water for something stupid like 4$/Billion gallons.
Step 1: sell water to nestle 

Step 2: nestle bottles the water 

Step 3: sell the water to people without clean water

Step 4: profit 
**FLINT MICHIGAN HASN'T HAD CLEAN WATER SINCE 2014.**

Fuck all of them. These are Americans that haven't had drinking water in FOUR years. Third world BS. 
Their fee was waived. They're doing it for free. The politicians that approved this are the same ones using public tax dollars to pay for their criminal defense lawyers in regards to the poisoning of the city of Flints drinking water. That happened because the same people, who were re-elected by the way, made the choice to not treat the fucking water. Everything about Rick Snyder, his administration and our state legislature stinks like a fucking sewer. 
They're using a fraction of a percentage point of the available water and they stimulate the economy. Nestle has done some bad stuff, but bottling water for human consumption is not one of them.
This is their worldwide modus operandi. 
That's what happens when the population accepts their politicians being bribed, sorry, "lobbied" as something perfectly normal. Politicians aren't going to change unless they have to. People need to wake up or they will always be fucked over in the name of big business.
it's actually not a big deal...

There is a total of ~20,000,000 gallons of water per minute (GPM), permitted to be extracted within the State of Michigan. Nestle will be increasing their extraction in one well from 250 GPM to 400 GPM, bringing their statewide extraction rate to about 2,175 GPM.
Nestle is approximately the 450th largest user of water in the state, slightly behind Coca-Cola.
Nestle won't pay for the water, because water is, by statute, not a commodity to be bought and sold within the State of Michigan, or any of the states and provinces within the Great Lakes Compact. Since it is not a commodity, it is a resource. This protects us from California or Arizona from building massive pipelines to buy our water as our natural resource laws prevent this. Residents also don't pay for water, rather we pay for treatment, infrastructure, and delivery of water, but the water itself is without cost.
The state denies lots of permit requests, but this request showed sufficient evidence that it would not harm the state's natural resources, so state law required it to be approved. The state law which requires this to be approved can be changed, but due to the resource vs. commodity thing that's probably not something we want.
It was approved because the laws and regulations require it to be approved if the states wants to continue treating water as a natural resource and not a commodity.
Water table isn‚Äôt being significantly depleted look at a map of Michigan please
It should be mandatory for these companies which do this practice to put money into environmental recovery, back into green technologies and so forth.
what do you think the marginal cost should be for taking freshwater out of the great lakes region?
This comment is disgusting, perspective like this is NOT why I came to the comment section
There's a need for legislation as agriculture is #1, golf courses are #2, and Nestle is way the fuck back of that.

Don't get me wrong. I don't like Nestle, but I don't blindly hate. 
Some people have to buy bottled water... like people in Flint.
In the 1990s it was a big joke. We'd poke fun at people who drank bottled water when tap water was available. Amazing and sad how well the marketing worked.
it's not.  Some tap water taste pretty bad.
Our tap water is so clean it tastes like pool water, so I buy bottled water. While most everyone in the US does have access to clean tap water, that doesn't mean it tastes good and not amount of filtering works on ours. I grew up on well water and I wish I lived in a house that wasn't on city water so I could have it again, but until then, bottle it is.
I pay for convenience.
Why is it a scam? Are the bottles empty? You're paying for a convenience.
It's not a fucking scam. Its clean, filtered, purified and very tasty water, available in a convenient, portable container. My tap water tastes like shit. My tap water with a britta tastes like shit. Forgive me for wanting to spend $0.09 on a 16 ounce bottle of water while I work out at the gym  Yes, I spend $1.99 for a 24 pack of purified water at Aldi. 
I was wondering about the uber-cheap bottled water I buy if I need it:

>Andrew Peykoff II (born 1976) is the owner of Niagara Bottling, the largest family-owned bottled water company in the United States[1]. Niagara mainly bottles private label bottled drinking water for national supermarket chains, along with Wal-Mart's "Great Value" brand and Costco's "Kirkland" brand.[2] He is of Macedonian descent.[3]

Weird.
Living in Pakistan, you have no choice. Unless you're g with getting sick daily with their bacterial filled water
Michigan resident here --

We are well aware that we aren't running out of fresh water any time soon when we're surrounded by literally 20% of the world's supply. 

The big campaign against this here was primarily because "fuck Nestle." Also, a few colleges (eastern michigan University in particular, I believe) have "ban bottled water" movements underway, and this directly conflicted with their interests.

This comment says elsewise : https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/8g0s23/outrage_ensues_as_michigan_grants_nestl√©_permit/dy86qyo
Look below at my comment, 194 billion gallons a day evaporates from Lake Michigan during peak season 
No they don't. The people upvoting this meme are basically plant life.
There are 1.29 quadrillion gallons of fresh water in Lake Michigan. At the rate Nestle is drawing water, it would drain the entire lake in six million years. 
Let's put it this way: just the evaporation off of lake Michigan is over half a trillion gallons per day.
[You're gonna need to boycott a lot more than that] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)

>overall water usage in the region

The state of Michigan has 20,000,000 GPM (gallons per minute) of water available for pumping.

>Nestles water usage in the region (thus Nestles increase in water usage in the region)

Nestle is increasing their water usage by 150 GPM.

>a study that analysis how much of the water can be used in the mid to long term (or as long as the permit is for/can be replaced) wihtout depleting water levels in the region

Approximately 20,000,000 GPM. This figure changes yearly depending on rainfall and other factors, but for this current year, the state has determined that it is safe to pump ~20,000,000 GPM state-wide without damage to the watershed.

>So if what's on the Nestle website was true, and the amount of water used was minimal (or well under 0.1%) and the USGS said it was replenishable by nature

This is true.

>then what is the problem with this permit?

There isn't one. People are right to hate Nestle, since they're a garbage company, but this particular incident is a complete non-issue. People are just misinformed and want something to be angry about.
Michigan alone has access to just under 10% of the world's usable freshwater, as we have claim to 40% of the Great Lakes. 200,000 gallons is about what 2000 people use in a day. 
200,000 gallons is also a laughably trivial amount. 

It's 1/3 of a single Olympic sized swimming pool. You'll need 650,000 gallons to fill up just one pool.

People outraged about this have no concept of the scale of how much water is in the world and how insignificant 200,000 gallons is.
Flint is actually in the process of replacing its pipes and the majority of faucets in the city have output water under the federal limit for two years now. A few months ago tests said 95% of faucets output water under the 15ppb limit and the majority put out water under 4ppb. 
It's not about the details. It's about Fuck Nestle.
They should look at how much water  a paper mill uses. They would be shocked.   An efficient paper will will use 8,000 gallons of water to make a ton of pulp. Mills will make 1000-5000 tons of pulp per day. 

We are talking about 8-40 million gallons pr day pr paper mill.     

Michigan has at least 4 paper Mills. 
Overall the US has 450 paper Mills. 




Everyone always freaks out about these numbers because they‚Äôre big and scary. But they have no scale to compare it to and if they did they‚Äôd realize who gives a shit. 


Kinda upset I had to scroll so far to find your post 
My subdivision uses that much water a day.  A golf course uses more.  Hell the park across the street from me has 6 soccer fields and two baseball diamonds, plus some extra space.  We live in a desert so it‚Äôs all irrigated.  That park probably uses 200k a day.
[deleted]
Not only that but the Great Lake System is the worlds largest freshwater reserve and it's shared by the U.S. and Canada. If one country profits from depleting it that may cause international tensions to rise. 

Edit: I'm  not saying that Nestle will deplete the Great Lakes if they stick to 200,000 gallons a day. If they decide to just take more or if the agreement is altered to the point that they do begin to deplete them then that would be a problem. Basically Nestle has a foot in the door and that's  quite enough. 
Diversion of water out of the Great Lakes Basin is illegal, and can have some pretty massive environmental impacts.

Take [this example that occurred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) where overuse of water caused a massive lake to completely dry up.

This *can* happen to the great lakes.  And it will if the water is allowed to be diverted out of the basin.
I'm not saying buying bottle water is good. But they do sterilise the bottles with heat so bacteria is most likely killed. There is more bacteria if you keep refilling the same bottle.
I love this, "If there was  a smidge of bacteria in there (and there probably was)..." reads just like the thoughts I would expect someone with no concept of food sanitation and regulations to think. Stopped reading at that point, but I am genuinely curious do you typically make wild assumptions and then immediately support them as (likely) facts?
Bottled water is also a matter of convenience.  It's not a financially great idea, but that's the price you pay for convenience.  This concept also applies to much of the food people eat.  With that said, fuck Nestle and people littering those plastic bottles.
My well water tastes like complete ass, bottled water is the most convenient option.
nestle may be a bunch of rat bastards, but this "there are no health standards" mantra is balogna when it comes to their water. 

The military uses nestle as its primary supplier for bottled water BECAUSE they do a better job of cleaning and treating the water. 

Their water has a very long shelf life, and excluding poor storage conditions their water can last years before any spoilage.

If you care, I can educate you further on exactly how they treat ALL of their water products (spring and pure life). 

I have first hand experience as I have worked in their factory's in three different states and dealt daily with the quality control requirements. 

They may be a bunch slimy businessmen, I should know, and these are some of the primary reasons I no longer work for nestle waters. but they couldn't put unsanitary water in a bottle and sell it to people, it would make people VERY sick if they did. 

Outrage? From uneducated people? Surely you jest! 
Maybe they could force them to collect the water at the effluent of the Fox Conn plant, so we can watch the 2 companies destroy each other?
You realize the water is not gone forever, right? And that this makes nestle the 450th ranking water contract in the state? 450. 449 other contracts for water use more than this.

20,000 gallons of water is not a lot. We literally live on a planet covered in it. 
But foxconns is for the cooling towers.  More than half of what they are pulling is being returned.
I don't know where you are from, but water is not an issue for any of us in the great lakes region. Whether you hate Nestle or not, this isn't going to hurt anything at all. 
> piss away the worlds largest sources of freshwater.

Ever heard of the water cycle? Also, you realise that people are going to drink this water?
Reddit has a lot of activists and propagandists with an extreme hatred for capitalism and/or corporations. Many of them consider themselves woke and informed for having read or watched anti Nestle propaganda.
Yep... And that is just that lake. Not including the surrounding lakes that are just as big the 12,000 interior lakes and the ground water.

Michigan isn't going to run out of water
What else am I going to blow my money on!? I work and work and work.... I need my bottled water. 
I nominate /u/Dyanpanda to go attack the nestle plant. 
You first. 
No one wants to go to jail.
Here before this comment gets removed - it was suggesting someone 'disable' the nestle plant. 
> Why cant one of the 80,000 simply disable the plant? It can't be that well protected.

Well, maybe because it's illegal.
So what you two combined are saying is:

ITT: people raging because the title involves Nestle, water, and Michigan, even though this is actually not a real issue.

Yeah this really seems like a non issue. The dairy plant I work for in Michigan extracts 350,000 GPD and that's just used for cleaning, cooling, etc. Not like we're bottling it.
Also environmental engineer:

Agreed, nothing Nestle is doing impacts anything negatively in really any way.  They aren‚Äôt competing with Flint for water resources.  They are drawing from a different location, using their own private resources to pay for the extraction.

This permit being rejected would do nothing for anybody.  I have no idea why my fellow liberals, who purport to support science, would so brazenly ignore the actual facts and outcomes of this example.  There is injustice in Flint.  There is no injustice in this permit approval.
A thousand upvotes but I still had to dig to find this.
Living next to a Great Lake is great. You can leave your water running all day and it costs next to nothing. In Colorado it cost us hundreds a month to water our grass a few minutes a day.
It's because none of the people here(save for a few like you and myself) know anything about hydrogeology. 

I like ragging on big corporations as much as the next guy, but at least understand what you're mad about and not just blindly follow a hate narrative. 
Environmental engineer here, too.

Nothing to add, I just wanted to say hi.

Nice to see a fellow enve eng. Yes, the numbers reported by the article are sensationalized by people who do not understand the context of those numbers. Still not a fan of Nestle though
> I've dug in a little more; the true irony is that nestle is upping this well to account for the water table rising in the Evart field (where they had been pumping) because NEIGHBORS WEREN'T WITHDRAWING ENOUGH and the water table rose and encountered industrial pollution from 50 years of fireworks launched by the county fairgrounds making the water unusable.

Thank you. Definitely would have missed that.
> The outrage over such a small well when a review of the MDEQ site shows some 20k gpm wells is kind of strange.

Welcome to Reddit, where it's impossible to say something without someone getting up in arms about it.
A private inground swimming pool can be 20k gallons easy and not considered large.  I have a 13500 gallon above ground pool and it would be considered average.  An Olympic size pool will be over 600k gallons. Get on Google earth and check how many backyard pools you see.

I wonder how many people freaking out in this thread have 30k gallons of water in a hole in the ground in their back yard right now.
Trust in the DEQ (the permitting body here) is low, due to the Flint water crisis.  That's probably driving some of this outrage.
It's not a drop in the bucket, its a drop in the Olympic pool.  Lake Michigan alone is about 1 QUADRILLION gallons that are constantly being refilled by inlets and numerous other things.  I read they were also upping this amount because the water is rising too fast and they NEED to remove it. goddamn people.
How dare you bring facts into the circlejerk!

The people complaining about this are not likely to go collect their own water and bottle it. The outrage is a misinformed joke.
Here is a hint..

If the story "outrages you"...99% of the time you aren't getting anything close to the whole story.

Once you learn all the facts, you may still oppose something but rarely will you still be outraged
> I was already buying my ticket aboard the Nestle hate train

Keep your ticket, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to hate Nestle.  This just isn't one of them.
Yeah I just looked at the number of gallons in an olympic sized swimming pool to try and contextualize this, and one pool has 660,000 gallons in it. 

I'm not in favor of helping Nestle out in general, but this doesn't seem like an insane amount of water, especially if the lakes up there are as full as lake Michigan is at the moment.

"The water level of Lake Michigan continues to rise after generally staying below long term average values for over a decade. Below is a graph depicting the average Lake Michigan/Lake Huron water level since the late 90s.

 



 

The latest observed value of 176.73 meters, or 579.82 ft, is the highest recorded level since July of 1998! The peak of this summer so far is 2.13 ft higher than the average peak of the low level summers of 2012 and 2013.

How much water does 2.13 feet of lake add up to? For lake Michigan alone...that's 9.95 trillion gallons of water more than 2012/2013. For the combined Lake Michigan / Lake Huron Basin...it adds up to 20.17 trillion gallons!"
Reddit as a collective seems to find any reason to hate on Nestle. I can bet at least 10 people in this thread have already commented with the "water is not a human right" meme that the former CEO said nearly 15 years ago while ignoring all context.
Someone please explain then why I need to hate them? Seriously.  I know it involves water use and baby formula.  
Thanks! Sometimes the front page stuff is hard to make these kinds of comments on, but a lot of more niche subreddits do end up having a wealth of information. Thanks for the feedback and vote of approval üòÅ
Michael Phelps probably pees in 100 Olympic pools a year
Michigan DEQ, but yes, you're right. 
Wonder if f any of those 75 are redditors
The 75 that voted yes, work at Nestl√©.
The image that popped into my head was a check printed on a Nestle Crunch bar.
You mean employed at the facility using the water? 
[removed]
AND/OR diddled the wrong person in a public bathroom.
I miss the days where we could assume the malicious had a financial stake in things - but it has proven much more cost-effective to use propaganda.  I'd bet those 75 simply believe we can replace 200,000 gallons of water with librul tears.
Naw man. 75 people didn't get paid. Soros is funding the over 80000 to be anti water. Wake up sheeple
All it's done is bring into the spotlight that we the people control jack shit at this point. Corporations are what control our government, and even when we think we're voting and choosing our government there are actually corporations in the background fucking with us. Our opinion doesn't mean shit.
how isn't lobbying classed as bribary at this point?
I hated the we "cannot base [our] decisions on public opinion because the department is required to follow the rule of law when making its determinations" bit.

...Then you change the goddamn law, or you give up on democracy. 
[deleted]
It's an oligarchy.
Remember how religion used to be the driving power and that's why the founding fathers pushed for a secular government?

The new governments will be secular and devoid of any corporate influence
Isnt Michigan a republican controlled state  and isnt republican policy is to remove all regulations to let corporations grow so that wealth can trickle down. How is this any different from their normal policy?
>corporate power needs to be completely eradicated from government.

Corporate power needs to be completely eradicated from society, it's a pure cancer. Your realization will ultimately lead to the realization that capitalism must fall if humanity is to survive.
A little [reminder](https://i.imgur.com/4qgakGe.jpg) of what those are.


Edit -- Here's a better [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands), I think it gets bigger every five minutes.


Sadly, consumption of bottled water continues to grow. Nestle is keeping up with demand. 
They can't just drink tap water.  That's the problem. They have no other access to drinking water, making it impossible for them to live without purchasing nestle water.  

But USA is a third world country so it's not surprising.  
Just because I give a company money because I enjoy their product, it doesn't mean that company should be able to use that money to influence our government/legislative process in any way. It's hard to blame corporations for taking advantage of a broken and highly competitive system. The issue is the political system itself being so easily corruptible. And it's only getting worse before it gets any better.

It's time we stop blaming the corporations for doing what corporations naturally do when controlled by large groups of shareholders seeking higher profits. These aren't humanitarians who work for the people. Politicians, on the other hand, are supposed to be working for the people and not the corporations or themselves. We hire/elect politicians to look out for OUR best interests, not theirs.
[Often times, for the little guys, it'll just be a few thousand dollars. High profile personalities go for more.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution).
They didn't need to pay off anyone. There are objective rules written into the laws and regulations for wells in the state that set objective conditions that if you meet you can take water from wells.

The 80‚Äâ000 comments had no impact not because someone was paid off to ignore them, but rather because they didn't raise any arguments that Nestl√©'s proposal failed to meet the required hydrological conditions.
Let's not go about besmirching the names of whores and pimps, they at least see the value of the customer.
This is where someone come along with the article/study that states that more than 4000 communities in the US have lower quality drinking water than Flint.  Then we get all angry for a little bit before forgetting about it.

Ah, screw it, here are some:

Actually, I think the water‚Äôs been bad before that. It‚Äôs only in 2014 that it entered the public stage.

Worse yet, flint isn‚Äôt the only city that has had undrinkable public water‚Äî the problem with leaded pipes being severely outdated and leeching contaminants into public water is a problem in a great deal many places across the United States 
Consider the possibility that this is no different than the healthcare situation, only that is much more spread out. People getting screwed because they don't have the resources they need to survive; meanwhile the nation as a whole has more than enough resources to solve the problem. Instead, our own government lets us die for money.
> Testing has showed the levels of lead in the city's water have been below the federal limit for nearly two years. The water's quality is "well within the standards," Snyder announced Friday

Did you read the article or any other coverage? Flint water is and has been clean for a while now. And when the public water wasn't clean, they got clean bottled water for free. 

https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/07/us/flint-michigan-water-bottle-program-ends/index.html
Holy shit. I hadn't even realized that much time had passed.
Since they need to replace all the pipes it's going to take something like 20 years to fix the problem. 
Enjoy Congressman Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania putting the shit to Snyder.

> who were re-elected by the way

This is the thing. People complain but collectively seem incapable of figuring out what is causing the harm. I don't have a better idea, but democracy is fundamentally broken when applied to a world as complex as ours.
Well, like you said, the state re-elected the same people responsible for poisoning the water. You can‚Äôt fix stupid. 
This is a gross simplification of the issue. No one *decided* not to treat the water. The water managers were incompetent, or were unaware, or were lazy. In any case, it would have been normal protocol to treat the water, and they should have, and were not ordered not to. You can make the case that, had the EM at the time not pushed the issue through to fast, the water authority would have had better time to double check things and add the phosphate needed. But make no mistake: the switch could have, should have, and *would have* been done without risk to the water system and without the resulting lead contamination issues, but the folks at the water control agency fucked it up. 

Also, those being prosecuted are being prosecuted for the cover up. By covering up the crisis, they (allegedly according to the law, probably according to the science) prevented the proper maintenance of residual disinfectant in the water, allowing a legionnaires disease outbreak which killed multiple people. 

Hell, the EM that presided over the water switch is not being prosecuted. He was out before the cover up began. 
Michigan violated Rule #1 of politics:

*Never* vote in a guy named Rick.
They pump less in a year than what is collected naturally in a month. The idea they are depleting water tables is asinine. As is the idea they are getting the water for free. They pay taxes on the water. The cost of the permit covers filing/worker costs for the department and is a flat rate permit cost regardless of project size.

So much misinformation on this topic. 
I used to work at a plant in TN that extracted 1,800,000 gallons per day of water from private wells. This is nothing.
So many people outraged at this article have zero idea what's going on. It's like they don't know basic geography, or realize Michigan borders some of the largest freshwater lakes in the world.
If only there was some way to enforce this.  I don't know, like maybe a system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties?  We could give it an easy name, like "law." Yeah, that would be awesome.  And then like, if they break "the law" we enforce penalties or "consequences..."
I don't want perspective, I want blind, indiscriminate, uninformed outrage! YEAH  BROTHER! 
and a big check goes to the people who keep Flint dirty. 
Wouldn't it be ironic if that water was taken from a place nearby for free by a for profit company and then shipped and sold to those peo... oh wait.
It's getting better in Flint, thankfully.
Their water has tested as safe to drink for two years.
y2k standardized buying bottle water. 
I wonder if we were under-hydrated as children or if current generation kids are over-hydrated. I grew up in the 70's and 80's. Nobody had drinks of any sort with them during class at school. There were water fountains in the halls that we'd drink from. Of course we also drank from garden hoses during the summers when outside playing all day.
I can't stand the pool taste, either. I use a Brita pitcher and it tastes fine.

> not amount of filtering works on ours.

RO filtering works on all water, it just isn‚Äôt super cheap. 
I had to have a well drilled for my house last year (in Michigan).  The permit cost me about $100 and I had to have someone out to verify the location of the drill would meet certain requirements.  I think it's handled on a county level.
My parents have a well in Michigan. They just dug it. No permits needed.

I'm sure there's a limit to how much water you can remove before the government gets involved, though. They had to intentionally waive the fees for Nestle.
Six billion years actually.

1.29 * 10^15 / ( 2 * 10^5 ) = 6 * 10^9
Woohoo! I don‚Äôt see anything on that list that I buy! Take that Nestle! Ka-pow!
Wow, I already buy almost none of their products. Kind of amazing, actually.
And every other company that gets essentially free water. Do people really think it's just Nestle?
Purina is shit anyways
 there goes lunch
Your pet will thank you
You don‚Äôt want to anyway. My dog almost died from melamine poisoning from a tainted batch of Purina dog food. It‚Äôs all made in China and they‚Äôve had 3 class action lawsuits over dog and cat poisonings. 
Unfortunately it's hard to recommend other brands because Nestle owns many of them. I do like Ben and Jerry's but I'm scared to see who owns them. Also Talenti gelato is delicious.
Thanks my dude :)
There‚Äôs no way a small water plant will exceed the replishment.  200k gallons is what a medium size subdivision or a golf course uses.
[deleted]
That lake dried up because they diverted water that fed into the sea towards a desert.

The great lakes loses 29 Billion galleons of water every day due to evaporation. This isn't something that is going to destroy the lakes.
That's why we have dishwashers that we can put water bottles in.
Having worked in several different food processing plants, I suspect that the process isn't as "clean" as people are lead to believe. And I think there is this huge misconception that bottled water is somehow cleaner than what comes out of the average household tap. Yes, there are exceptions to that too. 

The impact of bottled water to the environment is huge though. I don't think that people realize what is happening... or they just don't care. I know a lot of people who figure that it isn't going to affect them in their lifetime so who gives a shit. Just throw that empty water bottle on the ground, out the car window, on the street... wherever. Why should I care? I'll be dead before it matters. Part of the reason we have a plastic garbage patch the size of France floating around in our ocean.... but that is far away and won't affect me... so again... why should I care about that?
"... let them fight..."
To people on this site water might as well literally leave the planet via solar winds after Nestle bottles it or Foxconn runs their cooling tower.

Add to your stats average person uses 80 gallons of water a day, this is equal to 250 people moving to Michigan.
> Michigan isn't going to run out of water

And I swear that's what redditors seem to think is going to happen. Someone in /r/Canada legit did the full math on lakle Ontario as an example, and doubled up Nestle's consumption rate to to make the end number smaller. And it worked out to lake Ontario's water level going down like 2 inches over the course of 100 years or something ridiculous like that. I wish I saved his post because the dude went into ridiculous detail showing his work and end results.
I second the motion.

We will tell tales of his compassion.
Yep, pretty much.
Welcome to r/news
> The Michigan-Huron system is up about 3 feet since 2012.

That's actually a huge increase holy shit. Anecdotally I've only seen gains around 1 to 1.5 feet in Wisconsin over that time frame.
Used to have like 10 yards or so of beach at my lake house and now we‚Äôve had to put boulders in front of the bluff so it doesn‚Äôt erode our porch into Lake Michigan
Yeah Lake Huron has been crazy high the last couple years. You can notice stuff like people's steps that used to go to their beach are now in the water, and the small break walls are practically underwater.
Before I react to that I'd like to know what the 20, 50 & 100 year elevations are. Up 3 feet over 5 years could still be down 20 feet from historical average. 
One inch of one square mile of water is 17 million gallons. 200,000 daily is absurdly miniscule. Michigan-Huron has 2.2 quadrillion gallons of water in it. I live in Michigan and am well worried about things like pollution of the water, but people like to look at me like some traitor when I say these water extractions are a nonissue. I'm not sure anything short of total nationwide industrial mobilization could move enough water out of the Great Lakes basin to cause significant long-term damage.
> I have no idea why my fellow liberals, who purport to support science, would so brazenly ignore the actual facts and outcomes of this example.

So like.. Were you not around the last time GE crops, fracking etc came up?
>  I have no idea why my fellow liberals, who purport to support science,

Sadly there's a small but loud fringe of the left that ignores science as eagerly as the right and for the same reason: they value their uninformed feelings more than the truth.  

Sadly, it's a sect that thrives on this site.
One of us... One of us... 
The Flint water crisis is a result of poor infrastructure though, the DEQ has nothing to do with that.
I could be wrong since I'm a foreigner but I imagine why it catches peoples attention is because even though the two are unrelated, hearing nestle taking water and flint not having clean water together sounds like a scandal. The  two are obviously completely unrelated but that's not what matters to people trying to get clicks and sell papers!
Absolutely agree! It is hard to condition oneself to not be outraged from the initial reading of comments and understanding the history of why people hate Nestle. 
> ‚Äú... reasons to hate Nestl√©...‚Äù


Both you and u/tempinator said the same thing so I‚Äôll throw this question to both of you: what are some of the biggest reasons you have to hate Nestl√©? I‚Äôm really uninformed about their actions and policies and I‚Äôm really interested to know what they‚Äôre guilty of doing.
Altogether the Great Lakes have some 6,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of fresh water, which is 21% of Earth's entire supply of fresh water. Michigan is basically a peninsula sticking out into a vast freshwater sea. The state is surrounded by fresh water on 3 sides.

People are scared by 200,000 being a big number without understanding what 200,000 gallons actually is. Reddit also likes to hate Nestle. Granted, Nestle has done some despicable things in the past, but bottling beverages isn't one of them. People drink these bottled beverages. Nearly every last drop of water used to produce these beverages is used for human consumption.

In the grand scheme of things people really don't drink much water. Agriculture is what uses something like 90-95% of water. Industry uses the remainder. The amount that people actually drink is so tiny it wouldn't be visible if you were to turn water usage into a pie graph.
It turns blue when there are canabinoids in the water!  
They should do an AMA
I am not one of the 75, and I live only a few miles from one of the townships that has been fighting Ice Mountain (Nestle) against increasing production from a well they have been using.

There is, for sure, not a lot around here who want it.

Edit: after a refresher on local news, they wanted to increase production from 250 gallons a minute, to 400.
Hi, I'm one of the 75, AMA. I did this because I am actually a villain from captain planet with no real motivation except harming the environment....well, maybe making money too.

which is why we need to start fighting back
It's also important to realize that the average voter is not always the most qualified to make certain decisions \- and the ones that tend to vote on certain issues tend to be the most zealously paranoid about change \(like old people voting against net neutrality which they know fuck all about type of thing, or against funding schools because they don't understand how important a school is to drawing in new families to their town who support their town with taxes and paying into local businesses\).

I'm not saying the public should be disregarded, but that the popular vote is not the only important metric for deciding what we should and shouldn't do and why it's not used to make all decisions.
The problem is people don't go out there and vote for candidates that actually align with what they want. So many people show up and cast a vote simply for red or blue across their ballot.
Government is pointless, the solution is to stop buying Nestle products.
Your opinion is worth something only if you vote accordingly. Republicans have been very clear that they are on corporations side but yet people still vote for them (both directly or by not voting). So you are wrong, this is what people of Michigan wanted. If you dont vote, then politicians have really no reason to care about you and unfortunately a big chunk of US population just chooses to stay home and complain.

Given who controls Michigan this should be no surprise to anyone.
That's why your 2nd amendment is also a joke. No one is brave enough to use it to make real change. Everyone says they need a gun to protect against govt over reach. What do u think is happening? I think Congressional approval is like 10%. Yet people never take up arms. Hilarious. Just a lot of talk. Sort of how the gop talked about repealing Obamacare for 7 years and when they finally got the chance didn't. It's all just nonsense.
If only people could be declared people by the Supreme Court, then it would be a fair fight with corporations.
We have to learn that we are the ants, and the corporations are the grasshoppers.

It can start by making your state officials responsible for their actions. Recall every motherfucker that's responsible.

The other thing is not buy any of nestle's shit. I have listed this article that shows, on a chart, everything that Nestle owns.

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1458812

Most of what Nestle owns is not everyday needs, so it's easy to not buy their product.
I work in the solar industry in AZ. The way utilities work out here is by territory; where you live determines who your utility provider is. Not only that, but they pass rate increases through the AZ Corporation Commission, which are always approved. 

Not only are utility rates outrageous, but they are voting to kick private solar out of AZ and make it less incentivizing to go solar by lowering the buyback per kWh constantly which has been approved and probably will keep getting approved. We don‚Äôt have a say, and the AZ corporation commission is bought by lobbyists.. We‚Äôre the land of the sun.. and it‚Äôs actually getting approved to prevent solar coming into AZ. To top it off, APS‚Äôs CEO is getting paid $1 million a month!

> But USA is a third world country so it's not surprising.

Bro, I get what you're saying here, but it just comes off as silly.  The USA is *the* first world country.  The term is defined around the US.  
Everyone needs to read these. Thanks for the sources.

The number of ppl that have replied to me to say "they got bottled water though! It meets lead guidelines! Well it's the pipes, they can't replace them all!", please take a second and remember that you're talking about the self proclaimed "Greatest Nation in the World". If THAT'S the standard that you are happy with, then by all means, I have nothing more to add. Happy you're happy with that!

However, try bathing, cleaning and cooking with bottled water. Now do it for a couple years. Fun right? Can't imagine why the locals would ever complain after being given bottled water. I mean, they do the same when providing aid to third world countries so why aren't they more grateful right?!
Absolutely, and _equally_ unacceptable.
That issue is a whole other complex beast though. It‚Äôs not just government corruption that causes unclean water in Canadian natives - there are social and cultural issues that are preventing them from getting clean water.

To point fingers at just one group is unfair, at least in Canada‚Äôs situation.
It was an open secret to not drink the water in Flint for decades.
It's not just Detroit. We are witnessing the looting of the nation by the people who are supposed to be its leaders. 

People can claim that politicians have always been corrupt, but I'm in my mid 40's and I can tell you we have hit a new and unprecedented level of corruption for the US. 
Hahahahahaha Dan Gilbert and Rock Consumer Products are already here. 
This isn't really related at all to Detroit homie
I struggle to see how this has anything to do with Detroit. It's the state, not the city. How is Detroit turning more and more into RoboCop Detroit? You sound like some hack from Macomb.

Signed, an actual Detroit resident.
Hell, it would better if ICP were running things.
Detroit isn't the issue here. It's Flint and the surrounding area, about an hour to 2 hours away from Detroit, depending on where exactly you are.

Detroit is trying to fight through after all the years of horseshit, but nothing will change as long as the people here keep voting party over responsible, reasonable candidates (and that goes for both sides).
Extra sad that Robocop Detroit was actually Dallas. Detroit was too nice for the movie just 35 or so years ago. 
No it isn‚Äôt, dude. I grew up in Michigan. The art scene is exploding. Clearly you don‚Äôt know what the mayor was like in the 80s.

My dad drove an ambulance back then. People got shot for their sneakers. You make a blanked statement about Detroit because it‚Äôs easy to reference robocop and get non-detroiters to upvote you.

Numbnuts.
Funny because there was just an article today on NYTimes about how Detroit has made a comeback.
You get your sanity and ideas of personal responsibility the fuck out of here.  Dont you know where we are? :-)
Majority of the population is under/misinformed and doesn't vote and justifies it by claiming their vote doesn't count. Which is exactly what these politicians want them to believe. 
It's not that democracy is inherently broken per se, often the problem is that "the people" break it due to stupidity, tribalism, ignorance or disinterest. I mean, the amount of people voting against their own interests for whatever reason (and not just in the USA) is mind-blowing, and society as a whole pays the price for that.
> democracy is fundamentally broken when applied to a world as complex as ours.

This is a lie.  The problem is that "democracy" in the US is shackled to a hierarchal socioeconomic system that thrives on and propagates systemic inequality.  Democracy can only work when everyone is both educated and equal.  In the US, the ruling class suppresses education of the lower classes, to the point where most people actively, sometimes passionately, work against their own interests, much less the common good.  
Is Michigan gerrymandered by any chance? I highly doubt people are *that* far gone.
A vastly destructive decision was made, against the advice of experts, to save some money. Incompetent doesn't cover it. It's criminal malfeasance.
They chose not to spend 100 bucks a day to treat the water. It was a financial decision made by the puppet EM. The EM doesnt make a decision unless its ok'd by the governor. Bill Schuette is covering up the cover up and the deliberate decisions made by the governor with the bullshit charges against mid level people. 

This administration has done nothing but poison a city, hand out hundreds of millions in corporate tax breaks and force a gas tax down our throat that we voted down in a special election. Meanwhile, our roads are completely fucked. I dont think these issues are specific to Michigan though. I'm just fed up. 
Floridian here, can confirm. Thankfully, our Rick is term-limited. 
Yes and maybe we could create a regulatory body charged with upholding these laws and regulations. On second thought, let's make it, but then put a guy in charge of it whose entire purpose in life is to destroy the thing he's now in charge of. 

Cool. Cool cool cool. 
Not only that, but WHAT IF they also have some trustworthy *council* that can explain inarguable, scientific facts that they can base their decisions on? Wouldn't that be GREAT?!
The state government?
Source on that? 
The sad thing is that people just ignore this...I live in flint and water has been drinkable for some time now
I think it's from the amount of salt and sugar in our foods today requiring us to drink more water.
[removed]
What should I use instead? 
Well to be fair if any food used properly turns to shit. 
I like it. It's got a boldy meaty aftertaste that pairs well with a can of friskies. 
See that‚Äôs what we thought but our vet told us to feed Pro Plan to our dog so now I‚Äôm confused. 
Good boy.
No doubt. Purina dog food nearly killed my dog.

A dogs diet should be primarily protein and fiber. Anything made with beef, chicken, pork, carrots, beans, etc. is good for your dog. If it has corn in it, don‚Äôt feed it to Fido. A diet heavy in carbs and starches can cause all sorts of digestive and renal issues in dogs and cats.
You'll be fine looking into Ben and Jerry

For the love of god wash your reusable water bottles! 
I agree that bottled watter is a complete waste of materials for people to consume on a dialy basis. Also, that it adds to plastic waste and not everything can be recycled.

However, I believe that something like 75% of all the ocean plastic dumping comes from rivers in the developing world like China/India/Africa. The US actually has strict controls about plastic getting in the water from what I've read in the past.

Not that putting it in the ground is a great solution, but at least some percent of that get recycled.
See, I'm the first to grab a pitchfork, which is why I love hearing this informed, objective information. It's great. I can calm down and get some scope on the topic and realize it's not as awful as it sounds.  Objective, neutral reporting with facts is so great and it's becoming scarce.

Walking trail at Tawas state park is partially underwater. Walked that trail 10 years ago. Last summer the trail markers were 20 yards into the water in some areas. 
I know this isn't official, but I'm a 40yo resident and a boater.  I've never seen the water this high.  The current levels are just below many people's docks and seawalls and could cause a lot of issues if it goes up any higher. 
It's nearly at historical highs. Many areas built when the water was lower are currently underwater and low-lying areas are at risk of being underwater as the level continues to rise.
Data goes back to the 1910s, and historic peak was 1986 for Lake Michigan-Huron at 582 feet above sea level. We‚Äôre still about 2 feet shy of that but over 3.5 feet higher than the historic low set in 2013

http://lre-wm.usace.army.mil/ForecastData/BulletinGraphics/MBOGLWL-mich_hrn.pdf
Exactly.  The issue here is the water quality, not the water quantity like it is out west.  Michigan is surrounded by giant lakes and it rains and snows here all the time.  You could probably bottle water for the whole world population and not run out.
I'm just pointing out some sources of this outrage.  Others have already pointed out they're not logical.
Also most people don't understand what 200000 gallons mean and big numbers horrify people
Nestle should have a representative make an official statement.  Let's see if they can beat EA's high score.
Assault My Actions
They should get the water from Flint.
My husband‚Äôs grandparent‚Äôs well went dry in the last iteration of Nestle‚Äôs water draw. 

Because, really, what retired dairy farmers need to spend their money on is a new well after a giant corporation drained their aquifer....

Sigh. 
So when the "State" asks Oregon farmers to pay for grazing rights on Federally owned land, all the gun-totin' citizens take over a  wildlife refuge and an armed stand-off ensues. Along comes Internationally Vilified Nestl√© (baby-food abusers and H20 privatizing gangstas) and starts to steal the very water from under peoples' feet, and there's barely and outcry, and certainly no AR-15 packin' blockade. Hmm, I see the fight against Tyranny in all its forms is truly alive and well in the USA.
Captain Nestle, they're our villains, stealin tons of water by the millions
But the only people who can do anything about lobbying are being lobbied to not do anything about lobbying. 
Do something about Citizens United, do something about campaign finance generally, do something about lobbying, do something about voter suppression, do something about gerrymandering, pass laws to encourage more than just two parties. We need to reboot our democracy.
[deleted]
It's an empty threat so long as the only thing people do is online petitions and reddit complaints.  Seriously, for all the crazy gun-loving conservatives defending their right to bear arms, they sure keep finding reasons to turn a blind eye to political corruption.

Everyone is all talk.
we need to fight water with *water*  
> or against funding schools because they don't understand how important a school is to drawing in new families to their town who support their town with taxes 

I never really thought about this but everytime I hear about someone moving one of the biggest considerations is the school district. 
> It's also important to realize that the average voter is not always the most qualified to make certain decisions 

and whats happening here is any better? 

I've been thinking for a while that there should be a website/app where proposed bills and such are explained in a way that is easy for everyone to understand and list the pros and cons in a completely neutral way. There's a lot of information out there, and even if one were to do their due diligence, it gets confusing. 
But yet my GOP rep says the people should have the decision making power instead of "Washington beaurocrat" whenever it suits his narrative.
I've long been for every voter getting the same 3-5 multiple choice questions on the ballot, taken from the voter information guide.

The vote weighs up against how many questions they get right 

So you can't easily have tons of uninformed people swayed by propagandists voting on lies without the consequences of possibly discounting their vote.

Also you wouldn't be able to get things like proposition 32: the freedom and democracy bald eagle America act (screw over schools, pollute the environment, and send the profits off to Swiss bank accounts)
Thank you! Depressing to see so many people in this thread say "things are hopeless, its better if we dont even vote!" 

Like godam yall not voting is the reason we are even in this mess.
That's been a joke for forever. People either want guns for "self defense" or they just like guns. Neither of which is inherently bad or wrong. But the idea that we could ever forcefully overthrow our government without the support of our military is laughable.
Kind of how Trump was critical of Citizens United and vowed to repeal/overturn the decision if elected (I don't know if the POTUS can even overturn supreme court decisions), then hired on the president of Citizens United to be his deputy campaign manager in 2016.
Hey same. Only thing on that list I even semi regularly consume or use is Poland spring, and that‚Äôs only if someone is giving out bottled water. Otherwise I don‚Äôt use any of those things (unless someone gives me a piece of one of those candies for some reason). TIL I‚Äôve accidentally been a good person lol
Is the Kirkland brand dog food evil? I mean, Costco seems on the up and up but to be honest I don't know who actually makes the dog food.

For the record, I buy the *fancy* kind, because my dog is a princess.
Not sure if Costco is an option for you but their brand is pretty affordable.
What do you consider affordable? You get what you pay for...food of any kind is no different.
Taste of the Wild is good.
Eartborn Holistic, Taste of the Wild, Kirkland brand. All 5 stars on dogfoodadvisor. All reasonably priced.
Acana is great and made by good people. 
I pay about $65/month total for two 45 lb dogs. 
Fromm is another solid affordable food. 
Orijen is the best but is also the most expensive at around $90/26 lb bag 
But yeah look into Acana. Great company. Great sources. I switch between the fish and beef formulas mainly. 
Fuck haagen-dazs and it‚Äôs fake word name when you have Blue Bell.
Agreed, although it's worth mentioning that there is at least an effort being made. The program is under funded, and many aren't happy with it, but there has been progress in Canada. 32 advisories have been lifted under the current government. 
Same. Never seen this before, on this scale--and with so little shame.
Is it a new level of corruption OR is it that they don't even bother to hide what they do any more.  Or both.
IMO one of the biggest reasons for success in ‚Äúthe rise of China‚Äù is that the populace has been sold on ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù
Early 30s here, and I agree with you.  People used to say that corporations taking over the government was a possible dystopian future for the US.  

Today, people act like that's just capitalism, and libertarian idiots cheer the system on.  It's a mess, and we‚Äôre gonna turn into one of those shithole countries Trump was talking about if we don't put a stop to it.
In some senses even beyond what was portrayed in Robocop. 

At least in Robocop:

1. The police were still a public service (even if flawed and corrupt). Gilbert has his own private police force for his buildings downtown.

2. Robocop fought for "The good guys"
If it weren't too late ODB could save us all.
But, fucking magnets, how do they work? The people need to know. 
at least we'd have Faygo
Hahahahaha hahaha you should reasearch Detroit 35 years ago before saying that
This is why properly funding public education is so important.  


Nope, you've missed a critical factor, which is the power of money in disseminating propaganda. There's a,
 reason that people vote counter to their interests, and it's because they've been misled into believing that they're doing the opposite - which is the result of a system that hasn't been broken by "we the people", but by the actions of a powerful few. 
>They chose not to spend 100 bucks a day to treat the water.

Yeah, that's not true or even close to what happened.  Read a local newspaper for once in your life.

What happened was the Flint water treatment plant did not have the necessary equipment for adding phosphate.  The MDEQ said that was fine because according to federal law they needed to go through a couple of rounds of testing the water before adding the phosphate.  In the mean time they could add in the equipment and it would be ready by the time they needed to start adding it.  This is true, but only for systems serving less than 50,000 people, they should have been looking at a different part of the law that applied to systems with more than 50,000 people(I would like to point out that officials at the EPA did not catch this either).  That was fuck up number one, which had nothing to do with money or the governor or the emergency manager.  Fuckup number two.  The lack of phosphate allowed the acidic water to corrode mineral deposits exposing metal pipes(iron neutralizes chlorine) which led to an increase in bacteria(legionnaires outbreak).  This was noticed and to take care of the bacteria they added more chlorine to the water.  This caused more corrosion of the mineral deposits in the pipes exposing lead pipes and led to the GM plant leaving the water system due to the high amount of chlorine being used.  Now to Fuck up number three.  Due to budget constraints before any of this happened Flint never digitized their water line records.  The MDEQ was supposed to be measuring lead levels on lines that were at the most risk, basically they needed to be measuring lead levels on lead service lines.  However, all of the records were recorded on 3x5 notecards, many of which were illegible.  They basically had to guess because going through all of those notecards was basically an impossible task.  (now we know that many of the lines they tested were not in fact lead service lines, thanks to time and a team at a local university that digitized all the notecards) This lead to water reports showing that the water lead level was ok, even though we now know that the lines they should have been testing were not.

That is what happened, not this bullshit wanting to save 100$ a day.

I also want to add that the equipment to add the phosphate was installed in the Flint water treatment plant for millions of dollars.......Now why would they do that if they weren't going to add it to save money.

Also, you really think that with the size of the project of switching water systems(we are talking millions and millions of dollars) that anybody gave a fuck about saving $100 a day???

More examples of Republicans in office destroying everything for greed.  It has been seen as failing many states, and still was chosen to be the model for the nation as a whole.
And when someone is found guilty maybe fine the corporation an amount equal to all of the profits they made from their unethical practices and imprison any high level employees involved in the decision making process for long periods of time in standard prisons rather than luxury prison/country clubs. 
Honestly they had the perfect opportunity to help flint. Allow nestle to take water but either profits go to flint or they provide free bottled water to flint.

The fact this went without any of that on the table tells me they don't care
We feed our dogs Kirkland (costco) brand food.  Checks most of the healthy dog food boxes and supports a company that treat their employees fairly well which checks our good Samaritan boxes.
Costco's dog food
Is it for a cat or dog?

Edit: [dog food advisor](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/)

[cat food advisor](http://catfooddb.com/blog/cat-food-advisor)
Whatever you get, do the float test. Get two big bowls filled with water, and dump a cup of your current food into one, and the new food in another. Watch it for about 10 minutes, and you'll really learn something (particularly the Purina).
You know what the best food for your dog is?

One they enjoy eating and gives them energy and doesn't make them sick or give them diarrhea.

Not trying to be glib, but dog food research can leave you (it did me) in a state of anxious analysis paralysis until you look around and see everyone else's dog eating decent food (not $80/bag Arcana and also not garbage Kibbles 'n Bits) and living long healthy lives. 

I'm not calling premium (read: expensive) dog food a scam, but don't let anybody make you feel guilty for getting something affordable.

I feed my dogs raw because it's financially viable for me (they're little rat fucks) and when they need to be on kibble (like when I'm redoing my kitchen and I can't keep everything sanitary) I feed them Victor Pro Plus and they love it and it's not expensive at all.
My dogs eat banana, tomato, chayote, squash, cooked potato, homemade tortilla, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, eggs, occasionally cow lung, rice, oatmeal + more. Just filled their bowls w half oatmeal w a few chopped up sweet potatoes + half dog kibble. Yesterday one brought a rotting donkey leg in from the mountains + everyone took a turn at it.

Please look up for more, but there are things dogs should Not eat: chocolate, raisins (grapes), etc.

Imagine eating boxed dry cereal every meal of Your life. All dry dog kibble is not only super unnatural for them but it is expensive + according to my friend who served his dogs fish-potato-carrot mash, kibble causes cancer in dogs.

Hooray for dogs. F Nestle.
Taste of the wild or if you have Costco their Kirkland brand is the exact same.
everything about you disgusts me /U/SaladWithHotDogsInIt

Meh, it's less about the issue at hand and more about just finding something to get outraged about.
I'm all for the good times on Reddit that the top comment explains the situation, but also please don't mix this up with actual reporting. The top two comments are uncited claims, and I'm assuming you didn't check their facts before saying this. I'm not accusing them of lying, just reminding you to be wary of people telling you everything is fine without sources to back it up.
If you need to grab a pitch fork, grab it and head to Flint.
Yup, and the cold Spring meant there is still ice on the lakes. I expect this year to be the highest I have seen the lakes in the decades I have been going to Michigan. 
Squaw bay is back to normal if not higher than usual as well. For a few years after they started their contracts it was bone dry and probably 150 yards of sand.
Ah, gotcha.
Tell me the political party of the governor and I‚Äôll tell  you my outrage level.

That‚Äôs how it works, yes?
Thats absolutely it as well, average citizen has nothing really to compare that number to in our lives so it sounds insane.  I bet what I picture 200000 gallons to look like, and what it ACTUALLY looks like in the form of a lake, are vastly different things haha
‚ÄúWe want people to spend money to quench their basic need of thirst. In doing so, we are confident they shall feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.‚Äù ‚ÄîNestle, probably.
"Free, clean water is not a human right and someone should be making money from it so they can give back to the communities!" 
>Nestle should have a representative make an official statement.  Let's see if they can beat EA's high score.

Unlikely. People don't care about basic human services issues nearly as much as muh video games.
That is horrifying. Your grandparents-in-law should have a local channel come interview them. They are quite truly having their livelihoods stolen by a giant corporation stealing water straight out from under them.
Who wants me to join in lobbying against lobbying?

The ANTI-LOBYIST LOBBY!

Uuuh... Anyone got some change? I found a quarter, 2 nickels, and a paper clip. It's a start.
We just need to bring in the assassins.
That's not true.  The only people who can do anything about lobbying are too divided and apathetic to actually get in the streets and demand change like they need to.  
Also they get nice cushy lobbying positions after they leave office
Yo dawg
Genuine question: I actually want to start helping and pointing people in the right direction. I feel like writing to representatives isn't really doing anything..?
Where do I get information, who do I talk to, how does changing the way politics are done in this country actually happen? Is it even possible? :(


we elected a democrat for governor in Pennsylvania and real change is happening despite a republican congress who fought redistricting all the way to the supreme court.  
That's only going to happen if a group of people call for a rebellion and then kill most of the people in Washington and some heads of nstiinal and multinational corps. People dying is literally the only time in history when anything was meaningfully changed. 
I could not say this better myself.
You realize they cut themselves off from society right? Also who cares about Ajit Pai, they will just get someone else in there. Ajit is just the face for you to hate. The corporations put him in place to take the fall. The same thing with that Martin Shkreli, who cares that he was the CEO. There was hundreds of other people who planned and executed the price hike we saw. It was not 1 person.  
That's because when you threaten the sort of action that would actually be effective, you get arrested.

How many people "stood up" to trump at Marches? How effective has it been at changing his behavior? That's more than signing a petition, but it's still not force. And until it is force, it won't be enough. Nothing is going to change without *someone* suffering for it.

But go ahead. Threaten to make sure the people who suffer are the politicians. See what happens. Step one is your comment will be deleted. Step two is you'll be banned from reddit. Step three is you'll be visited by the FBI.

Freedom of speech is good right up until you need to use that speech to threaten harm upon the people in charge. Then it means nothing.
seriously. And it's a really big issue too

i mean i won't lie when i say i usually stand by but it's really starting to get on my nerves.
Why not something more effective against water, such as electric
It's a huge concern for parents of young kids. The difference between a low\-income school system and high\-income is huge, I was from a upper\-middle\-class area public school and when I went to college the kids that went to low\-income public schools barely understood order of operations while most kids in  my school were well beyond that by high school.

Not to mention the social climate difference. 

If you don't  bring in young, up\-and\-coming families, you have no new tax revenue, you're relying on just existing citizens with an aging population, you can't fund or expect to have people to pay into things like parks, malls, etc. that fund an economy and provide jobs. 

But old people just see "wasted tax dollars ra ra ra, what about my roads?"
Gerber, stouffers, butterfinger...I'm part of the problem.  :/
good question, i've found that kirkland products are usually great. My only concern is that Kirkland can just be a kirkland name on the same products produced in the same factories (but at a better price).
Kirkland brand dog food is made by Diamond, which a lot of people have a problem with.-

Mmmm, listeria.  Love me some frozen listeria.

As local news dies out to big business world news groups, get your asshole ready for a golden age of reaming as your local politicians start realizing no one cares anymore.
It‚Äôs always been this way just never seen. Communications are great. 
Or that with the internet we‚Äôre being exposed to a lot more of the corruption that‚Äôs probably been going on since the dawn of man. 
Or do we only know about it now because we have the internet, which they are also trying to corrupt?
Could you explain what this ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù they are sold on is? 

Is it the selling out of their people and the shit conditions they work for the good of the country?
Robocop was built by the corporations as a tool for 1) privatizing the police force and 2) getting away with anything they want. The fact that they were incompetent enough to leave his personality in tact and failed to make him their robotic slave doesn‚Äôt make the whole situation any better.
Don‚Äôt forget ya boiiee ED-209!!! 

TWENTY SECONDS TO COMPLY, SUCKAH!!

Edit: Don‚Äôt* not ‚Äúomg‚Äù lmfao
The Police weren't really a public service in Robocop, they were under the jurisdiction of OCP.
Which is why it'll never be fixed by the ruling class in the US.  
I don‚Äôt think that was an option in this case. Nestle got the permit from a regulatory agency, which enforces laws that are already on the books.  This wasn‚Äôt something that was discussed in the legislature, from what I understand.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think this is a ridiculous situation, and I‚Äôm not convinced the legislature would have stood up to this even if they wanted to. But the legislature would need to either change regulatory laws or some other sort of legal thing that‚Äôs above my head for this to be prevented. (From what I‚Äôve read)
Really? I have a membership there. I'll check out what they offer. I have cats though.
I've had a lot of problems with the company that makes the Kirkland dog food (diamond pet foods). I'd used a few of their other brands of foods, but on 3 different times, my dog got sick and then about a month later the food was recalled because of salmonella contamination. I've stayed away from all the foods they make since.
Okay but that site has Blue Buffalo as a 5 star but they apparently had lead tainted food knowingly.

I never know what to trust with pet food
Meh, DogFoodAdvisor is run by a dentist who rates food based on assumptions and ingredient lists (which don't tell the whole story).

Search threads over at /r/dogs instead.
dog food advisor is a shit blog hosted by an inept dentist who knowingly promotes tainted dog food because he gets a small share from each purchase linked from his site.

Not a bad perspective by any means. Trust and verify. 

Hydrogeology is pretty damned advanced and based on soil properties the impact of a well and even series of Wells can be fairly accurately modeled and would be prior to approval for a sizeable installation. That said I did not model this scenario and have not reviewed the submitted impact analysis. I have however submitted similar requests as part of my work duties though in MI so I'm not completely talking out my rear end.  
Weird we see this kind of "wariness" solely when it goes against what the pitchfork brigade is selling...
See, now this is the reddit I like.
I had no idea until I started fishkeepeing. At first I had a little 2.5g aquarium that was a breeze to maintain doing water changes with a gallon milk jug. Moved up to a 10 gallong and still pretty easy, just use a couple jugs instead of a single one. I have a 55gallon tank now, and gallon jugs don't even noticeably increase the water level.

Thank God for the python water change system.
Probably more like that jerk from BP - "We care about the small people"

"We hear your feedback, and we are listening. As we work through the kinks in the system to provide the best experience for the customer, we want to clarify to the community that it's never been about pay-to-survive, it's about providing the drinker with meaningful choice. That choice gives our members of the community agency and investment like never before."
um you tried making a joke but the truth is Nestle has said that water would be better managed in private hands

To be fair, people concerned about having their basic human needs met because it *personally* concerns them are probably doing other things with their time instead of lurking on Reddit, and may be a little too distracted elsewhere to toss their downvote.
Unfortunately, they wouldn‚Äôt have interviewed well. English is not their first language. Their kids/grandkids chipped in for a new well. 
You shouldn‚Äôt need to bribe your representatives to represent you. Political proposals should win on their relative merits, and that it doesn‚Äôt speaks volumes.
I've long been for a principled slush fund where money gets spent based on open rules. People can pool together more than Nestle and Comcast can spend and we can kick those bozos to the curb
Violent revolution is the only fucking option for this to ever change. And it will only worsen. 
> when I went to college the kids that went to low-income public schools barely understood order of operations while most kids in my school were well beyond that by high school.

Holy fuck. Order of Operations is 4th grade in America. When I was in HS I *started* in Algebra and had geometry, and pre-alg in middle school
I occasionally steal a butterfinger if they're in a bowl. I guess I have to stop doing that now. 
I may be constantly craving Wonka products. Dang. =/
IIRC it's produced in Diamond / Blue Buffalo factories. They had an issue with their food when Diamond did, and went through the same recall.
owned by Unilever...
That's how Mobile,  Alabama has always been. Steal, lie, and cheat. Get busted you just loose you job. With zero repercussions. It's crazy. The embezzling is insane. Zero repercussions. Just get fired. Pretty nice racket but sucks for us locals. Don't even get me started on the State. That way crazier.
Yeah I think this theory holds more weight. The transparency and access to this kind of information is much clearer than in recent decades. 

One of the most telling quotes I ever heard from a Chinese national was "I don't believe my government... but I trust my government." They know they're being lied to, but they also have a cultural memory of a century of embarrassment, invasion, civil war, massive famine and brutal incompetence. As long as the government seems to be moving the country forward as a whole, most Chinese seem far more interested in that than in personal or political rights.

The visible chaos in the US is the best advertisement for one-party rule any despot could ask for.
>Is it the selling out of their people and the shit conditions they work for the good of the country?

That's kind of how they sell it. It's like those old WWII posters telling people to not use resources in order to help the war effort and whatnot. Basically, 'work like a slave so the state can save $ and we'll be the biggest and most powerful country.'

Asians do have some very different ideas about individuality and such. I couldn't live there.  
It's more of they lacked the ability to make a competent fully robotic police. EDE we're good killing machines, but poor police officers. So they spliced in the killing machine part in to a human.
I really need to check out robocop
Robocop 2 showed that some personality is required or it goes insane.
The incompetency adds to the realism
Damn, you're right.

Let's go with "at least OCP had cool robots"
Not all of it though, some are better than others. [This is what I feed my dogs.](https://m.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Adult-Formula-Chicken%2c-Rice-and-Vegetable-Dog-Food-40-lb..product.100343454.html) I switched from natural balance to save some money, very good quality dog food. Check the ingredients. You want something that has the first ingredients as something of quality such as chicken, not like corn "something-meal" as well as having good whole ingredients.

Natures domain dry is what we use. They have a few flavors, our doggies like salmon :)
It's absolutely impossible to.  No sooner do you find a decent little company putting out good food do they get bought out by one of the big conglomerates and the product turns to shit overnight.
Wow, I had no idea. I usually do more research once I find something there and make sure other user reviews back it up. I thought the ingredients break down was really useful, there's no way to fake that, right? I get all my stuff from chewy these days though.
As the food saturates and loosens up, many things are released and floated to the surface of the water. With a grocery store brand food, you'll find a shocking amount of hair, and filler materials. Like, you'll feel bad about having been feeding that to your best friend kind of shocking.
We‚Äôre sorrrrrry 
So regular sized people are SOL?  Pro-dwarfism is just anti-regular sized.
Like when they said an oil spill will help a local economy 
Ohhh, that's gooooood. 
You must be in PR. If not, you're hired!
I fucking hate it when companies put "We Listened" on everything they do, knowing full well that they don't give a shit.
Wow. That reads exactly like a Betsy DeVos speech showing her barely disguised disdain for public education.
Well done
Almost shivered at the verisimilitude, dude.

Sadly, commercials work.  We don‚Äôt ever believe they work on us, you and me, but they work on everyone else of course.

So winning votes becomes more about the ability to run a lot of commercials.  Good policy helps too, but commercials are the key.  Get your name out there.

If we don‚Äôt want congressman to need to run commercials, then we need a thoughtful informed populace that has plenty of leisure time to investigate these candidates, grapple with the issues, and come to informed conclusions.

Heh.

Basically the donation isn‚Äôt a bribe in the traditional sense.  It‚Äôs more like a VERY powerful vote.
That is so beyond corrupt and is just a stupid solution to a larger problem.  The people shouldn't have to pay their senators to do right by them.  Gut the Senate,  and start over.  
I taught a summer program at my university where we identify incoming freshmen coming from bad schools and basically they take some beginner classes with a lot of help so they can be prepared when they start real classes in the fall. The ones who had order of operations down were my better students.


Although if it is any consolation I will say that order of operations is made up and not based in anything mathematical. It is just convenient for notation. In higher level math I just used loooots of parenthesis. 
I agree about the Costco brand for dog food, especially for dogs with wheat allergies. Ours developed a skin condition and Kirkland‚Äôs was great. If you‚Äôre looking for a quality wet food for cats, Petco‚Äôs Soulistic brand is affordable and held to the same standards as Weruva. The original line has actual chunks of identifiable proteins like salmon flakes, shredded chicken, and filets of tilapia. You can even do the recurring order from their site for free shipping on top of the % off discount. That‚Äôs the easiest/best peace of mind food I‚Äôve found. 
I second this for dogs. 
I'm losing sleep over this. My dog recently developed food allergies, and finding a good quality food is increasingly difficult. Losing sleep and my mind.
The same friend that prefers drinking the rain water from a mud puddle, and licks his butthole on the reg?
Soooo saray...
They listened for sure, and even nodded a few times in agreement, but for sure didn't give a shit.  
Exactly, and if we one day all work for the chocolate overlords then we'll all benefit!
Advertising is very persuasive. It‚Äôs a multi-billion dollar industry, because it works and artificially drives demand. It‚Äôs similar to propaganda. 
That won't work. Popular revolts reverse fairly quickly. Organized institutions with power and money end up recapturing the state and co-opting the language of the revolution, usually leading to a more oppressive state than before.

Look at the Arab Spring, where places which had a revolution are now controlled by authoritarian reactionaries. Look at communist china, the ANC in South Africa, BJP in India, Russia (either communist or post-communist), or Chavista Venezuela, which were started with the best intentions but then devolved to the elite regaining control and simply manipulating the masses in a different way. Corruption has its way.

Simply saying "no corruption" or presuming that electing good people will fix things doesn't remove the tools that pervert power - which will always be there. 

Until honest people start using those tools, they will always become used by them.
We're about to the point of just cooking for ours. I really don't know what else to do at this point. We've had to change food so many times now because of buy-outs it's almost a full time job keeping up with it.

How about real chocolate? None of this bullshit pseudo flavored chocolate, but the real fucking deal. And no more HFCS. 
I like Butterfinger the way it is!  I don't eat them for my health.  

Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!
>"Because Americans want them gone..."

Please. It is because the alternative is cheaper. They are well aware that most Americans would eat plutonium if it was coated with enough sugar.
I wonder what they will look like without the dyes. The middle of a butterfinger could be...brown? Tan? White?
[deleted]
>For example, annato from the seed of the fruit from the achiote tree will replace Red 40 and Yellow 5 in Butterfinger's crunchy center.

You could just, you know, leave it whatever color it winds up being.
thats right.  I want my fat to taste like a goddamed piece of whale blubber. same color too
So, it won't make my poop green anymore?
I wonder if this includes synthesized vanillin.
Something tells me this is just a ploy to cover the prices being jacked.
This is a product announcement, not news.
No more slave labor in 3rd world countries or sucking small communities water systems dry. I want that gone Nestle. Fuck your artificial flavors. 
The only logical conclusion, is that they discovered these substances actually ARE dangerous and are moving early to prevent blowback. The article sure works hard to ensure the reader knows how safe and fantastic these chemicals are.
I don't trust anything this company says.  What "food" company needs to employ 370 phD level scientists and spend 2 billion dollars on "food" development every year?  Caveat Emptor.
Those americans who want them gone do not buy nor eat those products. Just like those healthy shit Mcdonalds try to serve. People don't like those expensive premium crappy food.
A couple months ago, the FDA approved of allowing the term 'fructose' to include 10% of HFCS without needing it to be included in the ingredients.

So most people will be eating HFCS without even knowing it - a hidden treat brought to you by your friends in the FDA.
Came here to say this. Pretty sure Americans want real chocolate, too,  not the vomit-flavored palm kernel oil waxy crap. 
Agreed, real chocolate tastes awesome, and isn't overwhelmingly sweet, and does not make me feel like shit after eating it.
Real chocolate can be found everywhere. I've even bought real chocolate at Walmart. 

Most don't bother since its super expensive. Real coco beans are apt to disease, fake is much easier to make. 

I find the difference small enough that until they can cure these problems, when I eat a twix, I'm okay with it. I won't have a regular Hershey bar though, not a fan of the plain bitter taste.

Vote with your dollar.
Is Toblerone considered good chocolate? I like it. I bet it's made by the swiss.
[deleted]
So plutonium would be available in every corner drugstore?
Right. Only Americans like tasty things!
My guess is that they will be peanut butter colored.  I developed a recipe for home made butter fingers a few years ago and mine look like this http://i.imgur.com/5BmIwyh.jpg 

They may not be pretty but they are awfully good and some people can't tell the difference in flavor or texture to the nestle product.


How about you stop buying it and let other people make that decision for themselves.
Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge.
I want Nestle to own all American water interests so we can begin with the real Megacorps.
Coat it with chocolate, wrap it, and resell it.
I really need to ask you, have you ever tried to coat something with chocolate?


Have you ever melted a bar of dark chocolate, poured it over a strawberry and just watched the fucking thing turn white? Or get incredibly hard and gross? 



Have you ever thought a certain kind of candy just looked unappetizing?

Candy is really really hard to get right. 
Can you link to the federal register? How was that not news?
Then they can buy the Lindt bars that they sell in the candy aisle that already exist.

People act like there's no alternative when it exists, people just don't want to pay for it. 
Yeah, you can find Lindt chocolate bars everywhere, but they are super sized and more expensive. I will pay more for a real chocolate bar, but I'd prefer one that is normal sized for 1.50 instead of jumbo sized for twice that. 
It's owned by what is basically Kraft, and made in the US now.
Those are the most foulest little things I've ever seen
Easy for us to say here in a developed country with options.  Less easy when Nestle forces people in developed countries to buy their products because there's no alternative and all other ways of getting food have been bought out/ruined by Nestle.  See: all the babies who died in Africa because they convinced poor families to stop breastfeeding.
You should live in Africa where no alternatives exist, then say that. 
[deleted]
Yes, no, yes.
Lindt is butterfat disguised as chocolate. It melts *way* too easily and has no snap. Delicious butterfat it is, but a good example of European chocolate it ain't. 

If you want real chocolate, order it online. And not to be snarky, but there are a lot of really world-class, non-butyric-using chocolatiers in the U.S. and not just users of Belgian and Swiss imports like Peter's and Callebaut. [Scharffen-Berger comes to mind.](http://shop.scharffenberger.com/Chocolate-Bars/c/ScharffenBerger@Chocolate@Bars) 
[removed]
2015, these are the problems we have.
They didn't just convince families to stop breastfeeding, they gave free samples of just enough baby formula that the mother would stop producing her own milk, and have to keep buying formula
So fix the problem instead of taking away what I like.
So the only solution you can think of is to take away what I like? How simplistic for such a simple mind
Look out! There's another one!
Not all of it is. [These aren't](http://www.lindtusa.com/shop/90-cocoa-excellence-bar), which is the line you can get in the USA.
I'm not really defending the status quo here. People who want nice chocolate can definitely find it in the States with very little effort. It's not like damn near every supermarket and pharmacy doesn't already have a dedicated candy aisle where they sell bagged candy and those jumbo bars of Lindt instead of individual bars or anything. In most places, the only place you can buy bars is at the point of purchase unless it's like, a 7-Eleven . 

Not sure what Britain has to do with anything, as they crank out plenty of garbage, shitbox chocolate candy.
The poor and working class reward themselves with inexpensive food treats, because they can't afford anything else, so to dismiss this issue smacks of elitism. Not everyone can afford low carb blackberries mixed into organic Greek yogurt. For them, the occasional one dollar chocolate bar is an important part of their life, and it's perfectly reasonable to care about that.
  
Correct, but you have to convince the mother first to use the free samples of formula while you've got perfectly good breastmilk.  Not breastfeeding can be painful for the mom until the milk dries up.
No, in the case of Africa let's introduce alternatives if there is still an insistence of capitalism. If the alternative happens to be better, then Nestl√© will die out there.
You're a greedy piece of shit and you should commit suicide.
Touche, that's good chocolate. 

Edit: The end point here is that the American consumer doesn't like being told they can't buy something. British Cadbury's has a particular taste and that's what they want and *fuck both companies* for screwing us over with what is essentially a *MASSIVE* case of fraudulent advertising, since American Cadbury's is not, in fact, the real McCoy. 
[removed]
So the opposite is to only have expensive real chocolate. Fake chocolate makes it available to the poor.
There's no fraudulent advertising suit to be had here. Sorry. This isn't snark, either. There is literally no grounds for a false advertising suit.
The post I made before you accused me of defending the status quo stated that you can already buy nice chocolate in stores. I can seriously just walk into CVS or Rite-Aid right now and walk out with decent chocolate for like, $4. 

Niche chocolatiers have always been a rarity here. 
No, the feds should ban hfcs and place stiffer regulations on what is marketed as chocolate. The candy companies would squeal, but they'd comply and competition would keep the bars at a reasonable price point. 
Isn't it surprising how many people in this thread are just circlejerking bullshit without even knowing what they're talking about?
They should ban HFCS? What about small businesses that use it? Do you think there are any uses for it?

Do you know what the regulations are for chocolate labeling now are? They are super strict. 

How would more regulations and bans make prices cheaper than they are Now?
Not really That's kind of /r/news' M.O. 
Obligatory fuck Nestle
Please don't buy this shit from one of the world's most evil companies.
I'm one of those American weirdos that can't get enough Hershey bars.  Europeans and virtually everybody else on the planet seem to think they taste like chemical death, but I guess it's all in what you're used to.

And, obligatory fuck Nestl√© with a gympie gympie tree.

[Relevant cartoon](https://www.angryflower.com/247.html)
Break me off a piece of that...

Football cream?
I love kit Kats unfortunately I don‚Äôt buy from nestle anymore.
Really?  Give me a break!
Yeah, right. I avoid commercial chocolate as it is. Over priced, slave labor, not even close to being pure chocolate and now a seventeen dollar KitKat?!? Fat chance.
Fancy feast
Not sure if you are American or not but Kit Kats here are made by The Hershey Company. 

That of course makes this entire article irrelevant for most American as our only options are regular, white chocolate, and dark chocolate.
Same here...As a kid they were my favorite but I will not support them now.
What'd I miss out on here? Why is nestle the devil?
I get it!
Except at Japan at Epcot.
Since 2015 -- and as recently as January 2019 -- [Nestl√© has admitted that their Maggi Instant Noodles brand in India contains lead contamination up to 17x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggi#Maggi_noodles_safety_concerns_in_India).
They brainwashed mothers in Africa that their babies will die if they don‚Äôt drink powdered baby milk. Then after given them free samples for a while cut that and made them buy it at full price.
Also a large percentage of the cocoa beans they buy are cultivated by child slaves in africa.
Nestle themselves of course can not be bothered to source the origin of their cocoa beans.
They buy up water. Nestle believes no water should be free. They actually own a big chunk of flint, michigan's water...the city sold it to them while its citizens didnt have running water. Its an evil company for sure.
[deleted]
and they have to dilute it with unsafe water.  Killed as many as a million babies a year.

It is even more evil than that!


The practice of relying on free formula in maternity wards frequently means the mother loses the ability to make her own milk and must buy formula.
>Better to hate chocolate eaters

Yes, because instead of hating the people who did the thing, or those who signed off on the thing, or profited from the thing, hate those who buy from those who did the thing, clearly they are the **most** responsible.
Its not like there are disclaimers at the candy aisle, telling you that your purchase is contributing to human suffering.
Ah right. Thanks for this, I wasn't up to date. Soooo.. I guess we need to hate literally every corporation except for Ben & Jerry's now huh:)

>people still need chocolate...to survive

Who purchases chocolate, from Nestle, to eat, to survive? Even then, this is a greater reason not to Blake those eating it...

>It's not like Nestle is going to start bottling air and calling breathing a need. 

Breathing is a need...

Chocolate not being a need simply makes it worse, not better, that Nestle, or anyone, would destroy the environment to produce it.
All Nestle chocolate tastes like plastic.
This friendly "news" headline brought to you by your friends at Nestle.
I'm assuming they did this intentionally because this is Nestle 
Well of course they did it voluntarily: FDA cannot mandate a recall, only recommend one.
Nestle must have broken records for its never ending list of wrongdoings 
Oh noes! Plastic won't cause a sufficient blood sugar rush to trigger insulin shock!
Just in the US.  They have some pretty good chocolate in Europe. 
That only happens to gluttonous pigs.
Nestle is already on their way to fuck it.
There is water on the bottom of the ocean!
Soooo it's not freshwater ? Why would it need to be desalinated if it's freshwater? I'm confused
Calling it a "reservoir" is a tad misleading. There isn't a large body of underground water, it's water soaked rock basically.
This is neither news nor mysterious. There are many articles from reputable sources on the subject.
It is where the alien base gets their water.
What effects would we see if this body of water were added to the ocean water?
Hint: It isn‚Äôt Antarctica

So doesn't that mean it isn't freshwater?
"Mysterious." Of course it's "mysterious," they're peddling clickbait to the Pawnstars/Dog the Bounty Hunter crowd.

I wonder what kind of different types of life is in there. There have been sinkholes which opened and revealed life we never knew about. This could be an entirely different type of discovery.

Yep, let's find it and use it up, mess it up etc. Sigh...That 'awe' didn't last long...
Wait, isnt there a post on teddit where some vlogger goes and takes a photo next to the suitcase but, has no idea theres a body inside.
I think you mean 'suck it' (up into little marketable packages.)
I mean funny but it's not really practical for them. Its salinaized which means there would be much more effort to actually process it then just pumping it out of the ground like they do now.
.. and the days go by ..

It's just a little salty
An aquifer is the right word
Negative it's an aquifer.

Dead fish for a little while
Desalination can also be used as meaning to remove minerals. Not just salt (although it normally is used in that context).
Found the Nestle account.
It's not a lake. It's water that is trapped in porous rock and sediment. It's not something that you could travel through at any level.
nah, they're clearly gonna put their dick in it
Its fresh water in an aquafir.
into the blue again
So its good for making pasta?
You are correct, but as I replied elsewhere, I was trying to ELI5 because this is reddit.
> aquifer

And just what is an aquifer? Let's have a look:

aq¬∑ui¬∑fer  
/Àà√§kw…ôf…ôr,Ààakw…ôf…ôr/  
noun  
a body of permeable rock which can contain or transmit groundwater.  

So, water soaked rock like I said. My point is that the layman reads "reservoir" and thinks of the local reservoir that looks like a lake and thinks there is some large body of water in some cave underground which can't be farther from the truth.
They try to make it so in order to allow their audience the opportunity to imagine themselves more smarterer. Manipulators manipulate.
'Fox News' and 'science' shouldn't even be in the same web address.

Edit: exact quote is "Scientists also said that if the water was to ever be processed for consumption, it would need to be desalinated"
after the moneys gone
Mmmm, aquifer pasta
All I'm saying is if your gonna be anal about people using reservoir than you should be more concise than water soaked rock which makes less sense than reservoir.
But it's not a water soaked rock.

Anyone ever try a kitkat from outside the U.S.? They are fucking magical. I hate what the corn syrup industry has done to chocolate.
fucking Nestle, you can't trademark the concept of a rectangle
Good!

1) trademarks exists to prevent consumer confusion, not to give companies rights to simple and obvious designs.

2) [Fuck Nestle.](http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/nestle-california-bottled-water/)
gimme a friggin' break..
I'd never even seen an off-brand kitkat until this post got me curious enough to google it.
How can you have a whole article about Kitkat's shape without providing a picture of Kitkat's shape?
Can we please see that Delaware North Cos. Lose their trademark claims to Yosemite NP as well?!

http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-the-corporate-grab-yosemite-park-s-trademarks-20160119-column.html
I'm going to draw a single line segment and get it trademarked.  Then go about suing every company that uses a line segment in any of its designs.
So you could effectively create your own kitkat shaped chocolate bars with no repurcusions? So I can make the packaging the same red colour, and call it KittieKat, or something and this would be ok?

I could call my master umbrella company Nestle, as in.. how a mouse likes to *nestle* in its straw.

and this is ok?

Great, how much is it to start making chocolate bars?
Wasn't there a reason why our chocolate sucks?  a specific acid found in vomit ?

Same thing for Coke. Actual sugarcane coke is amazing. I want to go to Japan and try the plethora of flavors they have for KitKats.
They're using the Apple playbook I suppose.

Apparently, they do exist:  http://i.imgur.com/u0Dx6b7.jpg
Yep that shit. Commercialism at it's finest!
Orange fanta from the middle east is fucking spectacular. I dunno if it's the same elsewhere just remember that when I was over there it was amazing.
Well I don't think Apple specifically patents the shape (rectangle with curved corners). Instead they sneak around and break it up into so many smaller patents that together make the shape of iPhone 

Maybe nestle should try patenting each kit and each Kat, which in whole would make a kit Kat bar
I was surprised at this accuracy
IIRC they tried to patent a rounded rectangle. And anything that involved placing a lower case 'i' I front of something including suing a company that holds the trademark for Iwatch. 

Let's not forget they names their OS 'iOS' which was already a well established brand and OS made
By Cisco: Cisco IOS which still exists today. 
As first I thought Nestle doing a good thing in the interest of public health. Then I realized that they probably cut costs this way, which is probably their main interest. Maybe we can leave it as a win win situation.
Food companies have developed lots of new sweeteners to cut costs. Saccharine, Sucralose and Aspartame are brands many folks are familiar with.

The history and technology of artificial sweeteners is interesting. Some of these have raised health concerns but they're all still widely available, in the pink, blue and yellow packets you see upon tables in restaurants.

Saccharine (Sweet & Low) is the pink one. Aspartame (Nutrasweet) is the blue, and Sucralose (Splenda) is the yellow packet.
This sounds like an Idiocracy item. Super Sugar! Sugar¬≤. 

This also sounds like cancer waiting to happen.
>‚ÄúReducing sugar is the Holy Grail of food companies these days ‚Äî but does it work?‚Äù

I'm *very* skeptical that there won't be unintended negative consequences.  Nestle of all companies should know this, as they've invested heavily in microbiome research.  There's a tremendous amount of evidence that gut bacteria are critical to our health, both physical and mental.  And everything we eat impacts which bacteria thrive in our guts. 
As long as it doesn't give me the sharts like olestra. 
That and diet candy bars
So can you explain how each sweetener has it's health concern? and which one would be better to consume?
The thing with the majority of those artificial sweeteners is that they're more bitter than sweet and they are prone to unpleasant after tastes. They have still haven't made something which is a good substitute for natural sugar particularly are sweets and candy. 
> This also sounds like cancer waiting to happen.

I would tend to agree with you and would avoid it for at least a decade until real data begins to be collected.
Did you actually have that problem? Olestra was only really on the major markets for a few months, and people experiencing the dire side effects generally had to eat on the order of an entire bag or two of Olestra-fried potato chips. 

So were you a hungry hungry hippo?
and fat free water? 
Aspartame causes cancer in rats when ingested in huge quantities relative to their body weight. All of them are sweet enough that they're very good at triggering the pleasure centers of the brain. Not sure of any other particular concerns.

It's almost like I've actually researched this. Sweet things produce a pleasure response. Aspartame causes cancer at extremely high doses.
Great job at coming across as an ass hat. You were trying for that right?
I live in Northern CA, it's classified as "High Desert" here.  The area's biggest employer?  The water bottling plant.  What were the early town fathers thinking?  It's always been high desert here, who the fuck gives away what little water their population has in a fucking desert?  WTF?
Nestl√© water tastes like plastic. Arrowhead included. 
Please do not be the idiot who thinks that bottled water caused our drought. Be outraged at the plastic waste caused by bottled water. But please do not be part of the idiot majority who thinks closing down water bottling plants and letting your lawn go brown will save us from the wasteful farm practices. 
More government employees doing the jobs humans should be doing.  People love to downvote me and say it's one in one thousand but it's not.  They are pretty much all stupid.

When town fathers made these deals, nobody wanted to live in the desert. A town of 10,000 is a lot different than a city of 100,000 which  exists now. Bottled water is a diversion argument. Desert sprawl drains water.
We do our best but the problem is at the end of the day the government pays shit and hires lower end people than the private sector.  We could fire them all and hire back half and pay them more and be much better off.   I know downvote because people that work for the government are just the best!
Have you seen the way those guys act? It's honestly arguable.

Shit, even now people in certain dry states with heavy Agriculture already get killed over water.
Bottled water should be banned. There is no bigger waste of plastic at this point.
Hope BC receives 1,700mm (almost 6 feet) of precipitation. This, for the most part, falls upon the bedrock of the surrounding mountains. The aquifers (about one per mountain, perhaps more) extend vertically, over 1km (3,000+ feet), before emptying into the Fraser River via thousands of tiny springs. The already pure water takes about 10 years to being furthered cleaned and polished by traveling through several kilometers of sandy gravel. The District of Hope uses this with minimal (if any) chlorination, for its 6,000 citizens. Of which 600 are Nestle employees.

There is more than enough water to provide for Hope and Nestle. If it wasn't bottled, it would just flow into the Fraser. What's the big deal?
They're not exactly getting it for free... there are the political bribes that must be paid.... 
They've been doing this in Ontario for years too. It's the same fucking water that comes out of my parents' kitchen tap, just with unnecessary treatments and a shitty plastic bottle.
I did the math and It works out to be roughly 231 acre feet of water, I used that much on my almond orchard this month alone. Im with you guys in that its unfair that nestle doesn't have to pay, and I hate water bottles as much as the next guy, but 231 acre feet a year is nothing. I'm surprised the article didn't report this number in ounces in order to crest more outrage. 
Stephen Harper is a waste of water himself
200,000 gallons a day is basically nothing. 
Many public aquifers have fallen victim to this in the USA.

I have a hard time feeling rage over this issue. If there is a natural spring on your property and you tap it, bottle it, and sell the product to people willing to buy it then whats the problem? I have a well on my property and I don't pay for the water I use. How would that be any different?

People seem to have this attitude that the government is somehow inherently more trustworthy and thoughtful about how to use resources than the private sector.   

People should look at the government like a huge corporation that can force customers to pay them for services they don't use, and is even less accountable.   
They're all over the map, they've been exploiting the natural springs of NW Florida for years now...
Quoting the relevant part:

>Personally I believe it's better to give foodstuff a value (he's assuming water is a foodstuff here) so that we're all aware that it has it's price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there.

If water was privatized as he suggests, it would put a damper on Nestle's abuse of free water.  This guy states plainly to the world that water is valuable and people should charge for it, everyone ridicules him, then his company goes on to show exactly why water should be payed for.

Also, I'm not sure what his position is for the average person.  He seems to support the idea that everyone should be guaranteed access to water, but he's extremely vague on how this would happen.
Capitalist insanity, thy name is Nestle.
Agreed. It's one of the few things I refuse to buy. And I can get water for free from my faucet!
Have you ever been to Mexico? Or out camping for a long weekend? Or had pipes burst in your city causing the water to be shut off? Or been through a natural disaster where tap water isn't available?

Bottled water is great to have around.
>What's the big deal?

When that water makes it to the Fraser River, it circulates throughout the area, gets used by the town, or evaporates, and eventually makes it's way back into the ground, whether via rain or watering gardens, or whatever, thus replenishing the aquifers and restarting the process all over again.   The point is, normal use keeps that water in the local water system.  Bottling it up and selling it around the country *removes* that water from the local system.  The cycle will (eventually) be unable to continue because little by little there will be less water replenishing the source.

The big deal is this is just another excuse to drum up anti-corporate outrage.  Nestle actually takes less water than the farms or towns in the same area, and since it's free for the taking they aren't breaking any laws.
I calculated that it would take a catchment area of about 15 ha (37 acres) to supply their annual needs. 
Not particularly relevant in this case.  Hope BC will not run out of water. If anything, climate change will increase the amount it does have.
If you keep following it, the root is money in politics. Now that lobbyists have no limit on what they can "donate" to politicians they just buy the legislation and judges that they want.

The depressing thing to me is I can't see a way to change it without bloodshed. "Campaign finance reform" is something politicians wave their hands about from time to time but in the past 20 years it just continues to get worse.
*Normal use* includes sprinkling, flushing and washing. All of said water ends up in the Fraser. Does not get recycled.

Hope is about 20 miles from tidewater. Below it, nobody uses Fraser River water for drinking water. It does not get recirculated, but goes straight to the sea. Some might be used for irrigation if the farm is next to the river, because its easier to pump river water than groundwater, but not because it's more available. 

The water in the Hope aquifer originates in the mountains above, which receive incredible amounts of precip. Any water that Hope and Nestle don't use does not get recycled but gets flushed to the sea.

Think of the Hope aquifer as a very broad river, fed by a even huger river - the jetstream - flowing down 2 vertical kilometers and 10 horizontal kilometers of mountain side, underground through a gravel and sand layer, and into the sea. The point is, fresh clean water is the one thing that Hope has an overabundance of. Why you gotta bust their chops?

>The cycle will (eventually) be unable to continue because little by little there will be less water replenishing the source.

Oh, if only. Unfortunately, the amount of water is expected to increase.
It's rather like charging a company royalties for selling compressed air.
It shouldn't be theirs to take freely.  It belongs to the towns and the people who live there.  The article is trying to address how water should be treated as a public trust and protected as a valuable resource.

Nestle is actually in favor of promoting the proposed regulation.
Funny. They are moving north for a reason. There is your relevancy. BTW, flood water does not help a water shortage. 
> Normal use includes sprinkling, flushing and washing. All of said water ends up in the Fraser. Does not get recycled.

Sprinkling goes into the ground which makes it's way back to the aquifers if it doesn't get caught in a creek that feeds the Fraser.  

>Hope is about 20 miles from tidewater. Below it, nobody uses Fraser River water for drinking water. It does not get recirculated, but goes straight to the sea.

Okay, a fair point.  

>The water in the Hope aquifer originates in the mountains above, which receive incredible amounts of precip. Any water that Hope and Nestle don't use does not get recycled but gets flushed to the sea.

Understood.  Nestle is not pulling their water from the Fraser, though.  They're pulling it directly from the Aquifer, which lowers the water table that feeds everything else.  A problem will occur when an aquifer is drained faster than it is replenished, as once drained it is effectively emptied for good since it can take anywhere from decades to recharge to a thousand years.  The real question is:  Is Nestle emptying the aquifer faster than it is being recharged?
If it belongs to the town (there's only 1) and the people who live there, and if they decide to give it to Nestle in exchange for employment, would you be satisfied? 
Hope isn't moving north. The Nestle plant isn't moving north. Who is this "they"?

Flood water is not under discussion. We were discussing aquifers. 
>Sprinkling goes into the ground which makes it's way back to the aquifers if it doesn't get caught in a creek that feeds the Fraser. 

Not true. The aquifer is covered by a thick impervious layer of hardpan (called an aquitard - reddit should like that), from the last glacier passing through. Groundwater runs off to the Fraser, or flows through the overburden into the Fraser.

> A problem will occur when an aquifer is drained faster than it is replenished

Correct. Many municipalities in the region, including Hope, restrict sprinkling to every other day. This is mostly due to a tripling of demand for water for sprinkling. The water flows through the aquifer at a particular pace. If demand exceeds that pace, then the aquifer level would drop for a while in the area around the pump, and it would be harder to pump. But unless people are sprinkling 24/7, the aquifer levels return with a few hours.

 I guess you could say that it is more important that the grass be green than people be employed, but that would be your call.

>as once drained it is effectively emptied for good since it can take anywhere from decades to recharge to a thousand years. 

You're not paying attention. If there was a 10 year drought, then the aquifer would drain. Guaranteed. Even if there was no one using it. It's not level, but flows down a rather steep mountain slope. It's a river not a lake. It takes 10 years for precip on the mountainside to melt, enter the aquifer, and then seep into the Fraser.

If that's what they collectively agree, sure that's their prerogative.  But that's not what's happening.  Nestle is not promising to employ anyone in any kind of arrangement.  The 600 jobs in town from Nestle are a side effect.  Those jobs would still be there if the town began charging Nestle for the rights to pull from the aquifer. 
Climate change = flooding = not helping Aquifers   
Same topic
But that is exactly what happened. 600 jobs in a town of 6,000 people is hardly a side effect. Without Nestle, those jobs would disappear, and Hope would be more than decimated.
As far as Hope goes, climate change => increased precipitation which charges said Aquifers.
Nestle would have no incentive to leave.  They have a huge amount of resources invested in the plant & community, so they actually have an incentive to stay.  They haven't left the other parts of the country where they are charged to pull from aquifers, so your concern is unfounded.  If you actually read the article, a Nestle spokesperson said they were in favor of the proposed legislation, provided what they were being charged was fair. 
Agreed, but that's a matter between Hope and Nestle. If the people of Hope aren't bitching, then it's nobody else's concern. 

How much do you charge for something so plentiful? In this area of the world, it's like charging for air.
Some of them are bitching.  Their quotes are in the article.  
Yeah. One:

>‚ÄúWe have water that‚Äôs so clean and so pure, it‚Äôs amazing. And then they take it and sell it back to us in plastic bottles‚Äù 

 They're not taking "her" water. They're taking some of the water that nobody is using and soon would become seawater anyway.
I mean, they sell garbage as baby food superior to mother's milk and are hoarding water so they can monetize what should be a basic human right. They quietly benefit from the rampant child slavery on the Ivory Coast that produces 70% of the world's cocoa.  And yet they are still one of the largest food providers worldwide.  I doubt this will phase them.

"Well, you see, the fungus helps in infant development.  We're giving it to you at no extra charge!"
Actually I think the only time the word "fresh" should properly be used with Nestle is in conjunction with the word "trouble"

hey montreal, you can't get in the way of the huge profit in selling cold water.  would somebody *please* think of the corporations?

Because it can't be bothered to have a recycling diversion program that would prevent them from ending up in landfill...

And they want us to believe they're the environmental good guys here?

Oh, Montreal. You stay classy.
Oh um... You forgot the "/s" tag.
Reddit takes this very seriously you know. 
Hello, top-voted comment that is 100% misinformation.

That mechanism is for discriminatory policies, such as if Montreal decided to ban only foreign or out-of-province produced plastic water bottles.
This is about bottled water i.e. Dasani and Aquafina not CocaCola and Pepsi.
Can we just please collectively shit on a draconian policy without having to be finger-wagged at that we have it somewhat wrong?
Thanks for clarifying details of a secret deal that citizens haven't been allowed to see. Maybe if it were up for public debate I would have my facts straight, as opposed to relying on Wikileaks and espionage to find out what the New World Order has in store for us plebes.
Its all bullshit. Marlboro successfully sued Uruguay for implementing large health warnings on ALL cigarette packages by arguing that it was somehow a discriminatory action. WTO sided with Marlboro. The TPP will go even further.
You're kidding, right? The text of the deal has been available for months. It still hasn't been passed by the Senate.

But yeah, keep screaming about the secret trade deal that nobody knows the details of that is being crammed down our throats before we know what happened.
Obviously that's bullshit, but you said it yourself: it already happens under existing trade deals.

The TPP doesn't go further, you have nothing to back that up. This is a standard feature in trade deals that only recently has become controversial, because OMG CORPORATIONS.
The article states the Russians paid for the property. How does this work legally for the US to asume ownership of the property forcefully?
In a lot of countries you're not permitted to "buy" land unless you're a citizen. The article says they bought it, but we're unsure what the actual terms are. 

I'm guessing there's some fine print when dealing with an adversarial intelligence agency. "We have the right to kick you out if our relationship goes tits up"
Most likely the Russian government will keep ownership but will not have access to the property except for upkeep.  The US has to be careful, the Russians have all kinds of ways to make life very difficult for US diplomats (and spies).  Something they have already been reported to do. 
Legally I couldn't say but this definitely wouldn't be the first time the American government took land by force and I seriously doubt it will be the last.
I would assume eminent domain or some other act/legislation 
Yeah I know Mexico and UAE does that. I'm pretty sure you can own property in the USA though.

Stop buying bottled water
I'm sure the raw material is cheap but the bottles, the delivery and the marketing all cost money. People are paying for convenience. Walmart sell gallon jugs of water but you still see people grabbing all the 24 packs of bottles when a storm is on the way. 
Seriously, they're pumping water from our lakes and they pay us dick for it. Our legislature is an embarrassment.

*Edit to clarify:*

My argument is that as a resident of Michigan, we live in a state with the largest freshwater lake system in the world. In coming years as climate change continues to heat the earth, fresh water is going become a much scarcer commodity. Streams are going to dry up, deserts will spread, and the ocean will rise.

If you think that seems far fetched, then consider Lake Mead. Here is a graph showing how much water it has lost in the past decades.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-10/las-vegas-more-screwed-drought-drains-lake-mead-lowest-hoover-dam-built

Lake Mead has been steadily losing water due to it being an aquifer for Las Vegas, in addition to hydro power and year after year of droughts and below standard snow melt run off replenishment.

I think within a 100 years the deserts we have now will be much larger, streams and lakes will be shrinking, and Michigan will have one of the largest sources of fresh water on the globe.

Those are the reasons why I get angry when I see our legislature letting Nestle pump out our water for pennies. It's worth more than that, and it will be worth far more in future generations.

Comment I made in the past on Facebook regarding Nestle in Hope, BC. I realize the article mainly focused on America but people in BC really hate Nestle without knowing facts:

Nestl√© extracts about 265 million litres of water a year from a well in Hope, BC.

Agricultural water usage for the Fraser Valley is 25,400,000 cubic meters per day (which is 25,400,000,000 litres) [GeoJournal, Volume 40, 1996-10-01, issue 1-2, pp 135-146].

Let's do some math:
25,400,000,000 x 365 =
9, 271, 000,000, 000 litres used per year by agriculture. Over 9 trillion.

265, 000, 000 / 9, 271, 000,000, 000 = 0.00005%

Nestle uses 0.00005% of the water that agriculture does a year.

Oh, and if you guys are concerned about Nestle drying up our water:
the amount of water discharge at the mouth of the Fraser River is an average of 3,475 cubic metres per second. (winter flow rates are ten times higher than summer). That works out to 300,240,000,000 litres per day. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_River#Discharge) 

Why should nestle be charged for making use of water that would flow out to sea anyways?

To top it all off, we pay more for our water because we get it treated by the government and transported to tap. Nestle does not pay the government for treating the water they take. They use their own filters and purifiers. In addition, they also pay for their own transportation, logistics, quality control and other overhead expenses. There are a lot of factors at play for why the prices are different.

Going after Nestl√© is like trying to save pennies while agriculture is literally hemoraging $100 bills. 
Do you think that's water you're paying for now?

Most of what you pay for bottled water or soft drinks is not for the content anyway.

It's the bottle and label, transportation, employees, machines, filters, quality control, chemical/bio tests, advertising, etc.

If you don't want to pay for that, you can get free water from the nearest pond, river, or almost free from a faucet.
[deleted]
On the other hand, Nestle or any other company isn't going to bottle and transport your water for free. And nor should they. 

They make money off of convenience. Since water is a basic right, you should be able to drink it from your tap. If you can't, that's the fault of your government/municipality. 

Perhaps Nestle can reduce the price of their bottled water products, but I don't know what their margins are, perhaps they're making a minimal profit already or maybe not. They're still just selling it at what people are paying. So then the argument is Nestle should give the water for free/discounted to Flint citizens. Which they have no obligation to do whatsoever. 

The main issue here is with the government not providing its citizens usable water. It's not a company's responsibility to fix that issue. So while I won't go pro-nestle, or gain any appreciation for them, I'm not going to misdirect my hate to them. 


[removed]
This is where all the economics experts hang out, right?
Other than for the bottle, the bottling factories, the fuel costs, the labor costs, the logistics, and the transportation costs. Having cold bottled water at basically every corner on earth for you when you're thirsty or hot is not free, and certainly I can imagine the most value comes from that convenience, not that it's actually something much better than tap water coming from a typical aquifer. 

Let's be real, nobody expects the actual contents of a drink are the significant part of the cost.  
[deleted]
You guys understand that you're not paying for the water, right?
You're paying for a bottle and the convenience.
Is someone stopping you from going to the stream and collecting the water yourself?
I save thousands bottling water I pay nearly nothing for.
I remember just the other day I saw someone at the store with a gun to their head being forced to buy nestle water. Was terrible.
Folks have no perception.  Thr total volume used by Nestle wouldn't be even 3 seconds of flow over Niagara Falls.

I never buy bottled water (we have the best water in the world in Calgary) but the idea of Nestle using up some resource is silly.  One farmer would use ten times the volume of Nestle's bottled water on 500 acres of soya beans.

The  resl issue is in the ecological impact of  plastics, transport, energy, waste, etc.
[deleted]
Nestle uses about 350 million gallons per year. The city of LA uses about 10 billion gallons a month. A 1/2 inch rainstorm over a city the size of LA drops roughly 4 billion gallons of water. The amount of water that Nestle actually uses is such a small amount that the difference that it makes is almost none. Sure Nestle has some poor business practices, but water conservation efforts of the citizens of CA will save FAR more, and already has saved more water in a year than Nestle uses in over 10 years. If you are going to be outraged about shit Nestle does there are better things to be outraged about. The amount of water they use is practically nothing.
If I could make billions off of something that costs me very little, I would as well.
TIL people didn't know bottled water is a rip off. 
I really don't get why people like to complain about shit like this.

If they are doing it then they're the smart ones in this picture.

Don't want them to do it? Don't buy the fucking overpriced water and if they want to buy water from you don't sell it to them for nothing.
Capitalism is fucking horrible we should all just starve and live in mud huts. 
How the fuck is this news?
Bottling process doesn't just magically happen for free, feel free to go bottle it yourself 
I don't like nestle as a company, but you can't have every single person go to a spring and get their own water. Because that's the only alternative and it would not work.
You can't just bottle water and disperse it for free. You have to pay for the plastic, the transportation, the storage.
You're also paying the government for water when the government paid nothing to pull it from the earth. How is it any different?
This is news? 
Why is this in r/news

One of the many reasons I will actually go out of my way to not buy anything from Nestle.  That company is the definition of evil corporation.  It is difficult to not buy anything from them since they own so many other companies but I do everything I can to keep from purchasing their products.
Here's a shocking solution- don't buy their product. Poof, no more billions made in bottled water. You save money and it's more environmentally friendly.
*77 million Americans are served by water systems that violate testing requirements or rules about contamination in drinking water, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. In agriculture-heavy regions, pesticides, fertilizers, and nitrates from animal waste leach into the ground. Despite the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, compliance with harmful chemical restrictions isn‚Äôt monitored carefully, and most wastewater-treatment systems aren‚Äôt designed to remove hormones, antidepressants, and other drugs. The Trump administration‚Äôs Environmental Protection Agency is also attempting to roll back existing regulations.* 



*A recent Michigan State University study predicts that more than a third of Americans might not be able to afford their water bills in five years, with costs expected to triple as World War II-era construction breaks down.*


Removing more regulations doesn't seem like the way to go here.

I drink bottled water because i prefer it to my local water. Local water is fine i just prefer the bottled. If the local water is not up to minimum standards, the state/federal government should punish them or step in to help. It is not a private industry's responsibility to provide clean water for the citizenry it is the government's. bottled water is a preferential service provided by a private industry for those who have a desire for such service, if you don't like it don't use it.
Nestle is one of those terrible companies that are embedded into our culture as wholesome and family oriented
BP makes billions barreling oil it pays nearly nothing for. Apple makes billions packaging iPhones it pays nearly nothing for. 
And that is the company that will exchange servitude for water in the future. 
So has Niagara! I worked there last year before I started college. I couldn't help but be pissed off when I realized they had a fucking City tap water line running right up to the bottling line. Yes they deliver spring water once every couple of months (which is watered down with city water), but honestly they are making a fortune by taking tap water, filtering it and throwing in some mineral packets (which I have seen them neglect). I've never worked for a worse, money hungry, greedy company in my life!

Not news really. I guess it could be a TIL, but this is known knowledge.
And farmers make ***trillions*** from water they pay nearly nothing for.  So?..
Ok go start a bottled water company and make cheaper bottled water then.
Alright, so this is interesting. I'm not an expert and a lot of this is from old memory. 

My understanding is as follows, the reason that Nestle does not pay a significant amount for public water is that they would be willing to pay more to purchase more. Nestle pays the same amount per gallon as you do, which is minimal. This allows government to limit how much water they take as it can be treated like a resource, and not a commodity. This actually prevents companies from simply purchasing ALL of the water, something that they really would not mind doing even if at a significantly higher price.

Why they can't raise price AND limit usage, I'm not 100% but I feel like it has something to do with the legality of it. IIRC it would end up raising the price for the public as well, since they would have to match the price set by Nestle. 

I don't know, maybe I'm talking out of my ass here.

Tl;dr: cheap costs limit how much of the resource can be purchased.
How many people do they employ? How much taxes do they pay to build roads, hospitals, gov facilities? How much money do they invest to other people's businesses so they can grow?

Alternate title: People pay Nestl√© billions for water it pays nearly nothing for

Seriously Nestl√© provides a product to people who want it. If you could make billions off people who won't drink tap water, so would you.

Edit: while I do agree there are predatory companies, in this instance everyone knows what they are buying, and yet they still do. Save your internet outrage for companies that business models are entirely dependent on fucking people over
And the government lets them. 

We should give the government more power and more money, that will fix the issue. Why people want these con-men to be in charge of the health issues is beyond me. 
"Daily, we‚Äôre looking at 3.5 million bottles."

Many of which will end up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsJqMmuFWO4).
This is why I buy gallon jugs and drink it throughout the day
Just because the water is pennies doesn't mean that Nestle doesn't spend any money on processing, packaging, safety testing, production, distribution, advertising and marketing.

They probably have at least a dime in each bottle.
This ain't news, unfortunately
who cares this is corporate america... they can do whatever they want... if you dont like it dont buy it...
ITT: Apparently Nestle products is the only way to get water
Why just Nestle? Aren‚Äôt all bottled water companies guilty of this?
ok.. then start charging them more. i don't see what exactly is the problem here

It's always been common knowledge that the concept of bottled water is a fucking joke. It's also common knowledge that Nestle is a garbage company. Where's the news?

EDIT: A lot of people aren't getting the point. If you have access to drinkable water and you choose to still purchase bottled water, **you are the reason these companies get away with this.** I don't care how you justify it. People like you are the cause and it 100% hurts the people who actually need it to survive.
BREAKING NEWS: "Capitalism still exists in America"
I'm confused. How did they "take" the water?
[removed]
How much "huge profits" could possibly be in a case of water that retails for like $3.50?  Is it more than that in MI?  I've always been amazed at how cheap bottled water can be, even if the water is free.  They extract the water, pour it into a plastic bottle (which costs very little, but costs something), label it, load it onto a pallet.  Nestle adds their profit and sells to a Walmart or Meijer or whoever.  There is a cost of shipping from the plant to a distribution center where it accrues some degree of storage and labor costs.  More shipping costs to ship to a grocery store where the grocer adds enough to cover their own store costs and some profit, and still the retail unit cost only comes to like $.10-$.14/bottle.  That's crazy to me.
People can stop buying it if they want. 
I'd be interested to see how many pence per litre/bottle it is estimated their materials (packaging + ingredients) are. I've not read the article, but wondering if it's stated? 
Alternative headline: Consumers spend billions on Nestle bottled water that they could get from the tap for nearly nothing.
Get out of here with your logic. We need to get riled up and blindly hate one company. 
People would like Nestle to pay something significant for water. Say 10 cents a litre or 40 cents per gallon. 

People don't consider that if that was the case, other companies would have to pay it too. Kilogram of beef takes 10000 litres of water to produce. Now a pound of beef costs 500 dollars in water. 

Washing a car on your own yard is 30 dollars.
And liquor too.
Or any other company for that matter. Just replace "nestl√©" with "apple", and "bottling water" with "making phones" and you get an equally valid sentence.
Well our city purchase water from a wholesaler at $800 an acre-foot, which is what, .2 cents a gallon?
That‚Äôs actually quite an offer. Most groundwater is free. Treated water in my Florida city sells for $1.25 a thousand. 
That's a lot higher than a lot of water use agreements, I think.
[deleted]
Made up story
ITT people not understanding how many gallons of water are in even a small sized spring. .5¬¢ per gallon could easily be 10s of thousands of dollars. 
What did residential users pay a gallon?
that's retarded. That's roughly how much you would charge any normal resident or company for a gallon of water
They don‚Äôt get spring water from municipalities so that is most likely not accurate. Municipalities usually  provide city water which is used to make purified water not spring water.
How did you deny them the right to use public water?
So does this mean that at one point Flint's municipality agreed to sell to Nestle? Does the city not take any responsibility?
Please this.  Way too many cool reusable bottles available to justify buying any more bottled water.


NO! i need it to LIVE!
Is US tapwater really that bad? Like, how is that possible in 2017 lmao
Tap water is just not good enough for some people.
Stop telling others what to do when you don't know everyone's situation. I live in an area with god-awful tap water that tastes like public swimming pool, the kind that makes you even thirstier. Installing a filter is not an option for me at the moment, so I buy bottled water. It's purified to higher standards with most of the foul-tasting minerals removed, so it actually tastes like pure water. Many other people live in locations with highly mineralized water supplies. Water treatment in those places makes the water safe to use for most household purposes, but it's still not the best for drinking. 

While "fuck nestle" seems to be the kneejerk response to anything Nestle-related here, it's important to keep things in perspective. The demand for water is extremely inelastic and certainly isn't going anywhere, so if it wasn't Nestle depleting our aquifers, it would've been the cities. Water extraction needs to be carefully regulated by the government, but demanding that everyone give up on bottled water at once makes no sense. 
Not everyone has potable tap water.
This is absolutely correct. Any products raw materials is going to cost pennies in the dollar, yet people are willing to buy the finished good. Why? Because production has value-add: safety, packaging, distribution, etc. 
My room mate is a bit of a spaz and she freaked out about the possibility of a hurricane coming... bought 4-6 cases of fucking Fiji water and then tried to split the $120 it with us.  That got a hard no.  Went to Costco and got 40 bottles of water for $3 and then went to the grocery store and got a few three gallon jugs for $1.25.  
Too bad this will never be a higher comment.  Complaining about a company that serves market demands is pretty ridiculous.  I don't seen any Americans walking to their local river an hour each way to fill up a jug of water.  As they comfortably drink bottled water provided by their uber driver before being given bottled water at a conference about gender acceptence while people in other countries die from not having treated water.  
we pay for the convenience of it? its legal to fill up your own plastic bottles from the tap 
If only we could do something about it, like.......not buy it. Not only could we stop buying it, but we could start giving feedback to businesses in our neighborhoods, giving friends and family shit for buying bottled water, etc.

While there's an increasing trend towards removing fountains, it's not hard to carry a water bottle, and they make 'em down to some pretty small sizes that will go in virtually any bag, or aren't a pain at all to carry.

If you don't want to spend a lot of $, hit up your local thrift store. You don't always see them around, but I've scored some pretty sweet stainless steel ones before for under $5.

Oh, and for the same cost as one or two of those 2-3 gallon bottles - the kind you see people buying and bringing to special events like picnics and such - you can get a collapsable reusable bladder with spigot that will last a decade.
I would defer and say people are just fucking stupid and will pay 89 cents to a 1.50 to drink water in a bottle because it says "natural spring" or "smart water". The reason they can make money is because people are too stupid to just buy a damn filter and put water from their sink in it (which they pay for anyway!)
The mystery is why we're paying dick for water.
Lake Mead is a manmade reservoir in the middle of the desert.  The Great Lakes are not.  Get the bullshit comparisons out of here and quit being ridiculous.
Thank you for the sanity post in the sea of retardedness that is this thread
Chill with the facts man! Nobody wants to hear it. They wanna hate on big companies because they are bad.
The entire article is not devoted to attacking Nestle itself. 

"There‚Äôs also the issue of scarcity. The United Nations¬†expects that 1.8 billion people will live in places with¬†dire water shortages by 2025, and two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population could be living under stressed water conditions. Supply may be compromised in the U.S., too. A recent Michigan State University¬†study predicts¬†that more than a third of Americans might not be able to afford their water bills in five years, with costs expected to triple as World War II-era construction breaks down."

The fact that water scarcity exists is a fact of supply and demand. But it is ethical to take advantage of this? They mention a former CEO stating that everyone should have access to 30 L per day, only paying for additional use. 

Or the section about Lahore, Pakistan. Essentially, Nestle made tap water seem unsafe and of lesser quality. It seems to me that the tactics and system in place are what should be questioned. 

> 
> 
> 
> 
> Why should nestle be charged for making use of water that would flow out to sea anyways?

Right?

The worst is when I read articles that imply the county or municipality or some other source is entitled to some sort of compensation for the water.

1. The government makes money on every sale, every dollar made of profit, every income from person employed by Nestle bottling water
2. What difference does it make if the water hits the ground or is caught via rainwater traps? The land isn't doing any work to collect the water up for Nestle. Or refrigerating it.  Or purifying it.

It is such nonsense. It was doubly bad with the Chiappas story a few days ago with the Coca Cola plant. The amount of water Coca Cola was using amounted to a floating point precision error, but it was blamed for drying up wells all over the district despite the Mexican government admitting an earthquake likely radically changed the aquifer shortly before the wells drying up and that they were too cheap to do any research to figure out the impact. This and Coca Cola having been there for 25 years without any impact before.


3 Nestle/Coke water use stories in the past few days. It's asinine.
Like I get Nestle has done some horrible things, but the fact that Redditors can't even do the math and get outraged over this is baffling. Nestle is legit a drop in the ocean. That's why the pay fuck all for water, they assume the costs of treating and extracting the water and they create jobs too. 

No one wants to take on the real problem, which is farming... It's like that joke of people giving shit to rich women wearing pelts because it's easier than doing that to biker gangs with their leather jackets, or something along those lines.
With everything you have stated in mind, I still have two concerns with bottled water on general.

First, plastic is wasteful and in many cases ends up thrown away. Hopefully in a landfill or recycling facility, and worst case it is tossed and pollutes the local environment eventually breaking down in rivers, lakes, and oceans into tiny little pieces that get everywhere. Including your tap water.

Second, this may not be true for all places, and in reality as you demonstrated the amounts are often extremely small. However in some areas the water is drawn from very large aquifers that don't necessarily have a destination of the ocean. Removing noticable amounts of water from said aquifers and allowing it to be consumed somewhere else is concerning. If it's consumed inside the aquifer it was drawn from then the concern is less. In the end of course, the numbers that are drawn is very very small, as you've demonstrated, so the overall concern is questionable by comparison to other threats to your freshwater systems.
My favorite was the criticism of ice-bucket-challenge for wasting water.

You eat hundreds if not thousands of gallons of water every day. One pound of beef is like a thousand gallons. Handful of nuts is like a hundred. People have no clue how much water is required to grow food.

That bucket is <.1% of your daily water usage.
"Corporation buys raw materials, sell finished goods at a profit"
And it's not like they are gauging us on the prices.  A 24 pack of water is only $3.
Fair point.

Also I suspect the reason local municipalities charge such a small "extraction fee" for siphoning off all that water is in consideration of the fact that Nestle agrees to build a factory and add jobs to the local economy. That community may only get a small amount of money for the actual water, but if we're talking about a factory with "ten production lines" running 24/7, with "As many as 175 trucks" arriving every day to transport the finished product -- that's a lot of money being pumped into the economy in the form of jobs.
Starbucks is 99% water and they charge FAR more than nestle for it. Are they an "evil corporation"?
This should be higher up!
I think I spend maybe $200 a year on water filters. I literally never buy water I just filter tap water. 
Nestle doesn't pay their employees gas in their personal cars but they make billions in profit?!?!

For real tho that's what it feels like people are saying when they only look at one source of it
Good to see someone sane 
Next stop: privatized air supply.

Oh wait, that's already a thing in China!
Actually, maybe you should *actually* listen to or read what he said. You're mostly contradicting him, actually.

What he actually said boils  down to; Water *is* a basic right, but you don't have the right to *infinite* water. Everyone should be given a certain amount of water use allowance a day, for things like cooking,  cleaning, laundry, bathing, drinking etc. Again, this would be *free*, a *right* up until a point. After a certain limit, you'd have to start paying. His reasoning being that you don't *need* a swimming pool, you don't have the *right* to have water for a swimming pool like you do to drink. So excess water, like for recreation or your grass, would cost money, but you'd have an allowance of water to do basic needs for free.

Personally, I agree with this. I think it might help with water waste, as the price of excess/recreation etc water would undoubtedly be a lot higher than normal water prices now.

Ninja edit; actually.
Doesn't consider bottled water a public right, there's a difference.
Hate Nestle all you want, but stop spreading this falsehood. He believes that having access to drinking water is a human right, however having a right to water your lawn or fill up your pool is a completely different things and should be regulated more.
>listen to Nestles' CEO, he doesn't consider water a public right. He wants to privatize it. Don't expect government help on this matter.

Wrong. He said he considers water a human right, but there's too much waste regarding it and that there should be some form of market mechanism to distribute it for maximum efficiency. 

I wish people would do research on this instead of spreading this debunked bullshit.
Commodities are not rights.
He never said that. However even if he did he's not wrong. Why is anyone entitled to the fruits of someone else's labor? Someone works hard to clean, process, and bottle water and now it should be free? You're stupid if you think that we should enslave people. 
> Don't expect government help on this matter.

You Americans should probably stop electing politicians who are for sale to the highest bidder.
Also not the current CEO. That man hasn't been CEO since 2008... And that comment was made in 2005. A 12 year old comment by a man who is no longer with the company. 
It's public only on that your drinking and hygiene is all that is needed by fresh water. That's all it should be free for, anything else is a luxury not a right.
No defense of Nestle but I own the water under my land. I have what you may call privatized water. If I bottled what I pumped from my well and made mad profit would that be a bad thing?
[deleted]
This thread is absolutely hilarious.
"Nestle sucking dry millions of gallons of water."

Bruh, every state is using trillions of gallons of water on other random stuff people don't really need. Stuff that adds less convenience than all the bottled water together. Nobody is going thirsty because of this.
Yeah it's pretty odd that Nestle is picked out specifically for this smear.
Clearly the solution is a socialist planned economy. This would never result in situations like Flint. They just result in mass famine killing millions of people.
Because Reddit needs its pet nemeses.
It is stigmatized in Portland, Oregon, most people use refillable water bottles here, not all, but most. Seattle has similar awareness of the issue.
Are they really any different from the next big corporation? Coke is similar and also owns many food brands. I would imagine Pepsi, P&G, etc aren't much different either.

And then there's Monsanto, even if you're just buying fruits and vegetables at a farmers market you might be supporting them.

Here's a chart of which brands are owned by who. Kinda amazing how many are controlled by a fairly small group of companies

https://imgur.com/pnMMj

Edit: And Im not saying I think what they do is ok, just that it is a side effect of being a publicly traded company with share holders who expect growth year over year, combined with politicians who need money to be re elected. I dont have a good solution. Being careful to buy from more ethical companies is one option, but my point is that is quite difficult. Though not buying bottled water if your tap water is safe to drink is an easy first step (and that would probably mean most people in the developed world)
I mean should Nestle pay more for the water or what? Water is one of their products, they obtain it and then sell it at a higher value, this is literally just business and what every company does. what are they supposed to do, sell their water bottles for 10 cents each? What about coca cola? Or all the other companies who make bottle water? 
Your standard of evil is laughably low. 
Which brand is that?

The 32-40 packs I buy at Sam's Club usually average out to a little over a dollar a gallon.
And then the ultra wealthy will buy their way into the government. 
Yes, let's give more power to the type of entities that have been responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths. 
Nestle's putting amnesia powder in the water it's taking and only the people who **don't** drink their bottled water remember what they're up to 

thank you titfortitt
[deleted]
Fed govt isn't responsible for controlling the  free market to this extent (i.e. The price of privately provided water in The flint case in particular) ..  The whole idea of utilities is that they are a basic requirement for modern standard of living thus they are heavily regulated despite often being private companies.  The failure in Flint is to appropriately regulate and subsequently failure to take responsibility for failing to regulatr appropriately. 

Nestl√© as a private company has no obligation to the citizens of flint Michigan.  The city of flint is responsible. Then the state of Michigan is responsible for holding flint accountable. THEN the federal govt has a precedent but not responsibility to support the municipality 
[deleted]
Blame the government for fucking up the water in Flint, not for preventing Nestl√© from ‚Äúover charging‚Äú

If it wasn‚Äôt for Nestl√© and others, those people wouldn‚Äôt have any water at all
I feel somehow this comment comes from somewhere that has decent drinking tapwater.
In the us bottled water isn't needed.. but I just traveled to Asia and you're required to drink bottled water if you don't want to get sick. Only costs 5-10 cents a bottle there tho. Big problem with recycling them. Was sad to see landfills of plastic bottles on beautiful islands.
The quality of trash and the size of the pile make it unique among trash heaps. 
"WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE OUTRAGED AT OBVIOUS THINGS IN RETROSPECT"

*cracks open a crisp Fiji*
If the tap wasn't so shit in quality I wouldn't need to buy filtered drinking water. The idea the problem isn't more nuanced, and that as a consumer I should sacrifice my health to stick it to Nestle is asinine. We all need to survive. 
Jesus H Christ. Water is cheap. Pumping it, filtering it, bottling it, freighting it, selling it to retailers? That all costs money. Reddit, the place where no one knows how the basic business model of wholesale to retail works, ever. 
That it isn't common knowledge.
It‚Äôs common for people that look this sort of corporate malfeasance up, but come on... we‚Äôre talking about Detroit. They are too busy worrying about their politicians fucking them to think about corporations. 
> It's always been common knowledge that the concept of bottled water is a fucking joke.

Yes and no, to the "fucking joke" part. While I agree the way things are handled in terms of water bottle waste generation, and how companies like Nestle get water and profit from it are a disgrace and yes a really bad fucking joke there are perfectly valid uses for the products in very specific situations. That is, those bottles are a great way to store and portion out clean and safe water for emergency supplies etc. when the installment and use of large scale infrastructure to do so may not be possible or appropriate, or may take a prolonged period of time to get back up and running. 

As for use outside of that, while in the western world tap water is made potable and safe to consume at municipal water purification plants... sans situations like Flint and said water while generally safe may still not be of the best quality, flavor etc. The tap water in many southern California neighborhoods as an example to me tastes and smells horrid.(in the worst areas the brita filters did nothing to help that) This in turn represents a window of economic opportunity for purified water and bottle sales alongside household water purification system sales. In many developing nations those municipal supplies may not be all that safe even during times of normal operation... let alone during emergencies.

Personally I Keep around 5 cases of water on hand for sake of emergencies as I live in a seismically active area with severe winters that have been known to cause service disruptions. Outside of that I use my own extruded carbon block and RO filtration system to get rid of certain volatile organic compounds that persist in the municipal supply.
This exactly. How you can support these companies but complain when they succeed like this? I agree tap water on its own isn't great...but a Brita filter, it's a simpler fix, and way cheaper/more efficient overall. 
Amazing, I got some of the angriest comments when I mentioned that companies like Nestle and Coke just take Municipal Water bottle it charge ridiculous amount for it and sell it to the public.

People seem to love their bottled water, but the reality is the water coming out of your tap is usually better and doesn't cost anything comparatively. 

But hey I guess some people just want to spend dollar fifty on a half liter of water.
To reddit thats common knowledge. Take your average Joe and he probably thinks Nestle only makes chocolate bars.
Basically.  Cue "but it's crony capitalism!"
Because the companies are paying the politicians to give them these contracts.  Nowhere is there any recourse for regular citizens to have a say in what happens to any of our natural resources.  
Because water is dirt cheap in those areas. There are lots of industries that use water, and vast quantities of water, to produce their finished products. (A pair of jeans, for example, require 2,900 gallons of water to produce.)

But when you are done with the water, you get a pair of jeans. Here, Nestle is using the water.... to make water.

People get upset about that. But Nestle isn't getting the water on more favorable terms than Levi's -- they are just adding less value (or are less obviously adding value) to the water.
Because Nestle building a factory in the city provides tax revenue and jobs. The water is basically worthless, provides 0 jobs, 0 tax revenue, unless someone invest in the infrastructure to develop it and bottle it. Water resource is actually quite abundant in a lot areas of the US, so the city need Nestle more than Nestle need their water.

Sure, there's going to be a significant minority of people that doesn't want Nestle coming to their city. But majority of the people there probably do want Nestle because they want jobs. This is why the elected officials give out these contracts.
Fresh water is practically worthless at its source. The cost is in the water system itself. 
Considering how many "bottled water" companies there are, sufficiently huge profits.
People have safe,, clean, easily transportable drinking water available to them for a very low cost and apparently it's bad that someone makes a profit off of it.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs about 1-2 cents per case profit after its all said and done. Two things you should never ship are water and air.
My tap water is perfectly fine to drink (Dublin) but it tastes horrible and chemical. So I buy bottled water
There aren't many companies quite as nefarious as ole Nestle'.
They're the Comcast of the water industry!
"Omg Apple is pulling minerals out of the ground and refining them to make them into phones and then literally selling them back to us for a thousand dollars each WTF!"
1 acre-foot = 325850.943 us liquid gallons

1 acre-foot for $800 is $0.0024551102802/gallon 
An acre-foot is a real measurement? Fuck me.
[deleted]
How do you measure a liquid in acre-feet? Ive never heard of that before
That's a lot higher than most homeowners pay even today. About twice as much in fact.
I feel like a lot of top comments on popular Reddit posts are people making stories up to fit the narrative. They get a lot of Karma and bash the target harder. Win-Win in their eyes.
In NJ the water tastes like shit. In DC, where I grew up, we drank right from the faucet. In MD it was ok, but we filtered it. 

In NJ even after filtering, it just tastes weird. This is the only place I've ever bought bottled water. I feel stupid doing it, but if I don't everything tastes off. Coffee, tea, you name it. 
> Way too many cool reusable bottles available to justify buying any more bottled water.

So much this! Ever since I have a reusable stainless steel water bottle on my side, (about 0.7 liter), I almost never have to buy water when I am outside. 

People go on and on in this thread about the price being so high because people are willing to pay for convenience. It's even more convenient when I don't even have to go into a store to drink, I can just reach for the bottle I have.
Unless your water tastes like shit. I'm blessed enough to grow up in Washington, best water ever.
Honest question, why can't you buy one of those $20 water bottles with a brita filter in it? not trying to antagonize it's just hard for me to understand why anyone would need to pay money for water when you already have to pay for tap
His point was.. people pay $1 for it because it's worth it.

They pay for the bottle, the refrigeration, the transportation, and the infrastructure.

If it's such a rip-off, stop buying it and use your own. If you can't do that then you have no right to complain. If you do that but you're mad at others.. realize that everyone is allowed to make their own decisions on what to buy.

None of this is Nestle's fault.
Why do you assume that if you don't buy bottled water it needs to be tap water? Many supermarkets have water dispensers for like 25 cents a gallon or so. I usually see Glacier.

Edit: This is in the US of course, I don't know about other countries.

And of course, you would still be paying extra monies, but this is still much much cheaper than buying bottled water.
Exactly. Another thing is that reusable bottles get dirty and washing it is a pain in the ass. I'd rather pay 5$ for a pack of 24 than have to wash a reusable bottle 24 times.
Exactly. It‚Äôs not like fresh water in Michigan is a zero sum game, people are still able to get as much freshwater for free out of the tap as they want. You pay for the convenience of the bottle, not necessarily the water inside. If there is ever an instance where sourcing of water means the people of that area get less then there is news, otherwise thankfully in this part of the country water is plentiful
It's so easy to hate on Nestle. Sure there are a couple questionable instances that we should call them out for but for the most part they are doing nothing wrong.  Reddit has no fucking clue how water sourcing works globally and how the bottling industry is structured.
You pay costs of transporting the water 
No one ever pays me in dicks =/
Agreed, a little common sense is welcome
Wow, it's almost as if they want to make money at our expense.
You cannot trust tap water where I live. Bottled water is really convenient. I don't know why this thread is going bonkers.
I mean, water is pretty cheap to begin with. Think about your water bill and how cheap water is, its about $2 per 1000 gallons. This includes pay for the infrastructure and utility company to get the water to you. If Nestle extracts the water themselves, the cost goes way lower. 
Plus, "normal" citizens operating a pump for their own usage typically don't pay much either. If they pay at all. 

In most cases you don't really pay for the water from your tap. You pay for the transportation of that water to your house. Quality control and - that's usually the most expensive part - the disposal of used water. Cleaning water from the sewers before dumping it in the next river has helped a lot with making said rivers clean again. 
Good point too; they create jobs and wealth from water.

Besides, if they manage to sell water for whatever they sell it for, it's because people are buying it. Too many people don't understand that the price of things is whatever consumers are willing to pay. It is not "cost plus what I think is fair for the seller to get as profit". 
The fact that this post gets nearly 50k karma shows how retarded people on reddit are. They are like zombies for sensationalist headlines
[deleted]
It's like the lorax movie come true
I'm totally fine with that... Buuuut I also don't want water to be privatized. Free basic water and higher excess water prices, and the money doesn't go to a company making profit. It goes back into the infrastructure, and any excess is re-distributed to other, similar areas.
If only they got off reddit and got jobs in the water industry, clearly all problems would be solved overnight.
So you're agreeing with my incredibly sarcastic remark? 
> Are they really any different from the next big corporation? Coke is similar and also owns many food brands. I would imagine Pepsi, P&G, etc aren't much different either.

They're actually a bit worse. Oxfam has a ranking, Nestl√© is the second least bad among the 10 biggest food companies. Only Unilever has better score.

https://www.behindthebrands.org/company-scorecard/
>Are they really any different from the next big corporation?

And that's the only excuse they have to, and do, present. Earlier there was a an article about Nestle in places like Brazil (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/16/health/brazil-obesity-nestle.html), when pressed to comment, Nestle simply says it's doing more 'good' than their competitor so fuck off
This makes me sick to look at should be fucking considered a monopoly
The people would much rather pin the blame on something else so long as it meant not actually doing anything about it.
I don't pay a billion dollars for water but I'll pay 40 cents/bottle from the grocery store or $1.25 in a scenario where the convenience is worth it to me.

I like it,  I prefer the taste over tap water. The government should charge Nestle more for the water if it's a problem, and they'd price me out or lower Nestle's profits. Don't blame me, it makes financial sense for me and my priorities. 

As far as Flint goes, they shouldn't need bottled water, thats the problem. I don't see bottled water as a right, I see it as a luxury. The people of Flint aren't being screwed over by the bottled water industry they were screwed over by the city of Flint

Edit: The State, not the city of Flint is screwing over its citizens. thanks for clarifying.
Water form a tap isn't exactly free; water bills are based on consumption.
It's not just about water. Quite a while back in Africa, after a mother had her first child Nestle would give all the new mothers a big basket with bottles and formula. The mothers would use the formula and it would cause them to stop lactating. Which meant they had to buy more formula, thus making nestle more money.

Nestle has been responsible for so many shady things.
Of course it does. Bottling water for third world countries who literally have no access to it makes sense, yes, but it's still a fucking joke that they're turning a profit off of it.

In a developed nation where the only basic necessity cheaper than water is the air we breathe, it's a straight up embarrassment that people buy it.

And before anyone starts rambling about Flint, that's an exception and it wasn't due to the water purification process. It was because of the pipes that water was being sent through.
What about a Brita? Give your money to the companies that provide the means for clean tap water, not the ones that provide the water (well, make sure you pay your water bill). 
Yep, it's not just the places that don't have clean drinking water period, but also modern towns and cities where the tap water is within "safe to drink" boundaries but tastes disgusting. Our tap water here has a strong metallic taste with a bit of chlorine, which a Brita filter will fix but many go for the bottled water instead
Why is nobody mentioning filtering your own water? I don't know that any community has water I'd be willing to drink straight from the tap.
Why dont people just filter it?  Seriously.  People out west build their own ceramic filtration systems or build one that they just have to assemble.  If you can't get a big tank why dont they just buy those ceramic filters that go on the sink.  They filter out everything from salmonella, chemicals, to lead.  


Or they could by a $10 coil of copper from Lowes and just distill their tap water.  I understand that their water pipes need to be fixed but their is no excuse to not have clean drinking water when there are cheap proven methods that have been around for thousands of years.
The real question is how much is Nestle paying politicians to screw over their state's taxes in exchange for new golf clubs. 
I feel like you can't just blanket all of Asia with that.  Japan has fine water, and I don't remember any issue in Thailand, either, but that was like 2004, so maybe I forgot?

You could vote in local elections. Which are the people who award these contracts.
Did it say that in the article?
I think it's mainly a numbers game. If you sell a lot of bottles, you don't need a lot of profit per bottle.
Get a water filter
It's almost as if bottlers are providing a valuable service that the government won't.  Really makes you think.
Not just that, bottles are way more convenient to pack in a lunchbox when I go to work where there may or may not be a water source that probably doesn't even put out potable water. 

It's almost like bottled water has a purpose outside of drinking around your home only.

Also it's way easier to just toss a case of bottled water in your car than to fill up your own bottles to add up to that amount and store them in a way that they don't go everywhere.
Really?  like Monsanto I think they get a shitty rep for doing normal stuff.  OMG they pay the market rate for water?  then sell it?  Funny no one gets mad at Coke, so if Nestle added some sugar it would be ok? 
so.. perfect guess?
That's about the most imperial unit I've ever heard of.
It's a standard measure for large volumes of water, like lakes or reservoirs. And acre is an area, 43560 square feet. Now take that area, and give it a depth of one foot. There ya go.
Only in America these days. The rest of the world uses Megalitres or m3.
I would have thought they would've jumped at the chance to make a bunch of money. Unless the plant was at capacity
Yeah but muh karma for muh fake internet story
acre of water, 1 foot deep.  1 furlong x 1 chain x 1 foot.  660 ft x 66 ft x 1 ft.  43560 cubic ft.

Sometimes here we have to let it sit in a fridge and the weird taste goes away. No idea what it is but my water from the faucet tasted weird.. coffee.  Weird... Anything with it..weird. 

The city said to just have it in a open bottle in the fridge or in the open for a bit and it would be good. So I got a Britta jug, and sure enough it's great.. maybe this?

Also bigger cities water is just weird in general 
Which part of Jersey you in? I grew up there and I'm there now. I've lived in south, central, and north parts and never ever had an issue with the water.

Might be a growing up there thing, acquired taste? But I really don't think my taste buds are that off. I like the tap water in most other metro areas as well.
Try a distiller, or reverse osmosis system. You can get a decent home distiller unit for like $150 or so that makes a gallon in a few hours give or take, and distilling really is the only way to completely remove everything - RO is much better than, say, a brita filter which is doesn't filter to a small enough micron for certain things. I know, for example, that if you want to remove fluoride from water you have to use RO or distillation.

Also, you can buy minerals to add to water after distilling to 'soften' it for dirt cheap online, as drinking pure distilled water could potentially be bad for you in the long run. So, everything considered, distillation seems like the best option for water purification. 

I haven't really seen anyone mention this in this thread either, everyone reccomends a brita or something but if your water is very contaminated with god knows what, or you are just a health nut like me, a filter like that isnt going to be sufficient. Especially once it starts to get gunked up. I guess those are fine for filtering water for pasta or something, though.
That *really* depends upon where in NJ. It literally varies from town to town.   
  
I mean take for instance the Wanaque Reservoir located in Wanaque and Ringwood NJ. The reservoir is fed from the mountain springs and brooks of the Wyanokie highlands. It is what feeds cities like Newark and is why Anheizer Busch moved part of their operations to Newark..    
While Wanaque and Ringwood's water for their residents is either fed through the resident's own well or supplied through an artesian well depending upon where they are in the towns, the water is still excellent tasting water.  
Go to the next town over, Pompton Lakes, and the water tastes like shit, is very hard, and barely passes water tests. Not to mention that it was contaminated by Du Pont.. and though it's claimed everything is fine now, every couple years they find something else wrong with the water.      
  
Go to the town next to that, Wayne, and the water is good again.. 
  
Now go 30 miles south to Basking Ridge the water itself is "clean" but my God it is absolutely  undrinkable. I'm not 100% sure where the water comes from but you are dealing with some water company called American Water.  
I guess depending upon where the water is sourced from with that company varies from region to region.
  
I never realized how much some people pay in water bills until I moved down there for a year or so. But I guess that's because it is being piped through multiple towns etc. Where if your municipality has an a good source of water the price to treat and transport that water goes down massively.   
  
  
My point is even though I went on a tangent, is you can't say x states water sucks when there are so many different types of terrain in that state which affect the taste and quality of the water. As eveything changes even 5 miles down the road.
You wash your reusable water bottle every time you refill it?
Didn't they do some messed up stuff with baby formula?
> It's so easy to hate on Nestle. Sure there are a couple questionable instances that we should call them out for but for the most part they are doing nothing ***illegal***.

Change in bold. 
Child labor workforce to the rescue!
What about all the child slavery though?
It's the principle that is so terrible. They are taking so much of something that should be a basic human right and are making a fortune crime it. They are taking so much in many instances that there is not enough clean water left over. 


The point is that no, what they're doing is not illegal. But that doesn't make it good. What they are doing is not long term or short term good for the world. 
You selling anything? Maybe we could arrange somthing
Wow, it's almost like they did work they expect to be paid for. Those greedy bastards amirite
Wow it's almost like we know this is happening but still partake in it because we value it highly.

A weird world we live in. 
There is this old circlejerk on reddit about bottled water. And about Nestle. Not sure where it comes as there are much more outrageous things to get upset about in the world, but thats how it is...

Like sure you can drink water from your tap and save on some plastic and transportation. You can also not browse reddit and waste useful electricity. You can save useful fuel by not going to the cinema or some equally trivial leisure activity. You can eat less, you don't need that much to survive.
Hail Skroob!
Would you like free basic food as well? Maybe free basic housing?
Yes that's why he added another incredibly sarcastic remark.
Do we really need 23 brands of deodorant when there's children starving in our country?
Interesting, I mostly hear about coke and nestle doing bad thing, and never hear about the worse companies.

It's good to see some improvement, but I think they could definitely do more. Ultimately though it's up to consumers to make informed decisions (some progress) or government to regulate things like how much water they can take
I dislike your attitude, but I agree with your conclusion.
Bottled water tastes exactly the same as tap water, double blind taste tests over the years have shown this. Saying that you think it tastes better is a pretty poor reason to choose it since you likely think it tastes better because you want it to taste better as you paid more money.

Can't argue with convenience though.  
yea but its like 0.2 cents per gallon on average, which is stupid cheap
Edit: I am receiving comments arguing against my claims. I used vague language suggesting I was not an authority on the subject, but I made the claims, anyway, and do not want to mislead anyone, so [here's what Wikipedia has to say on the topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott#Baby_milk_issue). They know more than some dude on the internet (i.e., me):  
  
> Groups such as the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) and Save the Children argue that the promotion of infant formula over breastfeeding has led to health problems and deaths among infants in less economically developed countries. There are three problems that can arise when poor mothers in developing countries switch to formula as well as one list of benefits of breast milk:  
>   
> * Formula must be mixed with water, which is often impure or not potable in poor countries, leading to disease in vulnerable infants. Because of the low literacy rates in developing nations, many mothers are not aware of the sanitation methods needed in the preparation of bottles. Even mothers able to read in their native language may be unable to read the language in which sterilization directions are written.  
> * Although some mothers can understand the sanitation standards required, they often do not have the means to perform them: fuel to boil water, electric (or other reliable) light to enable sterilisation at night. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in disease-ridden and unhygienic conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child.  
> * Many poor mothers use less formula powder than is required, in order to make a container of formula last longer. As a result, some infants receive inadequate nutrition from weak solutions of formula.  
> * Breast milk has many natural benefits lacking in formula. Nutrients and antibodies are passed to the baby while hormones are released into the mother's body. Breastfed babies are protected, in varying degrees, from a number of illnesses, including diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and respiratory infection.  Breast milk contains the right amount of the nutrients essential for neuronal (brain and nerve) development. The bond between baby and mother can be strengthened during breastfeeding. Frequent and exclusive breastfeeding can also delay the return of fertility, which can help women in developing countries to space their births. The World Health Organization recommends that, in the majority of cases, babies should be exclusively breast fed for the first six months, and then given complementary foods in addition to breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.  
>   
> Advocacy groups and charities have accused Nestl√© of unethical methods of promoting infant formula over breast milk to poor mothers in developing countries.  For example, IBFAN claim that Nestl√© distributes free formula samples to hospitals and maternity wards; after leaving the hospital, the formula is no longer free, but because the supplementation has interfered with lactation, the family must continue to buy the formula. IBFAN also allege that Nestl√© uses "humanitarian aid" to create markets, does not label its products in a language appropriate to the countries where they are sold, and offers gifts and sponsorship to influence health workers to promote its products.  Nestl√© denies these allegations.  
  
My original comment: I believe a big part of the problem was not that they had to buy more formula, but that they couldn't afford to buy more formula, thus *making babies die.* Pretty horrible. Whenever possible, I've always tried to avoid buying Nestle products.  
Also - women naturally don't ovulate when they breastfeed. Stopping lactation prematurely with formula takes away a key form of family planning where other methods aren't accepted/known. 
Agreed. I wrote an essay on is in college.  Nestle is the devil.
While preparing for Harvey, I saw a lot of comments about how stupid it was for people to buy bottled water instead of just storing tap water.

And then the photos started rolling in. Brown tap water, containers of water with a layer of sediment on the bottom, etc.. Not everyone has access to palatable drinking water 24/7/365. 
 
The water in my town is garbage and tastes awful. I just got a reverse osmosis system and installed it.

It often smells like a poorly kept pool (chlorine) or rotten eggs (sulfur) and even when it doesn't, it still tastes pretty bad.
Flint isn't the exception though. It's by far the worst, but many towns across the US have problems with drinking water. And even then many houses, especially older ones, might not have pipes that are up to standard. Also, I can close a bottle of water, so it's portable and reusable, and safer around electronics.
TIL the US is a 3rd world country.

Thanks to just truly awesome zoning regulations, our state had a chemical storage facility stored just upstream from the water company's intake. The chemical that leaked destroyed the seals on the intake filters and our entire water supply was contaminated for miles. It took a week for the water to even be safe to use for bathing, my SO had dry skin for months after being caught in the shower when it happened. The crud would have your whole house smelling like black licorice if you ran the faucet while it was contaminated.

I'm sorry but I don't drink tap since that happened. I don't want to be on the receiving end of the next big incident.
> the only basic necessity cheaper than water is the air we breathe

Actually, the problem WAS the water purification process, or more accurately, an interaction between the purification process and the pipes.  Lots of old cities still use lead pipes, and that's ok as long as the right amounts of anti-corrosive agents are added to the water.  The problem in Flint is when they changed water sources, the chemistry of the incoming water changed, and they didn't add the right certain chemicals when they should have.

[Here's](http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i7/Lead-Ended-Flints-Tap-Water.html) a good breakdown of the situation.
Midwest reporting in, the town I live in now has drinkable tap water, and just an hour down the highway, my family has tap water that is on boil alert 80% of the time. 


It may be a joke to you, but packaging water is a brilliant idea. Tell the people in hurricane fucked areas that bottle water is a joke.



Now also take into consideration the shipping costs to get bottles of water places. Consider the cost of the plant to mold the bottles, pump the water in, and seal the bottles, and continue them down the line to be shipped. Consider the cost of the employees monitoring the equipment, driving the trucks, and making sure random people don't walk into the assembly line. Pretty soon, you have a company cooked up. And that takes money to run.




Are they making too much off of people in a bad situation? Sure. 


Would they be able to do it for free without charging from the onset?

 No chance in hell.
Looks like someone should become a bottled water mogul and give back to the people. When you decide to do that ill give a shit. Until then people bitching about other people not doing enough good isnt news.
Go drink tap water in Phoenix and get back to me... is it safe? Yes. Has it run through a sulfur field and smell like dead rat...? yes

You obviously haven't heard of Corpus Christi, Texas. We have had one water boil/ no water at all notice at least once every year.
> In a developed nation where the only basic necessity cheaper than water is the air we breathe, it's a straight up embarrassment that people buy it.

To be fair, it's not the water you are paying for, it's the convenience of having it at that time and place.  
Isn't Brita just a carbon filter? Kind of pricey and they don't filter much other than calm a little of the bad taste. If you live in an area with hard water then they do practically nothing. RO systems are the way to go but they use 5 gallons to make 1 gallon of drinking water.
Used to drink out of the tap all the time. Spent some time in another country (the "safe drinking water" kind), drank from the tap all the time, came back, and discovered that the water from my own tap made my tongue and throat burn. I assume I had just gotten used to my crappy water. Now I avoid drinking from the tap as much as i can.  
If a filter jug will "fix" it, then an inlet filter will as well. It's a little more upfront cost but lasts much longer and means all the water from your tap is filtered.

Worth it if you own your own place.
NYC and SF both have delicious drinking water, piped in from snowmelt sources in nearby mountains.

But yeah, most places have terrible-tasting water.  Brita, carbon block filter, etc.  We have never bought bottled water on the regular, because filtering your own is easier and more convenient.
Nepal, for example, doesn‚Äôt. Not for western stomachs. 
I vote, but it's the constant paradox of being stuck voting for crook A or crook B.  Money talks.  Money corrupts.  No politician is immune.  Every single one of them has their price.
That's called economies of scale and it applies to just about every industry. 
I don't want the government getting involved with bottling water. I enjoy drinking water that keeps the benevolent wheel of capitalism spinning, thank you very much.
Why not use a reusable water bottle? Instead we are filling our landfills and oceans with plastic.

Nestle is trying to get a monopoly on water, buying up wells all over the world. CEO said "free water is not a basic human right". Not to mention the drug dealer-like tactics they've used with baby formula in developing countries. Nestle is as evil as they come.
Proud of you :)
Cause litres was just too simple.
The fuck happened to good ol' cubic meter aka 1 ton aka 1000 bottles of 1 litre each ?
Ah okay that makes sense
Seriously switch to metric
Yeah, a neighbor mentioned that to me when I told them about my issues. They said after a while you get used to it, but I feel its just easier to get 2-3 big packages of water from Costco.
It's got a very strong chlorine smell in those type of areas, so my guess is it's the chlorine. Which evaporates when you leave it out. I've got the same problem, and double filtering works for me. Ones a Britta, one's some.other filter from my fridge.
yeah they pushed baby formula manufacturing in under developed countries that lack sanitation standards. rip babies 
As Michael Kinsley said, "The scandal isn't what's illegal, the scandal is what's legal."
Too bad all the laws we'll ever need have already been written.
yet iphones still cost $1000
[deleted]
So they are doing the same thing as many other industries.

Hell booze is the pritty much the same, except that actually kills people
>basic human right


How do you figure?
[deleted]
> They are taking so much in many instances that there is not enough clean water left over.

Instances such as? Tap/toilet water is just as good as bottled water. Do you not have access to tap water at home or have eve ran into issues with getting tap or toilet water? The principal that they're buying water and selling it as water bottles to customers who prefer bottles for convenience is so so terrible /s

Talking about the US here.
Hell yeah, this is America. Those starving children should come to us
Bottled waters don‚Äôt even taste the same, so how can they all taste exactly like tap? 

The point is, I don‚Äôt really need to justify it to anyone, right?
And that's what the bottle water companies pay, except they pay for their own filtration and stuff. The water company filters your water, not the water they sell to the bottlers.
> Whenever possible, I've always tried to avoid buying Nestle products.

Kinda hard since they own like a fifth of all mega corporations. 
As an aside, I bought one of these as kind of a joke for my mom a while back.  We live in NY so Sandy was the last thing that hit us, but it seems like it would be really useful if you live in a place like Florida or w/e that get's ravaged for one month a year.

https://www.thereadystore.com/65-gallon-emergency-bathtub-water-container
Note: I've never bought anything from this site.  I wasn't expecting the comment to even be looked at, I bought mine at amazon which seems to be sold out.

Basically it goes in your bath tub, you feel it with water pre storm and you have drinking water for quite a bit of time.  65 gallons could probably last a normal family of 5 at least 2-3 weeks for drinking water assuming around a gallon of water a day, but I'm sure people can survive on even less.

If you live anywhere that gets horrible storms like this, one of these seems essential in a hurricane preparedness kit.
Hurricane prep is different than buying it for every day consumption. 
For clarification, did you intend to use the word 'palatable' or did you mean 'potable?'

Also, if you did mean 'palatable' - those inline water filters that go on the end of the tap like Brita filters do remove unfavorable odors from otherwise very potable drinking water.  

For the vast majority of people who DID buy bottled water it was very stupid and wasteful and they could have stored tap water easily.
I live in NY and thats my tap water, it turns brown and its absolutely disgusting 
Unfortunately, if there's a swimming pool smell, it isn't the chlorine you're smelling: https://youtu.be/S32y9aYEzzo
I'm not disputing the rest of your argument but:

> Also, I can close a bottle of water, so it's portable and reusable, and safer around electronics.

I never got this. Just buy a bottle and fill it up?
The water in my community is legally safe to drink, but it's past 13 on the hardness scale, tastes like a swimming pool, and has all sorts of other bonus ingredients that are, again, legally safe to drink.

Some people install a water softener system or reverse osmosis system, but not everybody has the option (renters, for example, may be prohibited from doing so) and so end up purchasing bottled water because their legally safe to drink water is disgusting.
It's not the only exception and just buy a fucking waterbottle. 
What you're saying is "It's easier to just give up and buy another region's water from Nestle than to hold our politicians accountable for failing us on basic infrastructure while they tax us to death."
You can also bottle your own water for that very reason. You can filter water from streams and lakes and wells. Hell, you can walk into a McDonald's and get a cup of water for free.

If you have access to clean tap water and you give these companies money, you are 100% part of the problem and the very reason they get away with this shit.
Since most bottled water is just bottled tap water...this sounds like they're selling bottled water from Flint? Is Nestle peddling lead water across the us?
My community had a toxic waste dump of unknown chemicals installed back in the 70's... And the chemical started to leak into the water table and contaminated the local's wells and they got serious illnesses until it was shutdown in the 80's... By the 90's, the government forced everyone in the community to get onto the city's water supply, during a clean up effort (the chemical is still there, but supposedly more secured) even waived the hookup fee and deemed the water unfit to drink. 

Ironically, the city's water intake is literally less than a mile downstream from he dumpsite.....

Edit: Oh, and there's a uranium de-enrichment plant upstream that leaks raw uranium into the river. Yay!
Hello, fellow MCHM test subject! I know plenty of people here who won't drink tap water because of this.

I do, but I understand why others wouldn't trust it. 
5 gallon jugs. Cheaper and doesn't butt rape the environment.
Hey, fellow WV dude! The judge just passed an agreement on the settlement, so hopefully we can get something back after the hot water tank I had to replace and tons of money spent on packaged water. 

That shit sucked. 
They're selling convenience, not water. Not sure why this concept is so hard for everyone to grasp 
Same for West Virginia.
Dunno I forget the numbers but once I calculated hardness before and after and it was pretty significant. Also whenever it is close to expiring I know cause the electric kettle quickly whitens from the minerals, as if I had used unfiltered water.
Perhaps it wasn't your taste that changed, but rather the quality of the tap water decreased. I mean, look at Flint...
Then vote for an ascetic.
That means you should run. Then the money would be yours.
He said it shouldn't be a basic human right*

He said that, because he believes we WAY overuse water where it's available, watering our gardens and using clean water for toilets (yay, US), while a lot of the world and even a lot of US states struggle to have clean water in their taps. Water for drinking and for washing is a small percentage next to water for gardening, which is a huge waste.

We really, really need to work on people just quoting bullshit and perpetuating "pure evil" as an existing concept. Maybe if there was a place where one can read a headline and then follow up with the full quotes and statements...

Let's try this [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/24/nestle-chairman-time-to-turn-off-the-water-taps.html).

In fact, below I'm giving you a quote from the link. I'll even straight tell you the bad: about 1/3 of the water is wasted while bottling. But the following numbers should be a much more rude awakening call.

>  "Water is a human right. I fully agree with that," Brabeck-Letmathe said, noting that the around 30 liters a day needed for basic living should be provided without charge to those who can't afford it. But that amount is only accounts for around 1.5 percent of the fresh water destroyed daily, he said.

> He's more concerned about the other 98.5 percent. "I don't think it's a human right to fill up a swimming pool. I don't think it's a human right to wash cars. I don't think it's a human right to water a golf course," he said.

98.5%. But again. Better read the full thing. Don't count on random quotes.

[Here's another good link](https://www.wired.com/2006/03/farms-waste-much-of-worlds-water/). [Here's a third one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/17/the-incredibly-stupid-way-that-america-wastes-1-trillion-gallons-of-water-each-year/). There's many more. In fact, if you really wanted to know you would've already googled "How much water is wasted?". But do you really want to know?
That is ~1.233 megaliters of water.
To be fair, acre foot is useful because it is a metric that any farmer can readily recognize. But yes, it is stuck in the imperial system. A litre would be easy to convert. 
I thought a ton was imperial.
Does it?
[deleted]
I agree that from a math perspective, metric is easier, but from a distance and weight estimation perspective (which is mostly how we use these units), I think the english units are still easier and more useful in real life.  Centimeters are too small and meters are too large.   Kilograms are also too large.  No one really uses the intermediate units enough to be able to visualize them well enough.
Where I am in OH the water at home smells like chlorine almost, tastes like it but its not too strong. I was just too lazy to keep buying bottled water because I got tired of lugging the cases inside making multiple trips (too lazy gotta carry it all in at once) so now I am used to it but it still does smell a little to me.
By the way, if you just add chlorine to water, it should have no smell. If there's something like urine in the water, the chlorine reacts with it to form chloramines. The chloramines are what's responsible for that smell we all associate with pools. 
Yeah the aftermath still continues too. We get Chinese people buying out shelves in our supermarkets here in Australia to send back to China. They go particularly crazy when there is a sale on the most popular brands. It was only in the last 2 weeks when I seen a family in a store that had a trolley full and later seen them loading their van and it looked like they had hit a few otger stores that day already.

They  sell them on eBay for rediculous amounts with the average price being roughly 5 times their retail price. I did hear of people selling them for as much as $500 per can online at the peak but I was never able to confirm those claims. 
They gave new mother's just enough powder so they would stop producing milk. It takes around a week or so of not breast feeding. Since they can't feed the baby that way anymore they are forced to continue using the powder. 
But that's just a couple of "questionable" instances, right? For the most part they do nothing wrong. /s
Yeah bu-bu-but it's unfair somehow that bottled water companies pay the same price I do for water and then purify, bottle it, distribute it, and people buy it.
Yeah. I definitely wasn't suggesting that I've been successful at it. But it's worth trying. 
[I tried to screenshot the whole list from Wikipedia but it was too long and scroll capture gave up. ](https://i.imgur.com/9KKKVMS.jpg)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands
It's true that avoiding certain companies is very challenging, but not impossible with a little homework and effort. There are apps like Buycott that can help you know which products and brands to avoid based on what parent company you're trying to stop supporting. It's more work initially, but then you just get into a rhythm only buying particular products/brands.

Somewhat related, Nestle is also a major player in child slavery on cocoa plantations in West Africa. Don't support these scum bags and just buy a different chocolate bar, preferably one with a big "Fair Trade" sticker on the label.
I can't think of any of their products that's actually good though. It's pretty much all junk food like their cereals and kitkat, or inexplicably expensive like vittel and nespresso. I suppose they might have subsidiaries that have more tempting products, but according to Wikipedia their revenue mostly comes from junkfood.
I have a 100 gallon version of this. For $20, it's a great deal. 

Filling the bathtub is fine for water for flushing the toilet or for personal hygiene. But with a bladder, the water stays clean enough to drink.

10/10, would recommend.
My bath tub seems to be pretty good at storing water already
"if you live in a place like Florida or w/e that get's ravaged for one month a year."


Florida native here. Prior to this year, we haven't been "ravaged" by a hurricane in over a decade 

Edit: My reference point
Definitely. My roommate at uni last year insisted on drinking only from bottled water that he had delivered by the store for a markup, even though we had a water filter pitcher that we kept filled and refrigerated.
I did mean palatable.

I have 6 children and a husband. I was advised by local and federal government to store two weeks worth of water, allowing 1 gallon per person per day. That means I needed to store 112 gallons of water. And that's just for my family. I also needed water for the families that I ended up sheltering when their homes flooded.

Now, in my case I have a whole house water softener and reverse osmosis system. I need both to make the water palatable; a Brita filter doesn't do the job. Because of my set up, I was able to use bladders in the bathtubs to store 200 gallons of tap water. But not everyone has this setup. And I only had 18 people in my home. Other people in my neighborhood sheltered 30-40 people. 

Exactly how many containers suitable for water storage do all y'all have on hand?

Bro what? Where in NY?? My NY tap water is the best water I've ever drank. Stricter regulations than bottled water, and tastes better. 
Brown is rust, from your pipes...
http://environmentalprotech.com/drinking-water-health-risk-chloramines

I knew it was chloramines, which aren't just from pee.
Yeah. I agreed with him up to that point. Good reusable bottles/containers will last forever, and you can clean them out for pretty much ever.
Agreed, I also got tired of paying so much for water when I go to amusement parks and airports. I bring my reusable bottle everywhere now. It is nice that a lot of places now have public access to filtered water. 
In China that's what people do. Everybody walks around with their bottle and fill them up with boiled water (because nobody trusts the tap water).
Do you live in my town? Everyone I know who lives south of town either hauls in bottled water or has a good filtration system because water from the tap is usually tinted brown. 
[deleted]
You can install a reverse osmosis system in an apartment, just uninstall it when you leave. Or you could install a normal run of the mill filter. Or as the other person said, use a brita, or pur, or any brand of filter you want to. 
Fundamentally safe drinking water treatment is a simple process, filter and chlorinate. That's it. 

If you water tastes like crap its picking up stuff from the supply lines, if you ad you tap water tested and its safe, try a activated carbon filter.
New York is hilarious. Our water is fantastic yet people always have bottled water everywhere. 

This is one of those examples of how we really just do not give a fuck.
I work in the film industry and we are definitely a MAJOR part of the problem. A few sets will get a water cooler and tell people to bring a reusable bottle, but even then they still need actual plastic bottles for the people who don't bring one. We just go thru at least 2 pallets a day.
How about the numerous studies on antidepressants and birth control in tap water? I know it's mostly city water but still, some cities have gross ass water and the only remedy is bottled water or a purifier. 
No. Read the article. Nestle got water for essentially free because they pumped and purified the water themselves, independently from the city's services. When you pay your water bill, you don't actually pay for the physical water, you pay for the service of piping and purifying that water.
How many ultraliters is that?
>megaliters 

What's wrong with that? How is saying acre-foot any better than saying megalitres?

If you see something in *mega*litres, you think right - thats 10^9 litres.

You see something in acre-foot, and if you dont initially ask 'wtf's an acre foot?', you'll be asking how many litres or gallons that is.

The rest of the world and the entire scientific community seem to have figured it out.

A farmer who grew up in America. A farmer in practically anywhere else would ask wtf is an acre foot.
This is the problem with most imperial measurements, that they exist to make it really easy for anyone to guesstimate fairly imprecisely, but makes it very difficult to work with any precision.

Nobody denies that a farmer having a good ol' yarn can roughly estimate something with his neighbour, but there's no precision I'm sure there's an infinite number of possible estimates.
A metric ton or tonne can refer to a mass of 1000 kilograms. The technical SI term is megagram its common in some countries to use them interchangeably.
Yeah, if youre a land surveyor. 
Like myself... Lol.
But does it got but does it go 161,280 furlongs per fortnight?
I disagree completely. The only reason imperial is so natural is because we never get any real sense of metric until adulthood. If I say 300ft or 100yd it is the same distance and you won't really be able to visualize it any better than if I say 91 meters.
kg are too large for you? Cool juste use hg if you wish. cm are too small? Use dm. See. It works.  But spoiler alert. The whole world use m/cm and g/kg, there must be a reason.
That's only cos you were brought up around them. If your argument were true the rest of the world would suck at estimating stuff.

There are also British colonies the world over - hell, even Britain - using metric and their societies haven't imploded.
>Centimeters are too small and meters are too large. Kilograms are also too large.

Is this a joke or have you literally never learned what the metric system is?

Meters are roughly the same thing as yards, feet are roughly a third of a metre and an inch is roughly  2.5cm. Centimeters are much better for modern measurements, inches are massive and any time you have to measure something smaller than an inch you use fractions. Fractions are hard, that's a proven thing, just try adding and multiplying them as easily as you do with regular whole numbers. You'll lose track much faster.

 Best part, every measurement is base ten. I ask this question all the time in the US, but nobody can tell me how many yards are in a mile, let alone how many feet or especially inches. Most people just don't know.

Yeah when I worked at Coles, I think we had to create a rule that meant no person could buy more than four at once.
Most large retailers now have a 4 per customer limit in aus
In China, baby formula is (in part, correctly) seen as a safer alternative to local milk products and derivatives, as there have been quite a few poisoning scandals.
In that case it is because counterfeit food (and in the past, baby formula cut with melamine) are common in China. US food brands are more trusted.

This is an interesting video on how fake eggs are manufactured. 
  Besides their competitive advantage by pulling all the shady shit helped them buy out more ethical companies like rowntrees. When I was in school our history teacher had a major boner for what the Rowntrees established at New Earswick, the village they established for their factory workers, and their sponsoring of malnutrition studies via the Rowntree report.
 When Nestle bought them out after I left school I imagined him howling to the winds "those bloody bastards" in a thick Welsh accent before falling to his knees a la charlton Heston in planet of the apes.
I don't know why, he wasn't welsh,
I have a friend who left his job and swore to never buy any of their products, the company that he works for has around 50% of the distribution of products in my country, it's funny watching him enjoy a popsicle or chips and then getting angry when he reads the box.
The problem is also that product X is made by A, which is owned in part by B, C, D, E - which again are all owned in different sized parts by F, G, H, I, J - some of which are again owned by C, Nestle/Evil Corp, H, P, E and Q.

So you're considering whether to buy A and if Nestle owns part of it, you don't want it.

So you see B, C, D, and E own it. Great - and you even go to the second link, and still no Nestle.

So unless H is actually called Mini-Nestle or whatever, it's hard to figure out. And maybe Nestle only owns 2.5% of F - so are you still boycotting them? Would you even be able to find out, in order to boycott them?
Wow, I'm surprised to find that I pretty much do avoid Nestle. Makes me wonder what I do eat, though.
Damn! I thought I was in the clear and then I saw they own 30% of the Body Shop Stores? Well I can live without it. Nice job linking the list!
Their hazelnut supply chain also uses child labour (Turkey)
Hadn't seen your comment before I posted. 

Buycott is a great app, debunking the illusion of choice has been a long process but I am finally to a place where I have weeded out the products that I can't justify buying. 

Fair trade isn't always as great as it should be. Think Starbucks fair trade coffee. While it is an improvement over Hershey's chocolate, the real growth in the cacao industry comes from companies that develop working relationships directly with farms and co-ops. Some shining examples: Dandelion (higher end) and Tcho ( more readily available and affordable).
You think this is about chocolate? Have you seen Nestl√©'s Wikipedia page? It's insane how much they own :(
The version linked is 100 Gallons capable, but the video explains that most tubs are ~70 gallons, so the recommend only filling to around 65 gallons, to make sure you don't break your tub.
yeah, but its exposed to open air and I dunno about you, but I do some pretty horrible things in my tub.

Not to mention if you let it just sit there for days/hours it will accumulate dust and other nasties since your tub likely doesn't come with a lid.
Agreed. But our aquifer is ravaged daily by Nestl√© and other water bottling companies (and other industries) pumping millions of gallons every day and depleting our precious aquifer without even paying for it. 

"Hey, where are all these [sinkholes](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/sinkholes.html) coming from?"

But Florida has always been a corporate sellout state, and never more so than under Rick Scott, who DGAF about the people of this state. 

Your roommate was literally pissing away money.
I'm an average single male. I have 12 gallons stored. I run mine through a Brita pitcher due to taste and for storage. The other thing I do is keep lightly flavored kool-aid water on the bottom shelf of my fridge, I drink enough of it, but that's an extra 6 gallons. 
>Exactly how many containers suitable for water storage do all y'all have on hand?

Enough for basic hurricane preparedness like **everyone** who lives in a hurricane area should be.  I have several 5 gallon water containers and 2 bathtub bladders.  All reusable. I could also store water in Coleman style coolers if necessary.

And you're moving the goalposts on your comment - no-one was talking about sheltering 15-40 people - this was about your average invidividual or family - in which case storing enough tap water is **not** difficult.  Obviously the needs of a shelter will be different.

I still find your original comment to make not sense - what do all those people 'who do not have access to 'palatable' water' do the rest of the time ??? Bottled water 24x7x365?? That's even worse.
Did you plan to shelter this many people? I understand how blunt this question might sound at first, but I'm not criticizing you personally.

Preparation for any disaster involves budgeting for a certain number of people to be covered under that plan.

If you plan to shelter 18 people ahead of time, I'm sure that you can suss out the details. If you don't have the supplies for 18 people, then you don't have the supplies. Everyone you shelter will suffer as a result of taking on too many people. I get the idea that you might want to help as many as possible, but there's a reason there are weight limits on elevators. Your plans, like an elevator brake cable, are only ever designed for a certain amount of load.

My brother and I have a two-bedroom apartment in central Wisconsin, and we can shelter around 10 for two weeks. We've got two water bladders for the bathtubs in each of the bathrooms that'll hold about 70 gallons (one for drinking and one for washing). We also have several stacks of bottled water in the closet.

Yes, I know. Bottled water is a waste. That's the OP's point, but when you're at CostCo anyway and 30 bottles is $2.50... buying one or two reams of water at a time will add up. Right now we have 600 bottles of water in our walk-in closet. That's about another 80 gallons. When I have a picnic or a work event, I can cycle the oldest ream out and bring it in a cooler for others to enjoy, then I just buy another the next time I shop! $2.50 is pretty cheap in potluck terms!

Of course, we have a backlog of pantry food as well to supplement our water, but we also have tons of games and things to do when the power's out. It's not just about survival, but about keeping your sanity and hanging on to something that makes you feel human.

As a final point, we also have the ability to sleep this number of people in relative comfort. We have a couch, futon, or air mattress for every spare person.

Planning and budgeting in ALL things in life will guide you to success. If you break your budget, you can expect bad things to come from it.
[deleted]
Not OP but I spent a weekend in the Catskills and the water was from a sulfuric well. It sucked. It smelled like rotten eggs and tasted bad. Taking a shower was miserable because it felt like you were boiling with some eggs.
NYC tap water is godly.
NYC tap water tastes great.

When I lived on Long Island, we got our water from an artesian well. It had enough minerals to change the color of my hair.
I doubt its the local water that's the problem. it's his shitty pipes.
[deleted]
Heard the one about the university which offered a public drinking fountain? Turns out the water was unsafe to drink. In theory all water should be safe to drink if offered in a public setting. 
Also the Chinese tend to not drink cold water because of the belief that its bad for digestion. This belief may be partially due to the dodgy tap water, but that's not the entire reason for it, it goes back to the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine.
Or get a 5 gallon water dispenser. Refills are generally 75 cents to 2 dollars...
Honestly just storing tap water in the fridge will make it taste better (something about chlorine off-gassing, I think), but it‚Äôs probably better to filter out whatever crap is in there first. 
NYC tap water is some of the best in the country for sure.  It's Catskills snow melt.  I never even had a water filter when I lived there.  It tastes great right out of the tap.  Same in the SF Bay Area (Sierra snow melt).
The worst part about it, besides the huge profits, is all the energy put towards creating all these disposable plastic bottles and all the waste from them getting thrown out.  

Where I live, we banned plastic shopping bags.  I wish the same would happen for the bottled water such as you find at gas stations and convenient stores etc.
I'm seeing, "Don't forget your water bottles!" more and more on call sheets.  Also, I'm not in L.A. so maybe we have slightly higher standards in a smaller market.  I love working on shows that actually think about this kind of thing.  I fucking hate producers who refuse to lower themselves to such degrading levels.  The crew can figure it out, but those dicks require anywhere between 25-200 bottles they take 5 little sips out of then leave strewn about the set.  To be clear, that's not all producers.  Just the shitty entitled ones who just don't give a fuck.  

Apparently I needed a little rant.
It's something we've all played a part in. We enabled the scum sucking pieces of shit to capitalize on basic survival needs and now it may very well be too late to do anything about it.
> birth control in tap water

I know some people want free birth control, but this wasn't what I was expecting.
Zero Water filters (https://www.zerowater.com/faq-what-does-it-remove.php) have been independently tested to reduce pharmaceuticals from your tap water. But we should probably all have a reverse osmosis filter under our sink. 
You mind posting any of those studies?
> or a purifier. 

Exactly. There are countless ways out there to purify your own water and a lot of them are far from expensive. There is no justification for paying for bottled water when there are cheaper and just as accessible alternatives.
Water is everywhere. Its super fucking cheap. But making it drinkable, that takes money.
And it basically says that the city is doing a shitty job at cleaning the water.
How many Brita filters is that?
About 0.1 hyperliters
Usually we measure big volumes as m^3. One megalitre is exactly 1000 m^3.  

So when you ask how much water flows trough the Niagara Falls the answer would typically be in m^3.
The only reason you can't estimate with Litres is that you don't use them.
I second that. I find the problem it not the single unit itself but the conversation to bigger or smaller units. Example: How many feet is 1.6miles? You probably now have to start calculating now. With metric units the task of converting 1.6kilometer to meter is trivial and does not require any calculations.

And as previous poster said daily units are just what you are used to. And I have lived both in us and Europe and honestly for that the unit really does not matter. No difference setting an AC in Fahrenheit or Celsius, they work the same.
Yeah, but the Brits stick to imperial for certain things. Pints and stones, the stupidest measurement system, for example.
Oh is it really? Had no idea! Yea the chlorine taste seems to be more common than anything from places I've been. It doesn't bother me too much but I'm just glad it doesn't smell like sulfur. I've stayed places that were like that and showers were always gross

Joseph Rowntree was a magnificent philanthropist. To this day the Rowntree foundation still support poor people with food banks, education, and research that gives the most vulnerable in our society a voice. I'm a huge admirer of the Rowntree family. 
So Unilever, P&G, Kraft or J&J.
I don't live anywhere near any disaster zones, but this sounds like a great excuse to rip out my bathtub, reinforce the floor, and buy install a top of the line bathroom fixture... for the safety of my family of course
Am I the only person who keeps a 50 gallon tank in my home with constantly refreshed water in it? In an emergency just turn off the inflow valve to your water heater, then use the flush spigot to access the water. Tadaa! 50 gallons of clean drinking water with thirty seconds of preparation...
Exactly, I know people say to store water in the tub, but it's just a revolting thought to me.

Maybe, maybe, I could stomach it if I lined the toilet with a plastic liner first and then put water in it. There's no way in hell I'm drinking water from the tub without a liner though, that's fucking nasty.

But then, the problem is, it's open topped, and still exposed to the air in the bathroom, which is revolting itself. Even with a lid, it would feel dirty.
I strictly refuse to buy any Nestle product, not only because of the bottled water, but because they were busted enslaving children in their cocoa fields. Fuck. Nestle. Also fuck Rick Scott's  Voldemort looking ass.
But the state of Florida and the various local entities also have land use policies that prevent the storage of freshwater. Every time a swamp turns into homes, Florida loses more of its capacity to store freshwater.

So Nestle pumps. Sure, but it doesn't matter when you've cut the hydraulic capacity of the region in half.
> Agreed. But our aquifer is ravaged daily by Nestl√© and other water bottling companies

That's the reason why debating these things in absolutes doesn't get us anywhere. Yes, there are plenty of obsolete laws and old contracts that allow certain companies to plunder all sorts of resources for free or cheap. We don't have to ratchet up the cost on principal, but when a resource becomes more scarce or it hurts the local population, or the locals pay more, then it's time to start charging the big boys for use.
He was okay with it because it wasn't his money, he was living off the GI Bill... so he was pissing away *our* money, haha. 
I was not specifically planning on sheltering anyone. But I knew it was likely that I would end up sheltering at least a few people, because I have an elevated home and most homes in my area are not elevated.

The people I took in were strangers who managed to get to my home by walking in water almost 6 feet deep. I couldn't turn them away. They would have drown. 

I am a two time flood victim. I lost all of my belongings in a flood 2 years ago. I don't have "extra" anything. Everything I own is something we use. 

But I wasn't going to let people drown because I don't have air mattresses. A dry seat on the floor is still better than drowning in flood water.
Stuff like this makes me happy I live in NYC as I think our water Quality is pretty high up
the brown/pink scum is a bacterial colony. it's the same stuff that coats river rocks. it forms by hydrophilic bacteria  when they are exposed to water so they don't get washed away. fairly harmless to humans unless you slip on it or it colonized a hip implant. still filter that water as it indicates inadequate treatment, that the fittings need to be cleaned, or that the water has been standing for a significant period.
It's crazy how much water varies from place to place. I live in an area with lots of good, clean water. While the pipes of the specific house make a tiny difference, it's generally all great.

If you drive a bit to get to the nearest city, the water is so bad that no one I know will drink it. I was honestly worried it might not be safe when I stayed there for a while.
This is what it's like in Iceland. Heavy Sulphur smell.

Made me consider inventing bacon-smelling shower gel for those hungover mornings. Would get you hungry for breakfast, at least.
I think that's actually ferrous oxide.  Not to say there isn't also sulfur in the water.  Source: lived in upstate NY for 20 years.
Pro-tip: slowly adjust the temperature of the water until there's only cold water running. That way it'll only smell like you're boiling with eggs. 
It is fuckin delicious 
The nyc water supply is near Woodstock and boy was it good. If you lived near the water main, not super common, you had the best water ive ever had. Of course i had a well.
Where my dad lived in Southern California, they got their water from an artesian well.  The water went through multiple stages of filtration, but it still tasted heavily of minerals.  All of the sinks and tubs had this thick turquoise blue mineral build-up around the drains. 
Don't forget about the 40-50 gallons of clean water in the water heater.
Plus when you want to go camping you just toss a bunch in the cooler and don't have to buy ice
Freezers need to be kept at 0F, not 32F. Twenty pounds of ice will help keep your fridge cold but it won't do much for the freezer. 
everyone get a look at the einstein of ice water over here
Damn, half full?! Why didn't I think of this? Great idea and will be using this going forward, thanks. 
My Indian friend swore up and down that cold water was bad for you. He also claimed hot water had some healing powers. Not sure if it was based on any science, but I'll never give up cold water even if it's true.
We used one of those for many years. Took a trip every week to fill up almost 30 gallons worth. Not easy, now that we live in an RV. 
Off gassing doesn't really work anymore, since they went mostly from chlorine to ~~chloride salts,~~ [Chloramine](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/chloramines-drinking-water) or so reddit tells me.  Apparently the chlorine evaporated too easily, and got expensive and was hard to does correctly.
Wow that's crazy. 

At my work we have this awesome device that dispenses water out of like this fountain looking thing. 

A water fountain 

because my work would never pay for bottled water for employees who were too irresponsible to bring a drinking vessel

If it requires using cool power tools, I'm game.  Call me when you're ready for install...
How old is your water heater, and when was the last time you tried this?

I'm very curious to know if the water that comes out is actually clean or full or mineral sediment.
Water heater water is non palatable. Look it up.
Ah, don't do this. Brain eating amoebas yo. 
> There's no way in hell I'm drinking water from the tub without a liner though, that's fucking nasty.

I'm a retail manager, and when we ran out of water before the last hurricane, I recommended to many people the bath tub trick. Every single time, I added the disclaimer: use it for everything *except drinking*. For drinking, get your own jugs and fill them, then run them through a brita pitcher, or any water filter system. They would then stare at me blankly, then ask: "Uh, and where do I get one of those filter thingies?" It amazes me how many grown adults need their hand held during preparations of any kind. It's the digital age people, use the internet and do some damn research! You have it on your phone! 

I should add that most of these people are life-long Florida residents. I've been living here 10 years and every year, starting with the year I moved here, I have kept a very cheaply obtained disaster prep kit, including water jugs/filters/plenty of rechargeable batteries and portable power back-ups/flashlights (always owned) and tips and tricks printed out BEFORE the season starts. If I use any of it, I get more, if I don't, great! I have it for next year. 

I have a very tough time feeling sympathy for the same people that run around at the last minute trying to find bottled(!) water, batteries, candles, flashlights, etc. the day before, during or right after a major storm. And why do so many people not already own a damn flashlight?? I especially love the folks that act surprised when we run out of stuff....."what do you mean you have no water?!" was actually said to me by a customer when we prematurely were told to open our store the DAY AFTER the hurricane. I had to listen to a customer whine over speakerphone while she shopped about her terrible ordeal without power for 4 HOURS. My power was back on 5 days after that. Some still don't have any. 

Ok, that turned into a bit of a rant. (Not even directed at the person I replied to). 


> they were busted enslaving children in their cocoa fields

[Holy shit.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/child-slavery-claims-against-nestle-cargill-get-one-more-chance)

Or rather, *un*holy shit. 

If corporations are people, they need to be prosecuted like people for the same crimes, even up to execution for murder.

Not that you need another reason but don't forget their scheme to give away samples of their baby formula in third world countries.  They never told the mothers they needed a clean water supply to mix it with and would have to keep buying formula after the samples ran out instead of just giving breast milk.
My "favorite" despicable Nestle story is the [baby formula scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott#Baby_milk_issue) from the 70's.

Again, I will make it clear that my reply to you was NOT meant as a personal criticism. I understand that no one can fully prepare for these things to happen.

That said, you now know the lay of the land in your neighborhood and you know that you might have 18-40 people that need to shelter with you. If you're the type to take them in, then the best you can do for them is to prepare.

That's all I'm trying to say. I hope I haven't offended.  :(
They provided the water toxicology report with the rental and it was most definitely sulfur
That's leaching from your copper pipes. Pretty sure.
We've an in line water heater. We traded apocalypse resource preparedness for an eternity of hot water in the good times ;p 
In an area with very hard water, you should replace your water heater every 2 years. If the water heater has to be replaced, how good is the water within? 
[deleted]
Just make sure you use that little discharge at the bottom of your water heater to clean out sediment.
But then you have a bunch of empty plastic bottles that you have to bring back with you.
I've known very educated people who believed that cold = bad and hot = good in terms of food. When they were confronted by studies or lack of peer-reviewed research supporting their point, they said that "Western people are different inside from Chinese people." It really surprised me how deep that these kinds of traditions go. My parents told me "old wive's tales" growing up but I learned to question the ones that didn't make sense (no Mom, scratching an itch from poison oak does not spread the active agent through your bloodstream). I am scientist so maybe this kind of thinking is just common to me but not among my peers generally. Most of the younger Chinese people I've met love cold boba tea however, so I think young people all over are getting better at questioning the things their parents told them without evidence.
A photo/video production is vastly different from a typical workplace. The shoots I work through blow through bottled water by the case-load or truckload depending on the size of crew and shooting days. 

But yeah walking around set you'll find that empty bottles are greatly outnumbered by half or less drunk bottles. It's pretty sad and a systemic issue in the industry. 
welp, off to the hospital. 

the article said being thirsty is a symptom of cancer. 
That's not a study. There have been no studies. That's an article where they asked  a few people "Hey, what do you think about this sensational media report." and the answer was "We have no idea. Maybe they should do a real study." Parts per billions or parts per trillion is the equivalent of one drop of piss in a gallon of water or less. I'm not sure we can filter much better than that reliably.
> And forget bottled water as a way to escape the low levels of drugs found in some public water supplies. "Twenty five percent of bottled water comes from the tap," she says, citing an NRDC report.

Did you even bother to read the study you linked? It says bottled water doesn't fix the problem because it's just the same tap water put into a bottle. I also sense a slight slant against "cities" and while this study was done on major metropolitan cities, some of the worse offenders are smaller cities and towns such as Flint who haven't kept up with their infrastructure.
This just in, Nestle introduces "Fair trade fancy feast cat food" with new publicity.  
I feel like my cat can taste the human suffering and likes it.
[removed]
But they do not mind stealing California's water and selling it at a huge profit.
Fawk! I just bought fancy feast for my cat! Fawk! 
So capitalism really isn't all that different from slavery...
By purchasing this you are helping low-income people get jobs! Furthermore they will get free tooth removal, when their owner beats them with a hammer! 
Thank you for putting that together! The Nestle Infant Formula tragedy was the first time I ever heard of a corporation engaging in marketing practices that were literally killing babies for profit. Corporations are people whose God is money and even atheists agree this god is real.
The workers should steal a Nestle factory and sell the products for their own profit. 
Live in Maine. It's just ground water. The spring dried up years ago and the water is just pumped into the plant from surrounding towns.
Maybe it's poured through a Slinky into the bottles. The finest "spring" water.
Hey!  I have a relevant story!  

I used to work for a bottling company.  We would make 500 gallon batches of Iced Tea, and we would add exatly one gallon of spring water to each batch so we could legally put "Made with Spring Water" on the label.  Sometimes we would forget.  Ohh well.  Good times. 
"Parent company Nestle......"

Tldr right there. 

EDIT: my inbox : "Just a technicality", "just a nestle hate circlejerk", "nestle isn't all that bad, want to see me put this water bottle up my ass?" No one likes skeezy business practices except those who profit from it. And that's not you or me or 99% of the worlds population. Yes, nestle owns a lot of brands and we probably use some of them day to day, doesn't mean they don't deserve the hate for doing and saying shady shit. Fuck nestle. 

EDIT 2: Thank you stranger for gold. I'm flattered but I'm still not going to be involved in water bottles and ass. 
Tap water is more strictly regulated than bottled water. 
Well, at least we still have Mars bars.
I bet none of it is from Poland either.
> the spokeswoman said in an email. ‚ÄúThe claims made in the lawsuit are without merit and an obvious attempt to manipulate the legal system for personal gain.‚Äù

That's rich, coming from a company that is privatizing public water for pennies and **[believes that "access to water is not a public right."](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-privatisation-of-water-nestle-denies-that-water-is-a-fundamental-human-right/5332238)** 

Fuck Nestle
Sounds like a scandal.

Let's call it Watergate.
Moland Springs is better
Next they're going to try to tell me that [this bottle](http://i.imgur.com/FVWc1ha.jpg) didn't come from a spring either. Everyone knows that the springs in Poland are pure vodka.
[deleted]
Poland cannot into spring.
Next you're going to tell me Fiji water doesn't really come from Fiji. What is this world coming to!?
I thought we figured out bottled water was bullshit a long time ago
Not one drop of baby oil is from babies. Think this would score me a sweet law suit?
But it was bottled from March-June!
What kind is good? I have sulfur in my well
in step with imaginary corporate naming if they just place a spring in the machines water works it becomes spring water
Really? I didn't think a single drop of it was. Kinda how I don't think Mountain Dew is harvested from mountain grass condensation
Nestle extracted 36 million gallons of water from a national forest in California last year to sell as bottled water, even as Californians were ordered to cut their water use because of a historic drought in the state.

And the permit that Nestle uses to operate its water pipeline in the San Bernardino national forest costs just $524 a year. 
Just get a brita pitcher and a metal water bottle. Stop wasting money on bottled water üòÇ. The documentary tapped exposes quite a bit about the bottled water industry. 
I grew up in the area where Poland Spring operates, and have worked for them. Initially, Poland Spring *was* spring water. Expansion of their operation led to them drilling to tap the aquifer that fed the spring directly, then further expansion led to more and more drilled pumps. 

Nestle as a parent company only really has to do with it through their expansion, not so much whether or not it was "spring" water.

Poland is a nice little town, and you can actually find multiple springs in the area.

The real problem is that not only have they tapped into the aquifer directly, negating a lot of the "spring" aspect, they ship water out to other bottling plants, as well as ship water in as needed. Poland Spring water is now sourced from numerous sites throughout the state and region.

However, it is different from a lot of other bottled water in that it is not just tap water taken from a city system. It's actually pumped from the ground, from areas that are/were natural spring water sites to start out with.

Don't get me wrong, Nestle as a parent company has done terrible, terrible things overall. Their operation of their Poland, ME plant has done some questionable things. They force out smaller, locally owned businesses whether through buyouts or if memory serves correctly, litigation over water rights to the springs surrounding the plant that were initially not part of their property. 

But the flip side to that is they do provide quite a number of jobs to the region, bring in tourist money through the association of the spring water with the state, and oddly enough in times of crisis i.e. Hurricane Katrina, the Ice Storm of '98, etc donate massive amounts to those affected - including water by the truckload, power generation (ice storm in particular saw them bring in several truck sized generators of 100+ Kw output power that were used to feed both the plant and surrounding area).

So if people are going to hate, hate on the corporate level. Not the local.
What's worse is that I've heard the Poland content of their water is at an all-time low, as well.
Should have named it Moland Spring like originally planned
Moland Springs water is where it's at.
I've spent two years as a process engineer at a company that processed and bottled water, and got very familiar with this industry. Can confirm that it is rarely directly from a natural source. Our "spring" was our main line in from the city supply that had been blessed by the local government and given a name. With that said, the water produced there absolutely was more safe than anything occurring at a truly natural source.
I thought this was already known?  Didn't it come to light back in the early 2000s or so that it was basically tap water?
I thought this was already common knowledge that all of that was bs
Not surprised at all especially since it's parent company is Nestle!
Some people in the US don't even have good water, and people are suing each other over semantics. Makes sense, i guess.
>"the country‚Äôs best-selling bottled water"

I have literally never heard of this product until today
Guys.. I think we need to investigate Mountain Dew... 
It's a fucking Nestle subsidiary, of course they're selling you the tears of the dying. 
Next thing you'll tell me,  it's not from Poland 
But what if they bottle it when it is Spring in Poland?
Pretty much all bottled water is just purified municipal water, anyway. Anyone who tells you differently is probably trying to sell you bottled water. 
This is the least of nestles crimes.

I don't care where the water came from, as long as they didn't steal it from people who depend on it and it's reverse osmosis filtered im cool with it....

But.....Fuck nestle and their treatment of natural fresh water sources, their disregard for water rights (unless they're asserting their own) and disregard for humanity and indigenous people.

Those within Nestle responsible for the most brutal and egregious of such behavior should be given a choice: shove crunch bars up their asses until death or drink massive quantities of water until water intoxication death....or at least until they get a feel for what they've done.

Fuck you
Nestle.

I hate all those claims of 'spring water' or 'bottled at the source...'

I just want clean water, if possible with bubbles and some citrus flavor. 

The idea of people putting a plant on something wonderful like a spring creeps me out. 
Can confirm water is pumped from deep aquifers. Springs  give water by gravity feed, I've spent many days hiking in mountian terrain where springs are common but none  will make a trailor load of water in a year  . 
Like I've been saying for years...I don't think it's a coincidence that "Evian" spelled backwards is "naive". 
people in maine despise nestle/poland sping

its definitely from springs though, in/around poland maine

edit: to all the dirty poor mainers replying to me, try educating yourselves, reading newpapers, idk. https://youtu.be/q8a2cbO2Ozc?t=1h22m54s

nestle pumps water basically for free from maine and then trucks it to other states, where it never returns to our watershed or aquifers. there has been lots of resistance, legal and otherwise. not going to try to explain why this is bad to peasant shits like you
Technically some of those water molecules are probably billions of years old so they probably came from a spring at some point in all that time. Maybe even several springs! They should increase the price.
I didn't know [Del and Rodney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature%27s_Son_(Only_Fools_and_Horses\) ) had moved to the US.
I bet it's not even from Poland
They should call it MOLAND spring... am I right??
I strongly suspect it isn't Polish either.
Fiji water next please.

I want to know how the water is untouched by man but gets bottled.
Dasani is filtered from Atlanta's water supply. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasani
Penn and Teller did this a while ago on their bullshit show. Most bottle water doesn't come from a spring or the mountains.
The bottled water industry is perhaps the most lucrative sucker market EVER.

Put a massive water pipe into a building. Get a large reverse osmosis filter and a bunch of plastic jug filling / sealing equipment. Find someone to do the marketing, then tap into the local water utility after figuring out where the water is sourced from.

Then spend a bunch of money on marketing insisting that the water people pay $2 a gallon for in the store is somehow better than filtering the water from your tap until Nestle or Pepsi buy your brand.

That being said if the brand claims to be spring water from Poland Spring it's false advertising.

Kind of like how Trump claimed to be a businessman with global experience. Technically true, even though it was only with Russia and countries willing to give him lots of money for a privately held corporation originally handed to him on a silver plate and subsequently run into the ground six times over.
I think you mean Moland Spring
Isn't all bottled water basically a scam? It's not safer or cleaner than regular water, bottles fill up landfills, and companies pull shenanigans to wreck local ecosystems.
Bottled water is such a scam. Giant transnationals get our water for fractions of a penny, then mark it up thousands and thousands of times. Tap water costs about a thousand times less than bottled water, and a lot more work is done to ensure its cleanliness and sustainability.
In Poland "spring water" usually means "destyled water", that's propably where the confusion comes from.
oh this is great. polandspring.com's faq source code commenting:  <!-- This will have to be removed when lawsuit hits-->

http://imgur.com/a/CVLRV
Wouldn't it be funny if because of this lawsuit Nestle employed one person to add one drop of spring water to each bottle.
Justin Trudeau (now Canada's Prime Minister) did a study in Canada about bottled water in 2008, here's the [link](https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2008/08/11/the_case_against_bottled_water.html) for it.

"As Pepsi was forced to admit last year, both brands take the water they bottle directly from municipal water systems; Dasani uses water from Calgary and Brampton taps while Aquafina uses tap water from Vancouver and Mississauga."
You think that's bad? Coke hasn't had so much as a milligram of cocaine in years. They quietly dropped it but kept the name the same.

If they would lie about that, what else are they lying about? Is Sprite not really made from [ly'mons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHMh8HUPLx8)? Is Dr. Pepper made with real doctors *or* peppers?

**How deep does this rabbit hole go?**
I'm sorry, but if you believed for a second that it came from a spring, I've got a bridge you might be interested in.

Mainer checking in as well. There is a factory in Buxton and I've also seen them pumping at a sandlot in industrial park saco. Still though my personal favorite when it comes to bottled water. Sucks when traveling south where they don't have it.

Edit: it's been pointed out to me the factory is in Hollis.
Can confirm. I live in Maine and see their trucks often sucking hundreds of gallons of water out of the [aquifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer) here.

WTF do you think spring water is???  spring water *is* ground water that typically pushes up to the surface on it's own, but can be pumped.
Well it's fucking amazing whatever they do to it.  I love Poland Spring.
Poland spring is still my favorite brand of bottled water.

Nestle is a steaming shithouse of a corporation. No one SHOULD like skeezy business practices but so many people seem to want to protect them for some reason. I don't get it. 
That means it's sweat from the brows of migrant workers that has been filtered through the purification contraption from Waterworld and bottled. 
Someone posted this in another thread a while ago. 

Nestle has something like 8,500 companies operating in over 80 countries. Blows my fucking mind.

Nestle has its strangle hold in my hometown in Canada as well...

Fucking bastards shipped in their employees to a town hall meeting to discuss Nestles application to increase their limit on withdrawing water to prevent actual concerned citizens from being able to attend.
Not in Flint Michigan.
Also - Spring water is the lowest quality form of (drinking) water.  Its literally water that has come out of the water-table and is now at the surface, and much more likely to be contaminated.  "Spring Water" should not be a selling point.

>A spring is any natural situation where water flows from an aquifer to the Earth's surface. It is a component of the hydrosphere.

At least in areas with the funding to do so.. Some rural areas are stuck with ancient piping systems that leech metals into the water
> regulated

but not necessarily more strictly filtered. 

It makes good sense, the legal requirements for tap water should be stricter than the legal requirements regulating some optional alternative.....

and the companies that bottle that water can choose to make it superior to tap water if they think that will make it sell better! Some do. Or not.... if they do the cost benefit analysis of that and decide the cost of extra filtering is not going to increase sales by enough. 
How come my strictly regulated tap water tastes fuckin' gross then?
and Torgo's Executive Powder
But are they really from Mars!

I really hope one of the first companies to set up shop on Mars makes candy bars. That kind of opportunity doesn't come around too often...
You would be wrong. They absolutely have a plant in Poland Maine.
Yes it is. Poland, Maine. That's the actual name of the town.
It's from Moland Springs

[Actually, surprisingly...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji_Water#In_Fiji) it does.
There is no coke in Coke either....stupid regulations. 
Fiji water is the only bottled water I find any value in. To me it tastes way better that all the rest. 
Not everyone knows this. 
That's why I make my own.
I was thinking the same thing about Mountain Dew.
Make fun of me all you want for having a preference in bottled water, but I always just buy a few cases  from Costco every couple weeks (I drink a lot of water). It was 2.99 for 40 bottles and to me the Costco brand tastes a lot better than the other "name" brands. And where I lived the tap water tasted like crap so buying bottled water was a very effective way to get me to actually drink it.
It's not basing this on the name. Read under the name: 100% natural spring water.
thats why ya gotta get the throwback bersion, its real dew and not some man made in a lab dew
It says "100% pure spring water" on the label. Mountain Dew doesn't claim to be actual dew from the mountains.
Mountain dew doesn't say "100% dew from mountains" on it
No corn liquor in it either.
It totally is condensation harvested from the tops of mountains.   

Source: Years of backbreaking labor harvesting mountain condensation for PepsiCo
When I was younger my uncle had me and my younger cousins convinced it was just deer pee, harvested from the mountains and carbonated.
Read the bloody label.  It says made with 100% spring water.  Mountain dew does not say made with 100% dew from mountains.
That sounds like more of a local government issue, if they're cool with cheap permits and pumping. Especially if they didn't do anything to stop it during a drought.

From a business standpoint, Nestle took advantage of a good deal. 

Still a shitty thing to do, but they want to make money. 
It's awful, truly, but let's be honest - blame is on the local government for allowing it, not Nestle for doing it. Businesses will do everything they *can*, that's why you regulate them.
They do the same thing here in Michigan, for less money and for almost quadruple the amount of water...

>Nestl√© Pays Only $200 to Take 130 Million Gallons of Michigan‚Äôs Water

It is honestly insanity. 
Drinking water is very, very far from the most wasteful use of California water. The state was haranguing residents to stop using water because it's politically paralyzed and unable to deal with the real problem which is locked-in commitments to deliver scarce water to farmers at extremely low prices, promoting wasteful marginal uses like growing alfalfa.
Yes but you are forgetting to factor in human laziness, people will always end up picking the easiest thing. 
Yea there was already a lawsuit over this and Nestle settled without admitting fault.  
Idk about this brand but in the UK there was a case in 2004 where Dasani water came was tap water bottled here in London
The idea that the water that seeps out of the top of the ground is somehow better than the water that you pull out of the ground is a bit ridiculous. There's nothing special and wonderful about a spring.
Research FDA's standard of identity for boreholes connected to springs and educate yourself. The industry is a little different than the spring catchments of yesteryear. 
[deleted]
Do we? I'm a Mainer and I've never noticed.
I hate what they did to Old Portland, basically a desert now. Same thing is happening to New Portland. 
So weird to see New Portland mentioned on Reddit. I grew up there, and remember them building that plant up in Kingfield.
They also end up stealing ground water from people who need to use wells. 
>Let if fill with water

That's called *leaching*. That's how wells work. But *leach water* doesn't sound appetizing. 
The water comes from a town in Maine called Poland. It used to have a spring. Now, Poland Spring water is just bottled tap water from Poland, ME, or from around that area. Personally, I think it tastes better than my local tap water.

Btw, Maine has a bunch of towns with international names, like Paris, Norway, China, Naples, Belfest, etc. 
Range Pond, it is just pronounced Rang...
I've peed in that pond.
Yup. Used to work there, they've got pipes coming up out of the lake on their side of the property
There is a field out in Buxton... with a rock wall. I hear there is something buried under a piece of volcanic rock, by some tree.
that's fun. There's a Buxton in Englad that is a spa town (have natural springs). And Buxton is a brand of bottled spring water.
I doubt that's what you're seeing.  Trucking water from a pumping station to a treatment plant would be wildly expensive.  We use pipelines for that, not trucks.

What you're seeing is probably Poland spring deliver trucks taking finished product to 7-11s.
Well.... It's usually water that seeped into the ground and has been filtered through clay and earth for sometimes decades or longer.  And when it comes to the surface again it is (comparatively) rich in local water soluble minerals.  

It has not been standing water so there are not dangerous bacteria.  You in don't need to boil it to drink it. It also has had most impurities from things like manure or human waste filtered out of it in the same way that charcoal filters work. 


Historically, spring water has been considered magically healthy for these reasons.  Because unlike other water sources, it's not harmful.   


Ground water being referred to here is runoff that entered the water table (sitting just below the surface).  It has not gone through many years if filtering, absorption, etc to exchange undesirable impurities for desirable ones.  It is often harmful to drink it without boiling or distilling it.  

Nowadays we have  purification systems for drinking ground water, so this distinction isn't as relevant.  


But they _are_ technically different things.


Edit: phones autocorrect randomly replacing words.
Shh let them think that spring water is some magical fountain of youth
wrong. there is a specific definition of spring water. it is not any old ground water that is pumped. it has to come from a spring or from the same stratum as a spring.

https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=165.110

"The name of water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth may be "spring water." Spring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice. The location of the spring shall be identified. Spring water collected with the use of an external force shall be from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. If spring water is collected with the use of an external force, water must continue to flow naturally to the surface of the earth through the spring's natural orifice. Plants shall demonstrate, on request, to appropriate regulatory officials, using a hydrogeologically valid method, that an appropriate hydraulic connection exists between the natural orifice of the spring and the bore hole."
They tried bottling it in October once, but the bottles kept falling over.
I dunno, OP sounds like management material to me. 
Becasue marketing thinks someone cares and will buy Iced Tea made with spring water over the ones that aren't.  I dunno.
Good point. Most people are led to believe that spring water is somehow inherently better than other water. However many of those same people probably couldnt even define what a spring is. Its just a point on the earth's surface that intersects the groundwater table... and therefore water comes out. Bottling companies actually just pump groundwater from an aquifer, and as long as that aquifer produces a spring somewhere around their well fields, they can legally call it spring water. However I guarentee that if bottling companies started putting "100% groundwater" on their bottles the general public would avoid it like the plague. Its just marketing strategies that work pretty well with the generally oblivious public.
Throttling your hydrobandwidth.

worse, comcast hasn't killed babies yet
Sadly they own most of the water you buy now. Even the 2 big ones from Italy and Germany are now owned by them.. I was saddened as I like sparkling spring water.. or as I call it pretentious water. 
Try boycotting Nestl√© AND Unilever. You might as well die of starvation. Almost. At least here


Edit for clarification: My country has very little competition. Most hygienic products are either Unilever or Nestl√© (they own like half of L'Or√©al so that's a thing..). 90% of icecream is either Unilever or Nestl√©. 

Sure, you can avoid their products but you then buy expensive "hippie cleaning products" and probably **eat less** due that. ~~Or get shit tier Parfume infested cleaning things and get dizzy.~~
I looked it up: [List of Nestle controlled brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)    
Only 8500 brands. :/
Fuck, I can't even say how many times i've gone for the more expensive Poland Springs bottles instead of the super cheap Nestle bottles and you're telling me I've just been giving EXTRA money to Nestle this whole time? Those motherFUCKERS
Trying is great though! Going from 10 products a week to 1 is huge. But what we are paying for is convienence. People hate to "suffer" nowadays and it's just pathetic. Do your best to limit products from Unilever and Nestle and be mindful when consuming any product. That's all anyone can ask for.
Do they have their hands in fresh fruit and veggies?
Your effort matters. Please don't assume it is futile. I hate when people give up on the Nestle boycott just because they have their hand in everything. Any boycott is an impact on their bottom line. So you can't avoid all 10,000 of their brands. Can you avoid one? Then avoid it. It's still one less source of income for them. Ten? Even better. More than half of their brands you probably don't even touch (regional limitations, lack of interest/need, etc.) with no effort. A little more effort, a little bit of effort from *everybody*, and it chips away.

You don't have to be perfect to have an impact. But, you do have to try.
Including pizza pie: http://www.nestle.com/brands/allbrands/digiorno
Just buy ingredients and not ready made food: Fruits, Vegetables, Nuts, Flour, Sugar, natural yoghurt etc.

You will be also eating much healthier. 
It's really pretty easy if you tend to cook for yourself most of the time and/or don't buy processed or sugary foods. I went through the Uniliver and Nestle Products list and it seems I don't actually buy any of their products.

The secret is to not give in to convenience. Want something sweet? Go to the bakery in another part of town as opposed to the convenience store down the street. Want a sugary beverage? Make your own (some, like iced tea, are surprisingly simple) or find some place that sells smaller-named brands like Boylan's or something comparable.

It really just takes minor changes in lifestyle (and some diligence) to remove these brands from your life. Most of their products are crap anyway. I'd much rather bake my own cookies than buy anything from Nestle's group of products anyway.

Edit: some word changes
Seriously. At this point, people who say to respond to unethical business practices by "voting with your wallet" are just ignorant. With these massive corporations owning virtually everything, voting with your wallet is an obsolete concept in many fields.
We MUST annex Poland by the spring!

And Nestle continues to buy more public water sources.
No need to apologize.

Nestle is headquartered in Switzerland but like every other western multinational it's owned and controlled by global investors. 

It's as Swiss as BP, Exxon, Johnson and Johnson or Coca Cola.
Everyone likes money. No one likes skeezy business practices except those who profit from it. And that's most likely not you or me or 99% of the worlds population so idk why you're celebrating.

Just to clarify for people: Spring water is perfect if you're stranded or otherwise without a reliable drinking source. Probably the cleanest water you can find in nature.

So I think OP meant to say "Spring water is the lowest quality form of *drinking* water."
 The vast vast majority of bottled spring water is not collected in the surface but pulled out of the ground using boreholes. 
The EPA considers springs to be groundwater, not surface water. 

A spring that is used for drinking water is diverted to a spring box underground, before that water reaches the surface. That water is then pumped from the spring box to a reservoir. The overflow from the spring box flows to the surface. 

Spring and ground waters do not have the same sort of contaminants or physical properties as surface water.    
Yeah. Flint Michigan isn't an isolated incident. Tons of towns do have pretty poisonous water.

It is, but you have to pay for it.  Treating water to be drinkable, and putting it into pipes to be delivered on demand to your house is not free.  Neither is treating the water once you poop in it and flush it down.
Who do you work for?
Do you think it is ok for Nestle to set up bottling plants in areas that have water shortages?
> By making that water more expensive as people use more of it, you cut down on the amount of water used for bullshit purposes.

Such as selling it individually in wasteful bottles for ridiculous profits based on the company's ability to buy [a million litres of water for $2.25](https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2015/02/24/Nestle-Pays-Nothing-to-Bottle-Water/).

There is **zero** chance that Nestle is paying the subsidies the general public would pay to protect water in any meaningful way. Apparently it's wrong for the public to overconsume but it's totally okay for a company to overconsume even as you directly acknowledge how ecologically dangerous it is.

I genuinely hope you get paid for the mental gymnastics you do here.

so what about when Nestle is taking water from drought-stricken areas, like they were doing in California?   http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36161580
But personal use of water is incredibly small compared to industrial use of water. I don't see this as justified to privatize water for us, the consumers.
How do you actually control for that though? They don't know what you're going to do with the water that comes out of your tap.
The funny part is the Nestle view is the best way to environmentally protect water sources. Make them unprofitable to access. Turns out the anti-corporate circlejerk on this site wins out over the protecting-the-planet circlejerk. People just want to bitch, not fix things.
No, it's not shitty. It's true. The government shouldn't subsidize the water you use to wash your car, you should pay the market rate for that. Otherwise people use too much water, which *is happening*.

Get busy livin'.....or get busy dying.
These are tanker trucks filling up with water at a pumping station in Fryeburg, ME before driving to one of three bottling plants in Hollis, Kingsfield or Poland, ME. Any time I drive anywhere in western Maine, I see at least five or six of these tanker trucks going back and forth from a pumping station to a bottling plant.

He is not wrong. I also live in Maine and it was discussed in the Bangor Daily News not long ago as this is a hot topic in Maine at the moment because they are building a new plant and water will have to be trucked in.
No, they do ship spring water in tankers at about 8,500 gallons a truck at least in Washington. I worked at a 3rd party labeling company for bottled water.
Can confirm, they pump the water into tanker trucks
Source: relative sold almost all bottling equipment in the US
They have water trucks full of water they pumped from other locations going to the Hollis plant all the time.
I live in a town in Maine that just sold our groundwater to Nestle. I also know  guys that drive those tankers to the bottling plants.

It's literally our towns water supply.
Soo when you say 'groundwater from runoff that entered the water table', do you mean water from an unconfined aquifer as opposed to cleaner water from an underground confined aquifer? Springs technically can be sourced from both types.. but it seems like the bigger problem was that the water in this case was being sourced from potentially contaminated areas. I do agree with the article though that the term spring is a bit ambiguous and, as a geologist, I've recognized that a lot of people seem to equate spring water with more pure water, which is not necessarily true. 
Exactly. People have a positive association with spring water that they don't have with ground water. Marketing companies are aware of this difference and definitely don't act as if they are both the same. That's why it's named Poland Spring Water not Poland Ground Water.
These puns aren't very seasoned. 
For people not in the US:
"They tried bottling it in October once, but the bottles kept autumning over"
Definitely belongs in Marketing. 
I'm not sure what offends me more.  The fact that somebody believes that, or the possibility that it might be true.
You might even call it a *bottleneck*.

Maybe they're just better at covering it up, I wouldn't put it past them.
Only because they haven't figured out a way to monetize it
It's funny how I kinda rolled my eyes at the premise of Quantum of Solace yet here we are.
they even want to buy out every water and claim it theirs, and that human being should not have born right for water and have to buy it. So for example you could not just come up to spring and drink. Would be against law. Which is ridiculous. Maybe I paraphrazed something but the point is still the same. They want to buy out everything.

No they own my favorite pizza :(
Hot damn!  I don't use any of their products!

But then I am retired and cook from scratch and have been making candy and cookies off and on since I was a child.

Not difficult at all to avoid them (Unintentionally at that!) if you have the knowledge, skill, and time to make alternates.
Yep. Read the back label when choosing a water. They own Aqua Panna, Arrowhead, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Poland Spring, and Zephyr hills, and that's just water. Chances are too that if you find a water not by Nestle, its by Coke instead. Moral of the story is get a reusable water bottle I guess? I've been trying that lately to get away from bottled water.
Luckily no, that's just Monsanto. 
Frozen are usually better (and fresher) than "fresh" unfrozen.  And I think Nestle has their tentacles in some frozen fruits.

Springs is plural. My town's water supply comes from a spring. The highest flow category for springs is at least 2,800 liters/s. That's 241,920,000 liters or 63,908,503 gallons a day.

You're being overgenerous.  Even when it's about water, the "unfairness" in most people's minds depends on whether it happened in a place like Flint, or a place like rural Kentucky.  
Yeah and for instance in my country you pay for water, but it's really cheap. Different from privatizing water and letting someone decide price.
It's a public right in America where the infrastructure exists and we pay taxes for that infrastructure to be built so we all have a right to it. The quality of said water tho.....

Extremely relevant in a post about **drinking water** but screw it the soapbox is set up already 

He's defending the quote, not the company.
You're completely missing the point. That's exactly what this guy is talking about--that water should be way, *way* more expensive. But it isn't, because it's subsidized. Corporations have a legal and ethical obligation to maximize shareholder profits, so that's what Nestle does. They set up plants in areas regardless of how it impacts environments. The fault, though, lies with California for charging Nestle subsidized prices for a good that has no business being subsidized.

Nestle can only get away with that because the price of water there is artificially low. If the price reflected the supply of water, which is *exactly what the Nestle CEO argued for*, Nestle wouldn't be able to set up a plant there. The water would be too expensive.

To be fair, the water is more than just hydrogen and oxygen, it's the blend of minerals and salts that give it a unique flavor. And Fiji likely has more water than they know what to do with.

In context, he says water outside of basic necessity and hygiene should be paid for. I agree.

This has been in the back of my mind everytime I go shopping. Kitkat?  Lion? Smarties? I love them all but never buy them because of Nestl√©. Fuck Nestl√©
Typical, bandwagoning on the incorrect stance. There's this thing called the "water cycle". It means if I water my lawn in the desert, if it evaporates, it returns to the cycle. This whole thing about droughts is mostly an engineering problem. We may have a finite amount of water, but each water molecule can be reused an immeasurable number of times. Water doesn't escape earth and into a void.
Water should be free 100% of all times ever because, like air, it's fucking available to anybody who consumes it. We need to be cleaning up areas and prosecute companies that TOXIFY the water so it can't be consumed, not worried about who IS consuming it. Nestle needs dismantled. I should have the right to consume any resource that earth provides that doesn't involve me trespassing.

Fuckin shills.

As soon as Comcast can figure out a way of killing babies to improve their profit margin, hoo boy, you're going to need a raincoat for the subsequent infanticide.
How do you think they make internet?  Sure you could wait until your town gets "baby-free" google fiber, but until then it's just Comcast.
But in QoS the plot wasn't even for *all* of the water, it was for, what, a third of the water supply? That seemed to be a good chunk of what got it some grief, that it was silly as a movie plot that cut the legs out from under the dramatic tension to have it be for only a portion of the water supply.
Pretty sure that plot was based on the the privitization of water by the Coca Cola company in South/Central America which is a very hot button issue. Nestle and Coke are two of the biggest offenders but by no means the only ones. I would suggest checking out the documentary World Water Wars, basically describes how water is becoming the new oil.
I remember them saying that. Such a dystopian idea, corporations like that are straight up kleptocratic greedy selfish fucks. Unbelievable that humanity allows people like that to exist. They should be removed from society.
Dumping mercury and using child labor in India for example.
Pretty much any large company is doing some unethical shit. Responsibilty is to shareholders first, everyone else second.

That particular Boycott isn't too difficult but Kraft has a ton of products I enjoy. If I threw in Nestle in the boycott I would basically have to grow my own food to survive.

I disagree. Private companies have a huge incentive to ignore/thrwart/fight against regulations: profit. Are there penalties? A better question is: are those penalties enforced? We've seen time and time again private companies wantonly disregard regulations and rack up penalties and still disregard them.
> If a private company violates regulations, there are penalties. 

That depends on the private company in question.
Yup. Especially acidic water ate away at the calcium later in the pipes that usually makes them safe enough to use. Then the lead was able to get into the water, especially fast since the water was corrosive.

I'm late to this party but as a hydrogeologist it's been amusing reading through the exchange.

To reiterate for anyone reading through the comments: any aquifer has the potential for contamination, and there's no assurance spring water is safe. Springs sourced from shallow, especially karstic, aquifers are easily contaminated, sometimes containing e. coli, nitrate, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants that can be traced back to human and farming waste. Springs can also come from deeper, confined aquifers, which around here means that at the very least they'll be saline, and can contain high levels of naturally occurring contaminants. 

There are also a lot of old, abandoned wells floating around making the whole shallow/deep, confined/unconfined discussion a bit irrelevant as these act as artificial pathways connecting aquifers. In some cases those "springs" you find are just that, flowing wells that have been abandoned and forgotten. Sometimes they were abandoned for good reason.

Water is generally safe(ish), but I'd still boil any water you find in your travels at a minimum. 
Every pun is a winter me

My girlfriend gets those big bottles of smart water or "pH balanced" and "alkaline" waters and big spring waters because they "taste better and are cleaner than our water" (we have nice clean well water) even though I always tell her it's all just tap water with fancy labels.

"This is definitely my water, it even smells better" ....aaaaaand it was our tap water lol. She still gets the other bottles though haha

Put one-quintillionth of a drop of it on your tongue, you'll never need to drink water again!
Your neighbor could water his lawn ten times a day and it would not put a dent into your local water usage. You have all bought into this lie about water conservation, industry and farming use 90% + all the water. Private use doesn't out a drop in the bucket. Weather you water your grass of not changes nothing other than your bill. One local golf course not watering their lawn would cover the five adjacent neighborhoods water usage for the year.
Does your neighbor have a well? If not, they‚Äôre probably paying for it
Thank you.  Too many people only have heard the snippet and have not heard the rest.  In a world where we have finite resources, we should not be so careless with water and allow something like your scenario to happen.
The issue is not water.  It is clean water.  It takes a lot of energy and resources to treat the water we use.  The water absolutely enters the water cycle, but it's not particularly easy to get back out and make fit for our uses.

You've also got a peak demand and geographic issue.  The water cycle isn't democratic in what it gives you back, or where it gives it back to you.  We build buffers into our infrastructure for that, called reservoirs, to localize our water resources close to where they are needed and provide protection against shortage.  That has a cost, and makes water a more scarce resource.

That's why watering your lawn in the heat of the summer in the desert is a waste of water.  Or growing almonds.  Or taking a 45 minute shower.

Your argument basically says - we shouldn't charge farmers for rain.  Which we don't.  But we should charge them for the use of clean water that we collect, treat, and transport.
Let's not forget about [the baby formula scandal in Third World countries](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards), where Nestl√© first supplied mothers with formula until they couldn't produce milk anymore and then charged them up the butt. Some mothers couldn't afford it at all, meaning their babies died of starvation, others could only afford a little bit and their babies died of malnutrition, and let's not forget that they mostly didn't have safe drinking water so they would mix the formula with some contaminated water which also caused the kids to die.

 [Or that they're still bottling water during the Californian drought on an expired license for next to nothing and selling it at $2/L](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36161580)

Not to mention decentralized companies. Coca-Cola US or Coca-Cola in Europe did not order for their south american branch to establish paramilitaries and perform human-rights violations.

small companies are just as bad and harder to hold accountable.

They paid to purchase the property, drill wells, use electricity to run the pumps, bottle, and ship the water, or if they were diverting surface water they would have had other costs.  They aren't operating on pure profit with no overhead.  Groundwater is usually considered a property right so you aren't paying the state to extract it, you own the land and you own the water (in many cases, not sure how it is everywhere).  I know California is really behind on groundwater permitting but in my state (Oklahoma) we do have a permitting process that sets an upper limit on how much can be taken out by each permitted user per year, which changes in each aquifer based on studies/models of each aquifer.  As long as you are within that amount, you can use it as long as it is for "beneficial" use, which selling it would count as.
So each of these 300 households use 120,000 gallons of water each year or 328 gallons per day?

Except in Portland Oregon they don't call it New Old Portland, they call it Gentrification.
The dream of Portland is alive in New Portland.  
Nice and voluptuous, I assume
And guess who owns Poland Spring? Yep, Nestl√©. 
they don't believe access to water is a human right.
yeah, I took a class in high school where we learned about various issues,  my project at the end of the year was to investigate bottled water companies and report their various practices. Every major water bottling company (nestle, Coca-Cola, Fiji, Pepsi, etc.) take their water from California tap water, and a lot of the major plants are in the areas that suffered the most from water conservation laws. I believe that those companies lobbied to get civilian water access restricted so their water costs would stay down. 
I was talking about here in Maine.

They tried paying for legislation which would have allowed them to charge people for having wells.

I'm a "groundwater professional" with 40+ years in the industry. The whole idea of "spring water" is laughable and I wish that the EPA, USDA, or some other alphabet agency would just do away with the term as it pertains to marketable water. This thread is a prime example of the misinformation, falsehoods, and general lack of understanding of what constitutes groundwater. I honestly have a guy that works for me (for over a decade) that barely has a clue. Fucking frustrating.


ALL SPRING WATER IS GROUNDWATER. ALL GROUNDWATER COULD BE SPRING WATER IF YOU COULD EXCAVATE AN AREA BELOW THE STATIC HEAD OR PIEZIOMETRIC SURFACE THAT LETS THE GROUNDWATER FLOW FREELY TO SAID EXCAVATION. surface)

Studies have found that 100% of people who drink water die.
^ This is absolutely true. Pollution output is similar. You and I do not pollute or use water or energy nearly as much as large corporations.
Okay now consider every person in a county doing the same thing. Local impacts are just as serious, wildlife doesn't know anything else. The pond near me is about to be ruined because the surrounding houses all got wells drilled after their water bills for watering their multiple acres during a record setting drought were too high. Don't take this as not agreeing, golf courses are disgusting, on that topic, what about the grass clippings? I know, I'm preaching to the choir. Hope everybody that reads this has a good day and doesn't stress too much about world issues.
Yeah, but this guy doesn't give a fuck about resources or  conservation. Nestle will suck a water table dry if it means more profit for them. 
Holy shit, when water finally gets privatized in the first world, you are all gonna regret what you said so much...
I can agree with your points, but nestle as a company, should not be making huge profits, by providing a human right. That's like saying nestle should start producing bottles of clean air to sell to people in Beijing. There is absolutely a line to draw of what a publicly traded company is allowed to profit from. Otherwise simply being alive makes you indebted to the corporate vultures. That's no way for a human to live. Nobody deserves it, and nestle playing their role makes them deserve sanctioning.
Yeah but there's at least a *chance* they're ethical. You can't get 1000 people together and have everyone be a good person. 
Idk, one lawsuit, fine, or a bad reputation and they're done for. A lawsuit or fine to a big corporation is often a slap on the wrist compared to their overall profits. 
Plenty of people grasp this concept. Plenty of people think it's a shit deal.
That's gold Jerry! GOLD!
Eh..not really a fair comparison. Many of those cars are vastly different...however several models are pretty much the same. Funny enough, GM shut down the brands that produced cars that weren't really shared across their other brands.
Saab was actually a different entity, as well as Hummer. That's like calling a Willys Jeep a Chrysler.
Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Saturn, and Hummer no longer exist, and GM sold Saab.  

But you forgot Vauxhall (UK) and Opel (mainland Europe).  Holden is an Australia-only thing.  

In any case, platforming is a major way auto makers actually make money: they can standardize a lot of parts, use unified sourcing and assembly for those parts, and then make differentiations in things that matter to the consumer (for example, Cadillacs getting better engines and interior trim, Buicks being a bit more experimental with new features that cost a lot).  
You ended that on the weakest note.  U mean Lays owns wavy lays?  Mind fucking blown, dingus
 especially if your team sucks. 
What about made in USA ^^China
Oh- the cool one, then.
> process that sets an upper limit on how much can be taken out by each permitted user per year

Yep. Mine is 1 million gal/yr

EDIT: Since I had a PM asking. Drilled a well. ~$30K. 1mil gal/yr is something no one household can realistically touch unless you had agricultural land (or a massive leak). Avg. US household is ~80-100gal/day which comes out to be ~29K-36K gal/yr.

Oh sure, "Studies have found".  #fakewater
So what you're telling me is, the water usage wasn't the problem, the problem was overcharging them for water based on this false premise - which then caused then to drill wells to get around the cost issue. That favors my argument, if anything. They didn't cause the drought, but were expected to pay for it. This only created more problems, because people aren't the cause of the drought.
Funny that people think Nestle is trying to be the good guy here. Wake up, they're not. 
The solution is to make the penalties scale with the companies profits. 

I believe all fines should scale with income of an individual or profits of a company.
I agree with this. His comparison is more like saying KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and others are all the same. They're just under one company (Yum)

I like how the regulator's letter says they "recommend" Nestl√© stop siphoning out over FOUR TIMES what they are legally allowed to take. You recommend? You can't say no?
I have an idea. Maybe a state with massive and continuous droughts shouldn't allow companies to export water from their state in the first place. I don't even understand why they have been ignoring it for so many years.
Nestl√© to California regulators: "No"
Hm? Telling someone to halt *unauthorized* activity? Ballsy. 
Looks like a job for the NCR.
Oh, that‚Äôs where my shitty gas station bottled water comes from!
Here's a novel concept people. Stop drinking fucking bottled water! Kills two birds with one stone. We will create a lot less plastic waste and these companies will have no reason to bottle it. Obviously sometimes people have no choice due to outages or contaminated water but most of the time we do! 
Nestles been doing this to the Great Lakes for decades
Dear nestle,

Hey! It‚Äôs us. Those Cali politicians again. So... funny story. We need to rattle the Sabers and look like we give a shit to get re-elected. Don‚Äôt worry. We don‚Äôt mean it. We have the authority to stop you but we would never do that. Just didn‚Äôt want you to worry. We still cool right?
              -california legislators 

 
I don't know how much y'all know about water in southern California other than the droughts, but we have a long history that goes back more than a century. In Los Angeles, we use water from over a hundred miles away, and every ounce of it drenched in scandal. I study dendrochronology in shrubs from the region we get our water from, as we are trying to see if the water sequestration caused their mortality. Water is a big issue here, and the research oppritunities for environmental science, geography and hydrology are plentiful at most southern Californian universities and governmental departments.

How is Nestles allowed to exist at this point. /rhetoricalquestion
[deleted]
Lol - this is why it‚Äôs entirely worth it for companies to exploit loopholes.  It takes governments years to get around to going through the steps necessary to stop terrible shit from happening.  And Nestle will most likely be able to continue once they file for an appeal.  And since Nestle started doing this, and the whole time since the story came out and the rest of the time that it takes for appeals to matriculate, they will keep being able to sell ground water for a profit.  


Nate Dogg and Warren G wouldn't have let this happen. 
Can we please start a movement to stop drinking bottled water? Yes there are some places and situations where it's the only practical answer, but for many of us, drinking bottled water is totally unnecessary. In Ontario, Canada, for example, tap water is perfectly clean. Drinking fountains are readily available, but bottled water sales are through the roof.

There needs to be a social stigma against it... Just like SUVs, smoking, etc. 
Hallelujah!! I signed petition after petition and I hate petitions. 
This will go nowhere.  California government has known about this for years.  They were probably complicit in the original agreement.  This is just some legislator rattling his/her saber to show what a great person he/she is and will use this action as a bullet point on the re-election campaign.   Meanwhile, if it gets through committee, Nestle will send in an army of attorneys, and after spending a couple of million on legal costs, California will drop the issue because they don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
The issue here is that they may not have proper permits for pumping the water.  So I'm guessing this isn't like Michigan where you can freely pump out as much water as you want as long as you dig the well yourself.
I remember the CEO of Nestl√© saying it maybe 5 or 7 years ago, that access to water should be removed from basic human rights. It was on front page of a lot sites. That's when I stopped buying anything Nestl√©.
Nestle is an evil company.  The CEO is actually quoted as saying that human beings do not have an innate right to potable water. And this is applied to third world countries in which Nestle is stealing water.

Would somebody please tell me why a self-proclaimed social activist like George Clooney is doing commercials for these scumbags?
Fuck Nestl√©...this is really the only company I actively refuse to buy products from. It's really easy to avoid them, join me!
In addition to Nestle's controversial water bottling practices, they have also had a lengthy history of questionable marketing practices with their baby formulas in third world countries going back to the 1970s. This is from an NYT article from 1981:

>Aggressive promotion of formula seems to have played a large role in the decline of breast-feeding, too, although its precise impact is difficult to measure. The companies which manufacture it argue that their promotions target only urban families who have the money to buy formula in sufficent quantity and the facilities to prepare it hygienically. And they insist that they tailor their advertising campaigns in both developed and underdeveloped countries so that formula competes only with local foods, not with breast milk. ''Breast milk from a well-nourished mother is a superior product to ours,'' says Harry Levine, a vice president of Bristol-Meyers. ''The biggest market is cow's milk, and that's what we compete against.''

>The companies have not always been surgically precise with their promotional activities, however. After surveying marketing practices in four underdeveloped countries during 1976 and 1977, the W.H.O. said: ''The distributors themselves reported that they were not limiting the distribution of products by either geographical or socioeconomic criteria.''

http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/magazine/the-controversy-over-infant-formula.html?pagewanted=all
I don't understand the problem.  Didn't they pay off all the right political people?  Guess Nestle has to drop a few more pennies into the "pay off" and graft system.
So nestle is only 5% raping a state in a water crisis? Oh my god they're angels!?!?!
Some direct action types need to destroy this and other water thieves (Cadiz for example) before they destroy the desert eco systems.  Just the idea that they think they can make a profit from extracting water from a desert is revolting.  
Nestle: Nah. It's cheaper for us to pay whatever measly fines you eventually hit us with than follow your rules. 
Remember the guy who got put in jail for collecting Rainwater, but Nestle gets away with murder
California golf courses use way more water than Nestle does and especially during droughts when citizens are asked not to water their lawns; those rules dont apply to golf courses.
I'm sure Nestl√© spokesman Dominic Greene was unavailable for comment.
Corporations:  "The State is an increasingly obsolete institution.  We will do as we please or we'll just pay people to replace you."
Wasn't one of the Nestle executives the specific prolapsed anus that said, "Water is not a human right"?

Or what? You gonna give them a fine thats only a fraction of the profits they made from committing the very act you're fining them for? I'm sure that's worked before. 
Nestle was in Michigan siphoning off our water for their bottled water. We told them to get the fuck out. They warned us it would take jobs with it, we said "NOW!". 

Europeans ruin their water then come running over here to steal our clean water. There should be a law against foreigners taking our natural resources. 
Fuck Nestle and their corporate greed. The CEO and rest of that den of thieves need to be removed. They are raping water sources everywhere.
Stop buying bottled water. 
Nestle has most likely bought off the California state legislature. 
Nestle is worst company of 2017 in my book. We need to crack down on them HARD.
Someone may have posted this, but there is an entire documentary about Nestl√©'s bottled water cash machine.

https://youtu.be/P0QH43DQLC4
Everyone to everyone else: Wait.  Why do we have to explicitly state that you can't have *unauthorized* water diversion? 
For perspective, they may pay $10 for water that is bottled and sold for $50,000.  They don't care about laws, court orders or fines when they are making nearly 500,000% profit.  They will have to be physically stopped.
nestle is also a primary supplier of hospitals. One of the most corruptly priced industries in the US.
Regardless of any potential environmental impact, there's this:

>The Forest Service, which does not charge a fee for the water, has been charging the company an annual permit fee of $624.

Nestl√© pays $624 for water that retails for over **$10,000,000**.  (2013 retail)

No court order, fine or law is going to stop them.
Shouldn't California just be able to make them stop, full stop?  I don't care about legal agreements and shit, it's California's water, not Nestle's.  I don't care what you pay, if you break the agreement, then there is no agreement.
This time they mean it /s. This would never happened unless Nestl√© had already greased the way with bribes. This is an empty charade for the benefit of the unwashed rubes. In California the wine is for drinking and water is for fighting over. Nobody just diverts that much fucking water without it being "paid for" in one way or another. How do I know this? I've lived in California all my life and seen how water has such a valuable comodity. My neighbors and I have banded together and filed a class action lawsuit in order to retain the rights to the water in our own wells. In some places people are forbidden from collecting the rain water that runs off their roofs to water their drought resistant landscaping. It's crazy. No way this just happened without a long standing unspoken (and illegal ) agreement with the government. Somebody blew the whistle and Nestl√© will end up paying some bullshit fine before we quietly go back to business as usual when the spotlight is off. TLDR: BULLSHIT!
So far, it look like Nestl√© might be still right, since they can't force them to stop. It most likelly mean that the initial deal was for "atleast X gallons/year" and not "up to X gallons/year". The authority know they fucked up, but won't admit it, so prefer to blame Nestl√© instead.

However, I'm against the destruction of the environnement.

If the gouvernement can not force nesl√© to stop, it mean the gouvernement did indeed gave the permission to nesl√©. They possibly can't do anything.
Yeah I live in Cali, we‚Äôve had about 3 days of rain this winter. We‚Äôre looking at another drought probably for the next two years.
Wow... how many years did it take for this to be said?

Probably just long enough for the bribes to wear off.

California regulators: "Halt unauthorized water diversions!"

*Nestle lobbyist hands over a bag with a giant dollar sign on it*

California regulators: "Did we say halt?  We meant continue! Unauthorized schmunauthorized!"


Please hit these bastards with a $50 billion fine, California.
California: ‚Äúnestle stop diverting water‚Äù

Colorado: (glances over at California) :Facepalm:
Not sure if I‚Äôm 100% right. But I think a big problem here in California is that companies like nestle have legal rights to areas with water that were claimed when the state was still being settled. 
The bottling of the water does not bother me but they seem to be taking an unrestricted amount and that does. 
Privatized water is one of the most evil things on earth. 
Nestl√©'s response: ***shrug***
...or we will send a strongly worded letter!
How does this compare to the massive amounts water used by other businesses, does it matter that other businesses don't actually remove the water from the area but just let it go down the drain? How much is lost to evaporation? And would that even be considered as a loss as it may return to the water table by condensation and rain?

Or, why is this different from a soda maker? Don't Coke and Pepsi also remove water from the manufacturing area? 

Why do people tend to single out a water bottler as opposed to a soft drink company? They are both basically selling water. Soda makers just add unhealthy ingredients first.
They should be jailed, not only being called out
If they took water they shouldn't, charge them what their customers pay for it.
All the water I was getting form Nestle smelt like sewage 
Canada also has the same issue with Nestle taking massive amounts of water for literal pennies.
Yeah go turn off the fucking tap and put cops on it 24/7.
Californian water rights are tricky though.  They are worded to grandfather in any amount of water used by a farm or industry in the prior year.  They actually disincentivize efficient usage of water because if you cut your water usage by 30%, next year you only get 70% of what you were used to getting.  It's a large reason as to why there are even some rice farmers in arid CA during a drought.  It's also ridiculous because during droughts, politicians make home owners stop watering their lawns to cut down on usage, despite residential usage only being about 6% of total usage.  Traditionally, you get your rights provided you have always been upstream of main usage.  So provided Nestle has always been taking drinking water from the streams or they bought the rights from a private entity that has always been using upstream at that rate, there really wouldn't be shit that CA could do without rewriting the law.  
[deleted]
I suspect because it isn't illegal or the regulators have no enforcement power. 
That's not how water rights work. The state doesn't own the water so they don't really have a say on this. Either the feds or someone else likely has rights to the remaining withdrawals and so there may be valid contracts. 

The state agency could take them to court and demand an injunction to get Nestle to stop over drawing on their claim until Its sorted, but then they'd have to show harm and that'll be a fight.
And you guys believe that you'll be fine without Net Neutrality.

Not to mention that one of their cash crops is a nut (almonds) that takes 1.1 gallons of water for just 1 nut.

The whole southwest should keep tabs on where that resource is going. The next 20 years is going to see a big difference in the value of water and they can‚Äôt be setting bad precedents with companies like Nestle.
[Nestle is trying to drain Pennsylvania now](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a44865/water-wars-nestle-pennsylvania/).  While PA does have more rain, it's also one of the last places with extensive primordial forest in the US.  On the upside, Nestle won't stand for the [flammable water caused by fracking](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/methane-migration/), so it might be one of those Godzilla vs Mothra situations.
Nestle does this all over the world. They bribe some people to get access to water then bottle it. In many cases the locals loose access to the water their ancestors used for thousands of years. Nestle is one of the most evil corporations on Earth and they are also not an American company. I heard about a deal with some native American tribes and they are really causing a lot of harm with how they get the water. 
> I don't even understand why they have been ignoring it for so many years.

bribery, but the thing about local and county politics is that you can actually show up and make a ton of noise about things you don't like and sometimes be heard. 
Despite all the bad PR, such a tiny amount is used by Nestle relative to the supply, effectively meaningless.

edit: Apparently there are [~42 million acre feet of water used for non-environmental purposes in California](http://www.water.ca.gov/swp/watersupply.cfm).  So [Nestles' 36 million gallons of water](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36161580) may sound big, but represents 0.00026% of CA's water use.
There used to be wild trout in lower waterman canyon all year 'round but Nestle stated diverting strawberry creek and other springs and there is no water or wild trout in waterman canyon anymore.
Because they got paid a lot of money. These small towns don't take a lot to buy, they're poor.
Because of money. 
Californian here. It's all about the money, just like everywhere else in the states. If a company wants something, they'll get it with enough greasy bribe cash. The sad thing is how little it took to buy the players who pushed this through and made it happen. 
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.
I don't get this, why do water bottle companies even exist in this time frame considering water is running out at a fast rate? Export billions of gallons out of the US while draining actual water thats needed for food, veges, and such..Wouldn't be surprised if water became the new oil, then we start raping countries for their water supplies if any.
Come on. It‚Äôs not like LA was built in the middle of a desert or anything. 
But I assume beer is still ok? 
Rights is a legal term.  Not enough water is a physical real-world problem.  Fix a real world and its cheap.  To fight over "rights" will require lawyers geting paid millions.  Unless water, or the people who depend on it, can pay those lawyers to fix the "legal" issue no one can fix the real issue.
Short answer...corruption.
But the artificially worsened scarcity will increase prices! It's wealth creation! We're creating value here! Gosh, don't you people understand even the first thing about economics!? Fucking plebs. /s
It makes almost no sense to me as to why many major water bottling companies go to the California desert to drill up groundwater. So much potable water in the East Coast and somehow it's still cheaper to drill in the desert?
$urely there mu$t be a rea$on they would do that.
Legal bribing

Lobbying
I have a different idea. Let corporations maximize profit with no regulations and the wealth will "trickle down". /S
This seems INSANELY obvious and it's really weird to me that it's not a bigger deal. 
Nestle is old and powerful, as powerful as oil companies and bankers. What they did to Michigan water supply is pure evil compared to CA. Just saying!
just a wild guess, but im pretty sure it has something to do with people being bribed 
> I don't even understand why they have been ignoring it for so many years.

It's called bribes and corruption. Corporations rule.


Yeah, and it only took them 10 years to act on this, so maybe you're wildly logical idea will be implemented in 2027.
Brings too much money to the state.  California doesn't want Nestle to move
"Just fine us pennies on the profit we'll make from it like usual, if you even have that much authority."
California: We did all we could do to stop them. *trips over bag of Nestle branded money*
You can't do that to us, we're Nestle! As a big company,surely we deserve the water. Now run along,shoo!
Not telling.

Kind of asking.

A friendly recommendation really.
It's bad enough we already lost the dam, now this "Nestle" tribe is trying to take our water? Almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter.
Or the Legion?
Yeah because those small water bottles come hella cheap.

As an older Redditor, I'm amazed that corporations have actually made water a very profitable commodity.

They'll be selling the next generation air, and none of them will find it strange. 
Not only have we stopped drinking bottled water, but we've stopped buying Nestl√© products all together. You'd be surprised how many food products they own, as well.

This means no more Stouffers frozen meals/lasagnas, hot pockets, certain cereals, candies, drum stick ice creams. Kind of a bummer, to miss out on all of that, but oh well. 
Here's the issue with not drinking bottled water: my tap water tastes like asshole. My pipes are all 40+ years old. I can't afford to redo all thr plumbing in my house.
Thank you!
Tell that to the people of Flint and however many other towns across America that still got poison pipes
Nestle has a legal right to the water the draw from the Great Lakes basin. Michigan common law permits usage of water residing under a party's property. You can argue what Nestle is doing in Cali is illegal, but they're simply using the water they already own in the Great Lakes basin.

Also, most of the water bottles in the Great Lakes in consumed within the basin, and therefore flows right back into the great lakes.
This exactly. I think it's time for the public to rattle some sabers at the politicians. 
The City of Los Angeles is still the biggest landowner in Inyo County. Half the commercial buildings in Bishop are actually leased - the landlord is the LADWP.

Whoever designed the scheme are legal and political (evil) geniuses. The City of Los Angeles has a chokehold on properties in the Eastern Sierra, making the residents dependent on the city for shelter and commerce. Not only that, the city can effectively stifle development in that area, keeping the region's tax base and political influence perpetually low.

Inyo County gets much of its municipal water from ground sources, refusing to use DWP water. Yet much of this water relies is in the Owens River basin - and the city controls much of the river's flow. They probably can't nuke the water table, but they can make residents pay heavily if they choose.

The more I read about it, the more awed I am at how neatly designed the whole scheme is.
Cadillac Desert is a great read that details the land development and water policy in the western United States. I definitely recommend checking it out. Pretty mind blowing at times.
From a certain POV, LA shouldn't have been built in the first place. The Otis-Chandler families conned the feds into dredging the port so the city would have a source of income and piping in fresh water from the Colorado River and Sierra Nevadas. If left without those things, the city would have been abandoned decades ago.
Check out Lake Cahuilla, the Alamo Canal, and O.M. Wozencraft! California has a dark and incredibly irrational water monopoly.
As a fellow Californian I applaud your efforts. Thank you. 
It's not really about Nestl√©.

Every fucking corp would have done the same if there were profit and they saw the opportunity first. 

Palm oil, over fishing, OGM monopoly, the Nestl√© water case is nearly irrelevant but somehow got a lot of attention (Especially because their main US competitors fear them and want the public to hate them hard.)

Where did you think all these infos came from ? :)

I agree. Some places you can easily filter water too- people would can get safe to drink water from the faucet or from a filter probably shouldn't be ignoring that for buying water. I know there was a time that was brought up and people were touchy like "but think about places like Flint! They need it! Don't take their water away!" At the mere suggestion of reducing bottled water... Of course it's not about taking water away from people who need it, but still reduce it for people who don't
You're rejoicing for a letter recommending Nestle stop stealing water?

A *letter* ***recommending*** Nestle stop stealing water.

Hallelujah for when the National Guard deploys to put a stop to it.  Nah, we'll see a fine that doesn't even begin to cut into the profits they're making on illegal water.
Does the company drilling the well have to do any studies on environmental impact or follow any guidelines to proper drilling techniques or can anyone do it?
We have had a few go arounds with nestle and other bottlers.
Dude, Nestle is the hardest to avoid of them all. They own 8500 brands in 80 countries.
They are everywhere.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands
To say nothing of the persistent rumours of child slave labour in their coco supply chain
Yes Nestle is top 10 most evil company on Earth. 
No, misinterpreted comment.  
Water is only a human right for crops, hygiene and food. Anything else is a waste and should be paid for.
California water agencies and rights holders:  "Be a shame if someone were to saddle you with lawsuits"

but that could be aimed at anyone.  
Financially, Silicon Valley could chew Nestle up and shit it out for compost, so a simple bribe is unrealistic. 
Pepsi, AB Inbev, Unilever and several of other international beverage companies have recently been reported in studies by JP Morgan to be amongst the worlds largest corporate water wasters, along with Nestl√©. Naturally, the biggest beverage companies are bound to cause the greatest water waste, but this doesn't exempt them from responsibility for their waste and it doesn't exempt their enablers at the government and consumer levels. New laws are needed and oversight to thwart new greedy corporate well drilling deals for the wasteful companies who seek them, instead favoring the companies that can prove water usage is sustainable. Consumers need to be made much more aware of the extent of government oversight of corporate water waste (or the lack thereof) and also of their own waste from bottled water and sugary beverages. The EPA has been largely deconstructed and its abilities vastly reduced from its prior state under former presidencies. If the current pattern of executive orders from the Trump administration continues, the EPA will no logner be able to conduct the impact of water waste.
The problem is that they are using more than they are allowed to use. If the other companies do the same at the rate nestle is then they‚Äôll get called out too.
>Or, why is this different from a soda maker? Don't Coke and Pepsi also remove water from the manufacturing area?

There is no difference. 
They can‚Äôt. Nobody is sure how Nestle‚Äôs rights work. They could be valid. They‚Äôre probably not or Nestle has done what it‚Äôs wanted to and taken liberties to interpret the wording in their favor. 
They do the same thing with most federal budgets.  "Oh you didn't need all of your funding this year?  Let's reduce it next year!"  So no one is honest in their reporting and services just spend all their money every year so it doesn't get reduced. 

Yay for 5000 ballpoint pens convienently purchased at the end of the fiscal year!! /s
Well put. Ive been protesting the pressure put on residential use during times of drought as marginal or downright futile. On a good day if everyone saves water at home it doesn't go past the teens. 

 Its all mostly commercial and agriculture.
It's the same stupid that's all over US government and laws. Why does the govt waste so much money? Because if you don't use up your budget and ask for more they'll cut your budget and never let you increase it back when you actually need it.
California also made it so you have to request water at restaurants.

As a Californian and a tree-hugging hippie, that's stupid bullshit. We need to stop wasting all our time on the 0.0000001% of the problem, and focus on the main issue. We have grapefruit groves in deserts that you can see from space.

We're strangling our ecosystem to have extra rice and avocados. Should we have water-wise landscaping with succulents instead of grass? Hell yeah, it can look really nice, too. But that's not the problem.
"He-hey, g-guys? G-guys, seriously, li-listen to me. Co-could you just, y-you know, please d-don't do this? It would be n-nice if you di-didn't break the law. T-thanks, guys."
Meanwhile it takes less than a week for the lawsuits to hit Apple after the public loses their shit over battery slowdowns. Priorities. 
> That's not how water rights work. The state doesn't own the water so they don't really have a say on this

That's exactly how water rights work. Water is owned by the state, not the federal government. Companies, counties, and municipalities buy and license water appropriation rights from the state. 
Can you back that up?  My understanding is that the state water boards do indeed have jurisdiction over water diversion. Not the feds.
The govt massacres striking workers but can't figure out how to get nestle to stop taking water. Hmmmmmmmmm
No one fucking thinks that. 
Which guys?
Isn‚Äôt the American dream is a house and two cars?
Yeah maybe your way and dream but not everyone in the US wants to be NESTLE that's just absurd to even assume.
There‚Äôs a book about that!

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Water_Knife
I think of all states, California would be worried about water rights... don‚Äôt they get a large majority of their water from other states? Like 50% or more?
[82%]( http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-california-almonds-20140112-story.html) of the world's almonds are grown in CA.

[CA also leads the nation in 66 types of fruits and vegetables]( http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-calcook-california-its-whats-for-dinner-20140312-story.html).  And grows virtually all the nation's almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, raisins, kiwifruit, olives, clingstone peaches, pistachios, prunes, pomegranates, sweet rice and walnuts
I hate seeing this posted because it shows a lack of understanding of just how much water it takes to grow any food. A single orange requires about 13 gallons of water. A dozen eggs taken over 600 gallons of water to produce... Almonds are actually pretty efficient in relation to the amount of protein we get out of them. It's estimated that it takes 200-1000 gallons of water just for enough fruits and veggies in a 2000 calorie diet every day. This doesn't include dairy or meat products. Seriously, almonds are not the antichrist. Gizmodo did a great article on this a couple years back:

https://gizmodo.com/seriously-stop-demonizing-almonds-1696065939

If you want to be upset about a particular crop being grown in California, it shouldn't be almonds. It should be alfalfa. I'm sick of this trope being spread around reddit, it's one of the worst ones.
One pound of beef uses 2500 gallons. Some of these agriculture stats are mind blowing.
Funny you blame almonds and are silent on beef
Well you really can‚Äôt  grow almonds any where else in the US due to climate. The real crazy things is we farm beef and dairy cattle in CA that would do just as well in a ton of other places in the US and also use exorbitant amounts of water. 
Isn't this a little sensationalized? It's not that the water used to grow the almond is gone forever. A lot of of it evaporates eventually and rains down again, although not necessarily in California. 

California has been experiencing droughts for a very long time. Even though the population has doubled since 1979, there have been very few new water projects. They have been blessed with fertile land but not enough rain.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_in_California

I also drink a gallon of water after I nut
not many people understand the water per fruit statistics you speak of but they are VERY relevant in today's world.
Can someone ELI5? That sounds unbelievable. 
1.1 gallons to grow one nut? what the fuck. TIL?!
That's nuts
Be interesting to see how many almonds make a pound but it takes around 500 gallons for 1lb of beef. So its not like meat is this big water saver. 

I'm sure 1lb of almonds is more water then 1lb of beef but its not like a landslide
It takes roughly 50 gallons of water to make 1 gallon of almond milk. Conversely it takes 4 gallons of water to make 1 gallon of cow milk. 
Thank you for that, I had not even realized the impact almonds made.

Edit: now I'm laughing at y'all salty people downvoting me for being polite. How could this comment be controversial?
It takes twice that for a pound of meat
So a company like Nestle is allowed to have such control over water that it can now bully whole states and countries?
True. They'd love it if water was a commodity, not a right.
Just out of curiosity (you are very accurate, though the article also mentions one stream has been reduced to barely a trickle) what if the same amount of water was instead used to water areas suffering from drought? Could it possibly prevent forest fires and save the fertility of the land?
[deleted]
No love of Nestle here, but the biweekly anti Nestle rants on Reddit are ignorance on parade. It‚Äôs literslly a drop in the bucket. And the waste is the water bottle not the water. Each gallon of water is water someone else drinks somewhere else rather than from another source. 
So stealing is okay. That's what you're saying? Taking resources for profit from those that own it is fine?
This.

The anti Nestle shit is so widespread I feel like I should be in r/conspiracy talking about big agro.

Agriculture is the problem. It's not Nestle. It's not lawns in Riverside. It's not our environmental conversation policies. It's the wasteful agriculture watering systems which piss away an estimated ten fucking percent of our water supply.
It's not. We have a Mediterranean climate. the desert is on the other side of our mountains. But when the Santa Anas blow we can feel the desert winds, which unfortunately helps cause our fires.
Probably because it wasn't built in the middle of the desert.
To be fair, I live in phoenix, middle of the desert, and we sit on top of one of the largest aquifers in the world
I mean, that's a given. How else would we cope with all the problems?
This is where a cease and desist order enforced by a SWAT raid comes into play.

Crazy to think that i eat almost nothing premade. I don't even know what stofuers is. 
I always post this when I see someone talk about a food industry boycott. You're still eating their food, you just don't know it. Nestle makes soups, sauces, flavor bases, food for the military, food for institutions, and food for restaurants. Don't eat out or eat small, private label brands because the big food companies have their fingers in there. Now they're all starting to buy up small, boutique vegetarian and small speciality food and beverage companies to pick up those who don't want processed foods as consumers.

All we have to do is stop drinking bottled water. Simple as that.  
Inyo County killin ur wells 
Same conclusion made in [Cadillac Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Desert). Some supporting info about Colorado River:

> Some of the world‚Äôs largest rivers do not reach the sea. In the
wake of economic development of the communities along
rivers comes an increase in water consumption that depletes
the rivers of their reserves. At the extreme end of the spec-
trum, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya‚Äîtwo major rivers in
Central Asia that feed the Aral Sea‚Äîhave been deprived of
close to their entire water reserves for cotton irrigation. The
Huang He (Yellow) River in China did not reach the sea on
some days in 1972‚Äîor for seven months in 1997. The
Colorado River in the southwestern United States and the
Indus River, between India and Pakistan, are two of the many
other rivers in a similar predicament.

Less relevant, but still relevant...

Falling groundwater:

> India almost half of all irrigated areas depend fully or partly
on groundwater. In China more than 2 million pumps irrigate
some 9 million hectares (Postel 1999). In the United States
one of the world‚Äôs largest groundwater aquifers, the Ogallala,
has been developed through privately financed wells feeding
sprinkler systems. While groundwater irrigation has con-
tributed substantially to the world‚Äôs food production and pro-
vided farmers with a dependable source of water, it has also
led to massive overuse and falling groundwater tables. A lack
of regulation of this common resource, combined with sub-
sidised diesel fuel or electricity for the pumps, gives farmers
an incentive to use groundwater as if there were no
tomorrow.

Low-income market for high-priced water demonstrates a critical public failure:

> Consumption of bottled water in Mexico is estimated at more
than 15 billion litres a year, almost doubling between 1992
and 1998, and growing by 35% in 1996 and 1997 alone. In
the United States the bottled water market is worth about $4
billion a year, and in the Pacific Northwest the dollar turnover
of this ‚Äúother‚Äù water sector rivals that of piped water. A large
share of the unserved urban population in many developing
country cities has to rely on water vendors who supply water
by truck‚Äîwater of unreliable quality that costs 10‚Äì20 times
more than piped water (box 2.2). This market for high-priced
water bought by low-income people demonstrates the
failure‚Äîor at least the poor performance‚Äîof the subsidised,
unaccountable, publicly owned water supply model.

Freshwater habitat already permanently destroyed:

> Worldwide, 20% of freshwater fish are vulnerable, endangered, or extinct;
20% of threatened insects have aquatic larval stages; 57% of freshwater
dolphins are vulnerable or endangered; and 70% of freshwater otters are
vulnerable or endangered. About 75% of freshwater molluscs in the United
States are rare or imperilled. With the possible exception of North America
and parts of Europe, nearly all inland fisheries show signs of overexploita-
tion. Cichlid fisheries in Lake Victoria have been replaced by Nile perch
catches, but many of the endemic cichlids are extinct. Many stocks of
salmonids in western North America have been lost.

So, lead? otherwise I guarantee your water is fine to drink. Even still, it is almost certainly safe.

Yeah, but turn the product and it shows the Nestl√© logo which is easily recognizable. Good they don't produce anything unique, so there are plenty of shitty, but less shitty alternatives.
You can still do damage even if you can't avoid them 100%. Just make a note of a few types products you buy frequently (frozen pizza, candy bars, whatever) and just don't buy Nestle's version. You don't have to memorize the whole list, just the things you buy most.

You say that like the child slave labor accusation is so much worse than the teen slave labor and the adult slave labor they admitted to using.
What are the other seven, besides EA and Bank of America I mean.
Former Nestl√© chairman, Peter Brabecke's comment was not misinterpreted, he was merely able to successfully whitewash his comment, which is avaialble for public interpretation at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brabeck-Letmathe#Views_on_water_charges), for the sake of posterity, the most damning statement of which reads as follows:

> "It‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion, **which I, [Peter Brabecke], think is extreme**, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. 

So, according to Peter Brabecke, NGOs "bang on" about an "extreme" view that water is a public right. Fuck Peter Brabecke! He goes on further:

> That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value."

How the fuck is that extreme? It's only extreme when there's not enough fucking water and corporate shitheels are grubbing every drop.

He added further:

> "Personally, I believe it's better to give a foodstuff a value so that we're all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water."

Great, this actually  might make some sense! The people who can afford it should pay, and they do! I pay about $70/mo. for my own public water bill. If Nestl√© wants to charge me for it, then fine, as long as it's fair and they stop wasting water so they can donate more of it to the starving people of the world, but it's never enough and the greedy execs just get richer with their tax sheltered banks as they seek out new natural [water sources](http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/10/oregon_scraps_water_rights_dea.html) to pilfer and new [acquifers](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/zn85qw/a-look-into-nestles-controversial-water-bottling-business-in-canada) to drain. 

Brabecke made no attempt to clarify his condemnable words until a lot of hysteria on social media about his remarks, when he finally tried to pretend it was all an error and that he does believe that water for basic hygiene and drinking is indeed a human right. Good, if he's being sincere, but he doesn't explain how any of it was taken out of context. Further, all of the context is plainly visible in the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyAzxmN2s0w). In the video, Brabecke is groomed and well dressed, within the comfort of his own Swiss office, which clearly gave him ample time to thoughtfully plan his words before the production. If there was an argument for a doctored film or a mistranslation, perhaps Brabecke could be forgiven, but his only complaint was that his quote was taken out of context, which is clearly not the case, as there is a *ton* more context of his own words from the same interview the video to prove otherwise. For the umpteenth time, I just now watched about five minutes of the interview from which these quotes were extracted, without any apparent cuts that might make these quotes less meaningful than they were intended by Brabecke himself.

By the way, I'm out of work right now. How much does corporate shilling pay?
I live in the mountains where this is happening. Everyone knows how nestles rights work and that's why you won't find a damn bottle of nestle water on that mountain. They're downright crooks and they're fucking up a delicate ecosystem that had existed prior to their water diversion. Not to mention all the fucking wildfires in the area, the hills are drier than dried leather in Death Valley yet these corporate fucks bring their Arrowhead bottled water trucks up to the  spigot at the base of the mountain and keep pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping as pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping and it needs to fucking stop 
Welcome to the age of corporate facism. 

Just do it and let Nestl√© sue them. Cities/towns do more idiotic things to get themselves sued everyday. Then Nestl√© would have to prove in court how their rights work. On top of that they would also have to create a PR nightmare by proving damages which would just show how much everyone is getting screwed by Nestl√©.
Citizens need to get armed and start defending their water. 
Fuck Nestle
And that's a fault on whoever wrote the contract with them.  Someone got paid off to write their water rights contract to be that vague.
> They can‚Äôt. Nobody is sure how Nestle‚Äôs rights work.

Isn't that the freaking job of the government?
As someone who deals with water diversions, wells, and water rights it is apparent that they don't have much of a claim to stand on. They are using the incompetence/greed of the State Water Resources Control Board. To clarify, it sounds like the water rights are for the hotel, not the bottling of water. Now they mentioned the use for bottling of water in 1912, before the 1914 water right claims cutoff date, but for this to work they would need to provide the amount claimed used for that amount at that time and they would be stuck to that. Any increase or difference in use would require a new water rights claim. Also, if the current diversions are located out of the watershed that the orginal claim was for, then that would also require filing a new claim. The environmental groups and their lawyers should pick me up on the team, that or Nestl√©, heh.

Such behavior is also standard practice within large corporations.

Damn it, Morty! >Belch< The Universe is a chaotic place, you gotta force it to make sense. 
Private versus Government.

We don't have as much red tape in the way.
Because anyone can file a lawsuit against anyone else. This isn't comparable at all
Because that's a simpler case involving consumers and a product they purchased, where the fuck do I even begin to sue Nestle over their water rights in California?
The state does not own, ie have property rights to all of the water in the state. The state has regulatory power and administers rights but water rights are a property right like mineral rights and can be bought, sold, or mortgaged. 

California uses the [prior appropriation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior-appropriation_water_rights) doctrine when it comes to water rights. Hell, they invented prior appropriation. Basically, the first in time first in right. 

Here we havr an even more complicated issue. This is a state agency trying to regulate water coming off of a federal national park. Do they even have jurisdiction? Water law is a mess.
The state water board is given jurisdiction over the water rights and navigable water ways in California. California can only exercise its jurisdiction where the state has jurisdiction. Within Federal National parks, will they have jurisdiction? 

The National Parks service and BLM have jurisdiction over the Federal water rights.
When? Like 100 years ago? And by the government you mean hired private detectives (Pinkertons) and local sheriffs? 

This is the first step in the process. Theyre basically putting out a cease and desist order, unless they have the right. The problem is, no one knows what right Nestle actually has to springs. Sure they may have only bought 27 acre feet but they may have leased other rights from other people. 

As an aside: Remember When coal workers struck in 1901? Federal troops called in. No massacre, but the troops mined. The companies didn't want to deal and T. Roosevelt threatened to rationalize their mines if the owners didn't reach a deal. A deal was met.
Seriously. Haven't seen anyone on reddit but t_d that is against NN.

It‚Äôs an ironic post. America is extreme in its corruption.
I loved the novel, but the non-fiction it references about the history of water and water rights and what may come, titled [*Cadillac Desert*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Desert), is almost more interesting, and scarier.
Oh man I hated reading this book. But it is somewhat informative. 
I always get nervous knowing that a lot of our eggs are in that one, drought-ridden basket.

If California ag dries up and our trade deals go to shit, get used to corn.
Dont forget Gilroy CA, also known as the Garlic Capital of the world.
The almond thing was some backroom deals that no one was expecting when the water started flowing from North to South it was put in the ground for "storage" but it turns out the location of the ground water storage was where the almonds are growing. Those almonds use stolen water because of crooked deals decades ago. It is slowly getting fixed.
I always thought SC produced the most peaches so I looked and it up and not only are you right, but you they produce almost 8x more
This is why, if oil is a precious resource we pipe from source to port, I think we should increase the water we pipe to California to fill its needs to grow our food, especially as droughts in CA increase in severity and duration. Insuring a nation‚Äôs food supply is bulletproof is something a rational, non-corrupt national government should do.
What bothers me is we produce a sizeable amount of the nation's food, yet we get zero compensation or help with our water shortage problems which we end up having to pay higher utilities for.  Our water and our economy get exported to prop up all the worthless welfare states, who then bitch about socialism
> of the world‚Äôs almonds are grown in CA?

Uh, 1%? 50%? _All_ of them? Don‚Äôt leave us hanging like this!
Has anyone grown the hardy almond trees you see in catalogs?  I live in MA and want to know if they are actually viable in my area.
Why are we growing so much of our food in a state with increadible droughts when we pay farmers in states that get plenty of water not to grow anything. That don't even make sense.
I don't really mind California being the nations leading provider of several crops given the sheer size of it. But being nearly the sole grower of all those things, now that's a scary thought.
A typical hamburger takes like 900-1300 gallons of water.  

Rice gets a bad rap too in CA due to flooded fields, but the farmers of those fields sell the water once harvest season comes off. Some of that water is transferred to Almond, Olive and Walnut farmers. 


Yeah seriously, it takes most people 6 gallons of water just to poop and another 20 to be clean...daily! 
can you please give link or explain how 12 eggs takes 600 gallons of water to produce? i assume they use water more than just drinking, but if a bird layed an egg every other day they would need to be drinking almost 30 gallons daily to hit that mark....
Of those food you mentioned, they produce much more dietary nutrition than almonds. Almonds are a great micro nutrient, but they aren't as important in daily life as the others.
You need to compare weights a single almond and an orange are not really comparable without. So I'm using Google for the weights and you/this thread for the gallons and putting it in a nice efficient g/gal. Almonds are 1.2g each and oranges are 140g each. The almond gives us 1.09 g/gal while oranges give us 10.77 g/gal not taking nutrition into effect oranges are more efficient by a factor of ten. For eggs I used the minimum weight for large eggs(56.7g) in the US and we get 1.13g/gal. Almonds are not efficient here either. But you said they are efficient in amount of protein so let's do that math(sadly oranges and almonds don't count here). So protien in a single almond is .3 g. Which means we get .27g of protein/gal. So again large USDA eggs we have 6g of protein. Converting that over we get .12g of protein/gal. Almonds do win here. One more I saw in this thread 660 gallons of water per burger. Burger is 120g per Google so that gives us .18g/gal. Almonds are better. There are 20g of protein in that burger. Which equates to .03g of protein/gal. Again almonds are better. I'm neither defending almonds or supporting them. I'm more getting rid of the bad units used to compare things. Obviously an orange is going to use more water than an almond it's way bigger. The amount of water each use without the weights is useless. It makes things seem better or worse with out showing it.


Edit I got the burger water amount from a Huffington Post headline. The number in this thread was bigger meaning it may be smaller than it already is. Obviously this is quick math meaning there maybe mistakes.
A big reason almonds are demonized is due to almonds grown in the high desert. Water used to grow crops in the Central Valley goes back into and replenishes the water table. Because of the geology of the high desert the water used settles and becomes unusable brine, there‚Äôs no natural system recycling the water. 

I do agree cutting back on growing alfalfa and moving to a more plant based diet would provide a huge benefit to water and environmental needs. 
Ok but I'm definitely eating a lot more than 13 almonds per orange that I eat. The dozen eggs seems pretty steep though
It‚Äôs worked for the oil industry for decades. Why not nestle?
Nestle has been trying to take water rights for years, they hate that you have cheap water at home. Terrible company.
It's funny you say that, because a chairman of Nestl√© came out years ago and said that he didn't believe access to water was a human right.
One of the things to keep in mind about this region is that preventing forest fires is probably not the best way to handle our forest fires and brush fires.  Keeping these areas watered is probably counter productive.  

Managing fuel with things like controlled burns are probably a better way to go about dealing with the fire issue.
No. Not even close. If you used it just on the land that has burned this year, it'd be 71 gallons an acre.


Based on the link I provided the swing in supply between wet, regular & dry years is absolutely massive and the amount used by Nestle is effectively meaningless in the scope of things.  

Drinking water strikes me as not the place to look for water waste, bottled or otherwise... my guess is some folks out there just have it out for nestle for some reason so this storyline keeps getting picked up.
Yes you chould actually (except for the golf course. Who the hell owns a golf course?). All those campaign about saving water was bullshit, the amount of water a domestic user could save is tiny. But powerful agricultural lobby is powerful.
i get that reading can be difficult but he didn't even imply that it's okay to steal
That's not what he's saying, I think he's just pointing out that calis water problems don't actually make a difference here because of the relatively tiny amount nestle take. 
California water law is decades behind some states, so who knows what the situation is there.But every drop Nestle pumps in Florida is sanctioned by permits it usually had to do uber expensive science to justify. 
To be fair, Nestle has done some heinous shit so they deserve their hate.  We should still be skeptical of such stories tho because they have become such a good click-baity scape goat for certain communities(reddit).  
Lawns in general are a problem though. We waste huge amounts of land, fertilizer, water and labor.... For appearance. Grow something besides turf. Either grow drought tolerant or plant something edible. Or mow it with a goat so it at least produces food.
I grew up there, and I do miss the Santa Anas on an early Spring day, but that was mostly because it meant that the smog trapped in the Valley would clear out just enough to let you see the mountains around you.
Right?   This is one of those times where corporations need to be reminded that Governments have Guns.

Not that I'm advocating violence,  but you get an obstruction of justice charge on your record and it's a different story for these people. 
Are we still against civil asset forfeiture?
I certainly understand your intent and sentiment, but what you are suggesting is the implementation method of fascism defined.  
No knock raid please
So California is the GOP?
Hail Caesar
Stfourfes is a usually pretty decent, and I mostly recognize it for the "hamburger helper" type stuff.
Thanks for sharing this passage from 'Cadillac Desert' and the other information, including the details about threats to freshwater habitat and groundwater depletion. Lots of important points there about the enormous strains on water supplies.
Well not owning a cell phone is just silly at this point. I can't imagine why you wouldn't own a cell phone if you're not a luddite. 
Destory a childs chance at education and even if they escape slavery they are screwed for life. That seems especially vile over and above the vileness of slavery to me.

Its why children aren't permited to work in the 1st world even paid under most circumstances.

He said "Public Right" not "Human Rights", which is not necessarily the same thing. And then you ignore the part where he says "and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water."

You pay $70/month for clean potable water. Presumably if you had a permit and a well, you woudn't have to pay anywhere close to that for water that hasn't been purified.

They should be liable for fire damage where their pumping has increase fire hazards. I doubt that will happen, especially with the dismantlement of the EPA, but i wish it would.
It's almost as if the legislature here only listens to corporations, who would have thought that could happen after how well Gov Brown did with the gas leak in Porter Ranch?
[Inverted Totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism) is a good term. 
Unchecked corporate growth and control.  We left capitalism long ago, and now we have corporations running us.
Anyone who has looked at this knows it's not water bottlers that are the problem in California, it's agriculture. I remember when people complained about the Sacramento water bottling facility and how it was immoral to take that water during the drought. Problem was Nestle was taking .0002% of the state's water and was making it into clean drinking water. It takes far more water to make beer, but people don't associate things correctly so here we are. Water has passed soda as the #1 soft drink so clearly people aren't going to stop drinking bottled water. 
California does.  Actually a lot of the South West United States has a long term water problem.  They're basically trying to live in a desert.  Numbers are based on a year of much higher rain fall than normal, the underground water table continues to drop.  Basically they have to start doing something.
Go on then.
It's happened before. PipelineS have been dynamited in the middle of the night before.
Fuck Nestle
No fuck the crooked government officials that have allowed Nestl√© to do this.
Fuck Americans for letting this happen in their democratic country. 
Their contact expired in 1988, yet they continued uncontested until 2015, and will still be collecting water in 2018, 30 years after its expiration 
Sure, but that's why you water it efficiently; drip feed it, or do it at night.

I can't tell you how many times I've driven near fields while they're watering with a fuckton of sprinklers at 2pm.

That's a lot of lost water due to evaporation.
I smiled way too hard at this one. Now I'm sad. 
You're not too far off base...

> When floods and mudslides in 2003 destroyed portions of Nestl√©‚Äôs pipes, the Forest Service allowed the company to rebuild and didn‚Äôt require a new permit.

> Gene Zimmerman, the forest supervisor who was in charge at the time, retired in 2005 and has since done paid consulting work for Nestl√©.
Ok guys, plug that hole up.

What about these other holes?

We haven't been fined for those yet, keep em pumping.
California's State Water Resources Control Board has permitting authority over diversions of surface water. There are some complexities in this situation relating to groundwater, as explained in this part of the story:
>Vasquez said Nestl√© ‚Äúlikely has an appropriative groundwater claim to an unknown amount of developed percolating groundwater that would not have contributed to surface flow in a natural channel elsewhere in the watershed.‚Äù 
>He was referring to a distinction in state law between ‚Äúpercolating groundwater‚Äù ‚Äî or groundwater that is filtering down to an aquifer and is not subject to the water board‚Äôs legal authority ‚Äî and groundwater that is flowing ‚Äúin a known and definite channel‚Äù and does fall under the board‚Äôs authority. 
Other than having to explain what it can/could lead to, I don't know anyone who uses the Internet who is for against NN.
I mean I always thought it was a nice two story house and at least two (running) cars. 
Oh damn :/ when I can't even see irony maybe I should get to bed 
Upvote for Cadillac Desert! I read sections of it out loud on road trips as we pass the various dams and diversions of the state.
That's another oft overlooked issue as well; 36% of US grown corn is fed to livestock and another 40% used for biofuel.
edit: More current and comprehensive statistics updated for last november https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/background.aspx
There really isn't a better solution in this country though. For a lot of crops, if they weren't grown in CA, they wouldn't be grown much anywhere else in the country. It's not like you can move all the land somewhere else. How do you replicate the sun and almost clockwork-like growing seasons?
Then you will probably freak out to learn that Monsanto effectively controls %88 of all corn grown in the United States, and %90 of all Soy. 
Or you could just buy a chicken 
I live in a corn state. It's mostly animal food, and actually all the field and farms in my area are being developed. I hate it.
Yeah the water has actually already dried up.  Now Cali is unsustainably draining deep aquifers that are 100 feet below where they should be.  
Because other fields are incapable of producing other crops? Just look to Europe. 
The good news is, most of what California grows are "luxury" foodstuffs. I mean, if something happened and I wasn't ever able to eat an almond or pomegranate again, I'd be disappointed. But I'd live. 
Let's be serious though.... although I love everything on that list. It's not like I couldn't live without them. As long as we have the core, Apple, oranges, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumber then we'll survive. 
The central valley has an almost year round growing season and soil that gets fresh nutrients from underground aquifers flowing from the serrias. It's literally one of the best places to grow in the world and as more and more people move there the water tables get depleted faster and he ground can't hold as much water
the flooded fields are a thing that many people dont understand about this.

Its not cause the rice needs all that water, its because the rice is fine with growing in that environment and a flooded field means nearly no weeds between the plants.

It also means you dont need watering systems.
Cows piss it back and most of it is eventually returned.
Doesn't most of the water evaporate? California is hot and dry.
What are you doing in the bathroom?! I only have to shove 3 gallons of water (OJ if I'm feeling frisky) up my ass to get a bowel movement started. 
Here is a USGS link with further sources cited:

https://water.usgs.gov/edu/activity-watercontent.php

It's mostly about the water required for the feed we give chickens. Most animals aren't very efficient at turning food into edible protein because of lot of energy is lost to metabolic processes. If you were taught about the food chain when you were young, you might remember that only about 10% of energy is retained as you move up each step from primary producer, to herbivore, to carnivore, etc. The chickens aren't drinking 50 gallons of water in two days, it's the water that was indirectly used to grow feed for the animals that creates the bulk of it.
You're right, it's hard to compare them at different weights, so thank you for going through that math. I think you messed up somewhere in the calculation for almonds though. If an almond has .3 g of protein and it takes a little over a gallon to produce one, shouldn't it just be .3g/gallon? Still better than both eggs and beef but not by quite so much.
what would you guess your exact almond-to-orange ratio is? i like getting scientific like this.
But the almonds give you infinitely more protein than an orange.
I saw a documentary where he did that.

Since he said that, I think he's was diagnosed with some type of cancer or growth... I kind of feel bad, but I also kind of don't.
Oh I am not saying that natural burns are not necessary, but due to human interference the burns are much worse than they should be. I simply mean that if an area needs to be prevented from burning, this seems to be enough water to even have made a small lake.

Edit: to clarify, I meant to prevent the major, out of control burns that sweep across the dry state and burn entire forests and homes.
As someone else has stated as well, don't forget that many plants require natural burns to germinate. I don't mean to say that we should simply water the ground necessarily, I meant water areas suffering from drought as in use it in places crops are dying from lack of water. Also, you can't make a direct comparison to amount of land burned, as there would have been far less land burned if there had been preventative measures. But I do agree, the burns are far more widespread than a simple system would fix easily.
it's not just water waste...if they actually do not have the rights then it is being stolen.
Yes but ecosystems do not work on a state level. It could be a tiny percentage of the state, but as I mentioned about the stream, it makes a massive impact locally. If I were to say something taxed only .05% of state citizens total income, the statistic looks different if it turns out that it comes from only a single town and makes a significant portion to those affected.
It's not bullshit. The individual doesn't save much, maybe a couple gallons a day by not watering their grass. However, once you multiply that by the thousands or millions of households in a city, you gets tens or thousands of gallons or more a day. 
Corporations are people, friend. Rich powerful people who don't obey laws or worry about police.
You seem to be forgetting that the reason they get away with things is that they own the government.
I think they need to be reminded that WE have guns.
If you got fuck you money, nobody got guns.
The problem is that the root of ALL negotiation power comes from violence and power; corps and many politicians have no fear of that any more, so they act with impunity.
Probably has something to do with the amount of abuse and exploitation that goes on in the factories that make the tech. You know, people working all day for pennies, child labor, that sort of thing. If I had to guess.
This isn't up to the EPA (although I'm sure a case can be  made). This is a state and perhaps a local water beef. I'm sure Nestl√© has bribed someone to allow their sweet deal to continue. The recent crackdown  is moving at a glacial pace to preserve the blatantly illegal status quo. If the state wanted to they would slap a cease and desist order on Nestl√© until the  matter is settled in court. 
All it takes is an angry former homeowner or two with an enthusiastic lawyer to try that lawsuit on for size.  

They don‚Äôt even have to win, if they can take up too much expensive lawyer time, the profit margin and headache factor could be enough to make them cut back.
Holy shit, that *is* a good term. I like that.
running the US*
This is capitalism.
Maybe you mean to say we left the idea of a free market long ago? 

Capitalism is inherently anti competitive, that is really the whole point.
This is exactly in line with capitalism...
I'm really sorry but that's just a giant failure of the government. They have every power to decide that issue.
Perrier's contract expired in 1988. I wonder what they showed Nestle that would make the company believe they had the water rights in the first place. According to the article, Nestle didn't come into the picture until they purchased Perrier in 1992.
We have a similar issue in Australia with government draught assistance. Farms that did nothing to protect themselves by moving towards water efficiency get a hand out to save their business in time of draught while those that do the right thing to reduce their water usage and protect their farm get nothing.
I've ran into quite a few on Reddit. Mostly in some gaming communities though (Which is kind of ironic)

I have to explain how stupid it is that they think it's a good thing that these ISPs, who screw you over and over again, lobby in states to remove the ability for local communities to start their own ISPs, run disinformation campaigns, and try to mandate who pays what... want NN gone.

Yea, they suddenly care about people? Haha, tough fucking luck. Of course they don't.
Americans sometimes argue as if ‚Äúthe American way‚Äù is the means towards the American dream. That corruption and big corporate is unamerican. I argue that it very much is the American way and that the American dream was never used as vision for the country.
The origination of "two cars" was created in error, when it was mistakenly purported to be campaign promise made by none other than Herbert Hoover. A campaign of one of Hoover's Democratic opposers purported errantly in 1932  that Herbert had campaigned in 1928 on a promise that his voters would get a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage.
 
> According to an article in the New York Times (10/30/32), Hoover did not make such a statement. The report was based on [this ad](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/187095) placed by a local committee -- which only mentions one car !

Poignantly, quoting some of Hoover's campaign promises from the ad reveals much irony considering the following Great Depression, for which he was largely blamed by the world, his nation and his people:

> Republican prosperity is written on *fuller* wage envelops [sic], written in factory chimney smoke, written on the walls of new construction, written in savings bank books, written in mercantile balances, and written in the peak value of stocks and bonds.

The "two cars" quote (which was actually only ever "one car"):

> Republican p r o s p e r i t y [kerning unchanged] has *reduced hours and *increased* earning capacity, silenced *discontent*, put the proverbial "chicken in every pot." And a car in every backyard, to boot.

Hey, I only promised one car, guys! Can we hush this whole depression scandal now? How 'bout [three eyes](https://youtu.be/4gHcUGpBllY?t=37) on every fish? I won't let you down this time!
Bottle some water, profit and disregard any irony. Sleep later.
We are a corn and sugar ridden country. I cant imagine what would happen if we had a drought that effected corn crops. 
The rest are in my cupboard. You ever notice you never seem to run out of canned corn?
Thank Republicans for that boondoggle. W Bush did thst.. Drove up the price of feed, beef, gas and lowered the taxes on all three 
I eat meat and I'm not trying to be moralizing, but damn, so many of our problems would be way easier to fix if we all went vegan.
Biofuel is good though, right?
> There really isn't a better solution in this country though.

Vertical farming and actual seasonal eating.... 
Certainly not in Omaha 
With these,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming/
Not to mention the cheap undocumented labor that they have
Vertical farming.
The only reason Monsanto dominates is because their seeds have the best margins due to yield and other factors. They don't dominate because they're the only game in town - if another company provided seeds with better yield for the growing conditions farmers would most certainly be using them instead. 
I'm more freaked out by your use of % before the number.
I don't like corn and I'm allergic to soy, so I'm good.

Take that, Monsanto!
That's a commonly circulated misleading stat that includes products with a Monsanto trait in it. Dupont has outsold Monsanto at times in Soy and corn, but Dupont licenses with Monsanto to put RR gene in their products. 

Most folks don't know GMO crop products are regularly bred products with the GMO portions backcrossed in. It's not one two or a few, it's hundreds of products. 

Monsanto pays other companies to put their products within Monsanto crop products, it works all ways. 

Your cell phone has tech within it that the manufacturer had to pay someone else for the right to place it in your device. Ford licenses with Toyota, Toyota licenses with Ford, and so on...
we need to make GMO almonds that can piss
Last I looked at it, the cow doesn't really consume all that much water, it's mostly to grow the feed. Alfalfa, corn, soybeans, and most grass takes a lot of water to grow, and cows eat a LOT of it and convert only 5-10% into human-usable calories.

Best just to cut the middleman (middlecow?) and eat the beans and grain yourself.
Essentially all water used in agriculture is eventually returned.  There's this thing called a water cycle.
Maybe he goes twice a day.
Mine is zero, personally. 
That's the thing, you keep saying irreverent the major burns. They're only major burns because y'all keep preventing the smaller ones. At this point, there's not really a good option. The woods are a fireplace, and the longer you're stopping burns, the higher you're piling up firewood inside of it. At this point, avoiding any burn is just making sure the next one reaches your roof.
 
Prescribed burns are the way to go, people. It's better for the land, better for the animals, better for the plants, and better for the people.
and if it is, then it will be dealt with.  I was responding to a more general comment re: drought & water use.
I doubt it even has a large effect normally, a decent sized farm will use more than nestle's california bottling operation.

People tried hating on them for bottling water in Canada but ignored the fact that the Fraser river in Canada discharges more water in a few seconds (IIRC) than nestle used to bottle water in a year. 
The water you use in your house has already been diverted and stored in a reservoir. More water evaporates from those reservoirs or transfer canals than will ever be saved from reduced domestic use. Definitely worth it to reduce use with lawns, landscaping, pools and ponds. Even then though, so much water is used for Ag that it' would be hard to make a dent. If there was a drop in usage in the cities, it would just go to more Ag anyways.... and that's the truth. 
If I blatantly defy a legal order, I get dudes with guns up in my business enforcing that order. I don't expect it to happen, but Nestle should experience the same. Like when Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to enforce his orders to desegregate schools because Little Rock tried to say "no." 
And tend to have more legal rights than actual people just because it's able to afford it.
Which California is doing it's best to rectify.
It's california, they have the neutered remains of guns.
I agree, friend. It's time to storm the Bastille.
Would you say it‚Äôs our responsibility to remind these corporations that they are outnumbered by potentially violent masses of Americans?
Not to mention the mines that supply rare metals used in the factories.
That is a good point and not something I had thought of at all. 
Yea, the EPA as it exists today? Fuck, they wouldn't do shit for this even if it was in their jurisdiction. 
I don‚Äôt think you understand how massive Nestle is.  Lawyer fees are nothing to them. 
It's a rehash of Marx. But it is a good  term.

>...the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.
Could be, but competition was also supposed to be a part of a capitalistic society.  It's what drives prices down, and is supposed to be a driving force of innovation.  We haven't had competition in over 30 years in the markets.  Everything is owned between like 20 corporations.
It's true. Us mountain folk are pretty pissed off at everyone and anyone that has failed to put a stop to this bullshit
I‚Äôve tried to talk to my congressmen, and got the same boilerplate letters, which is frustrating as hell. I know they don‚Äôt read any comments directly, but my thought process was that if Republicans/conservatives are worried about liberal media... why on earth would they give those same media entities the power to straight up censor them and ensure they never get re-elected? Apparently the short term payday is worth it to them
Well I think the American dream was the house and cars in the fifties and sixties and over the years it‚Äôs just becoming well meaningless. 
Nothing, they would just lower the ethanol mandate and everything would be fine. 

Ethanol shouldn't even exist.
Sugar dogs?
Corn can be grown in pretty sub-par conditions. Its only a little finicky at the start of its life. Milo will be planted once I becomes to dry or hot to host corn. It can be used like corn in almost all the same ways.
Corn yes, sugar no. The government limits the total amount of cane sugar we import as a handout to farmers who get simultaneously subsidized to grow corn. That‚Äôs why so many products have corn syrup instead of sugar. Sugar don‚Äôt grow well here, corn do. It‚Äôs funny you never hear the GOP talk about the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù with respect to farming subsidies but they‚Äôre happy to dump the estate tax "for small farmers" and destroy the healthcare system.  Small farmers went away in the 20s. Surprise! Republicanss never read "The Grapes of Wrath."

Because they don't fucking read books or learn from history.
Yeah if you never buy it, you can never run out of it. FTW
Corn was heavily subsidized long before Wanker Bush.
Currently, the price of corn and pork is pretty bad.
[Uh no.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3976383-obama-administration-calls-still-ethanol-enter-u-s-fuel-supply) 


Sugar based ethanol like the kind they use in Brazil is much more effective. Corn based is just another subsidy. 
Not really. It's bad for your engine as it's harder on the components and is not exactly healthy for the environment either but it's also not worse in itself. What makes it bad is that it requires more energy to use and wears out the components requiring faster replacements.
Biodiesel yes, Ethanol as gas additive is one of the fucking stupidest things we have done in terms of energy policy. 
Depends. E.g. if it's not based on waste products, how does it compare to growing forests on that land instead?
Some yes, ethanol is a waste if money because of how inefficient it is to make and use
Seriously. Seasonal eating would make a huge impact.

I grow most of my own veggies in the PNW. Yeah, I don't get to have avocado's. I don't have broccoli year round, I finally mastered stupid radishes, and if I fail then I have to go to the grocery store or rely on neighbors.

Why do we have to have everything available year round? We have nutters screaming about GMO food, but not the unnatural growing conditions and the environmental impact that shipping food all over the country from a single state can cause.

If a company comes out with seasonal produce and vertical farming, I'll support them in a heart beat. In the mean time, I grow my own produce and supplement from local farms. 
People have no idea how expensive ‚Äúvertical farming‚Äù is for things other than lettuce. I grow citrus trees by a type of hydroponic system of sorts. Want to know want my electric  and gas bill costs? $5000 a month. And that‚Äôs just for one house. I have 7. Vertical farming is not practical for orchard type crops. 

Seasonal eating would probably lead to nutritional deficiencies. And it wouldn‚Äôt even solve the problem you‚Äôre talking about. Want to know where the US gets their citrus in the summer? South Africa and Australia. How does eating seasonally solve the drought in California when you‚Äôre eating fruit from SA? It doesn‚Äôt. California would have to completely pull out of agriculture, and then there would be a global shortage of fresh produce. 
No, but drive an hour in any direction and it‚Äôs corn out to the horizon as far as you can see. Nebraska and Iowa grow lots of corn.
Not like its exclusive to farming or CA

Um that's found everywhere though
Wow it's like a market yields results that favor good products
It ain't just the invisible hand of the free market holding them up. It's predatory business practices.

>There‚Äôs also evidence that farmers lack access to lower-priced [non-GM] seeds. In 2010, University of Illinois researcher Michael Gray surveyed farmers in seven agriculture-intensive counties of Illinois. He asked them if they had access to high-quality corn seeds that weren‚Äôt genetically modified to contain Monsanto‚Äôs Bt insecticide trait. In all seven counties, at least 32 percent of farmers said ‚Äúno.‚Äù In one county, 46.6 percent of farmers reporting having no access to high-quality non-Bt seed. For them, apparently, they had little choice but to pay Monsanto‚Äôs high prices for Bt seeds, whether they needed them or not.

>Few firms have as methodically mastered the revolving door between Washington and industry as Monsanto ‚Äì whose former employees and lobbyists frequently enjoy top posts at agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and on legislative committees ‚Äì or groomed as deep ties with both Republican and Democrat administrations. The company spent close to $6 million on lobbying in 2012, more than any other agribusiness organization, and three times the sum dished out by the second-highest paying firm, Archer Daniels Midland.

>The public will suffer the costs of Monsanto‚Äôs capture of almost total control over much of the U.S. seed business. Since 2001 the company has more than doubled the price of soybean and corn seeds, whose crops are used in foods ranging from cereal and pizza to chocolate and soda. In 2008 Monsanto officials said farmers should expect seed prices to keep rising.

Yeah unfortunately Monsanto has shown their seed to cross germinate other producers seed and then forced them to destroy their seed thus eliminating competition.

Seems more likely Monsanto would just buy that company. The industry continues to consolidate (with monsanto itself merging with Bayer)
But afaik those are grown for cattle

I never said anything about the people stopping minor burns. I agree, like I have already said, that burns are necessary. I am saying that major ones should be prevented. You are speaking of a separate topic, which is related and I do agree with you. But I am only currently speaking about the dangerous, spreading wildfires. Your suggestion is also another way to prevent them as well. 
The only reason I particularly dislike this, is the fact it all draws from a spot in the national park. The article states it has dropped a stream to barely a trickle, which will definitely affect that area. Many people are commenting that it is a small portion compared to the rest of the state, but the problem is that is is not drawn from the entire state, just from one specific area. I understand the point, but I also feel that it impacts the park far greater than the people trying to compare it to the overall state usage realize.
Worth noting that, in response to to the integration of Little Rock high schools, the superintendent closed all high schools for a year.  His plan, which he stated publicly, was to lease the school buildings to private schools in order to continue segregation.  The closing required a public referendum, which passed.

Ethanol is one of the replacements for lead in gasoline.

Yup, since the early 70s IIRC. 
But he's the one that expanded the subsidy with the ethanol fuel program. Which is a hilarious waste of money and even energy. It costs more energy to produce ethanol fuel from corn than it even contains, because of petroleum based fertilizers. It has a negative energy return on investment. 
[Farm subsidies](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/agriculture/subsidies) have been around forever. 

TL;DR: Farmers are on food stamps and get paid to not farm land because prices would get 'out of control' if they didn't get free money.
Don‚Äôt confuse facts with the Reddit company line
Massed produced pork tastes like shit too.  
I have a flex-fuel Fiat Strada and was told that the engine life when using ethanol was better than gas. So is that incorrect?!
I'm curious where you are that radishes are a problem. I plant radishes between my main crops b/c they grow so fast & easy.
You make it sound like there is nothing between orchards and lettuce. There are tons of annuals that produce vegetables and fruit that are not that costly. And solar power, and leds get more and more efficient and cheaper every year. 

> Seasonal eating would probably lead to nutritional deficiencies.

We have that now with our current corn based ag system. We some how pulled off the malnourished fat person. This is boring concern trolling bullshit. 
Assuming the market is open. Then it becomes a good argument for capitalism. On the other hand we have shit like internet service providers. 
[Actually] (https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted)
Uh no.  They pay for the destroyed crop as well as the cost of destroying it.  If your field is let's say 75% gmo then it didn't happen by cross pollination ( especially because almost no-one grows their own seed crops, they've bought seeds every year for the last hundred years) but by intentional selection and cultivation.  Percy whatever the fuck his name is literally blasted his whole field with roundup to find resistant growths and used those as seed crops the following year.  He went out of his way to get them.
This is just what rich corporations do. It‚Äôs a flaw with capitalism.
Right, beans are better well done!
Many of those lands used to grow roughages and commodity feed grains are also well-suited for human-edible crops, and the switching costs are minimal.  

Speaking from my experience in Ohio, all of the clover and alfalfa fields on my family's farm once grew row crops (corn, soy, oats, and SRW wheat), and all it takes is a couple of tillage passes or chemical applications to convert them back, as is done regularly to maintain their yield.

We even contracted our soybeans out to a processor for soymilk and tofu one year, so it's not impossible to feed people directly, and we only had around a 25-30% yield drag compared to the feed varieties, (and part of that was due to our negligent chemical applicator) which was made up for by the customer's premium.

Most of the problem is in finding a customer to take edible crops, since all of the mills around us only handle feed grains. (And *that* is because there's no end market, since consumers by and large eat animal foods instead.)

If there's lands that can *only* support hay and grazing, we should put them in conservation programs and let them revert back to their native forest or grassland cover for wildlife habitat, soil rehab, and carbon sequestration. We'd have plenty of land left over once we're not burning away 90% of our calories to convert them into hamburger and chicken nuggets.




And then it evaporates in the sun, and is returned to land in the form of rain, and then it all starts over again.  That's why its called a cycle.
I got you. 
 
I think another idea would be harvesting the biomass to burn for energy.
Possibly, but in the unlikely event that someone actually deploys the military or National Guard to enforce compliance it seems likely that whoever makes that call is beyond done with Nestle's bullshit. You can try and play legal games, but once someone introduces actual soldiers into the mix you have to consider that they can and quite possibly *will* just flip the board on you. 

I mean, Alabama desegregated. They did so kicking and screaming, but they did desegregate. But I can't see Trump siding *against* the large corporation, and it seems likely that the California government is either unable or unwilling to really do something that would stop Nestle cold.

Wasnt it related to Cuban sugar and the embargo?
If the source of the energy being used to make it were renewable, that wouldn't be a problem, since the utility of fuel is storage, portability, and network independance would outweigh the straight inefficiency.
To be fair the government has fucked up the Ag market so badly that farming isn't possible without massive subsides. The farmers, large and small, have to $upport the pols who have a boot on their throats to do business.
I somewhat disagree. I can get pigs on occasion that have broken a leg or whatever, take them to a butcher, and they taste fine. I know that individually grown hogs taste better, but not everyone can afford them. I do think that mass butchered pork tastes like shit.


Alternatively to the other comment (and I have no idea, just a guess), the engine is designed to take ethanol, rather than gas. You can use both, but ethanol is better. Much like for a regular engine, it can take both, but gas is better.
It made you buy the car didn't it? If you have small engines (lawn mowers, weed eaters, edgers, etc.) then you have probably noticed how they seem to either run like shit after a year or so, or just stop working all together. This is due to the ethanol in the gas. 

Car engines are being designed better to run on ethanol, but it will eventually do the same thing to the fuel lines in your car. I think it gums up the fuel system, but I could be wrong on that. A mechanic would be a better source of info right now for this.
I was a complete idiot and packed the dirt too tight once, then again I let them grow too long and get too spicy.

Now I have an aquaponics system for playing with and just line my main crops with radishes. 
You‚Äôre right. There are tons of things between orchards and lettuce. I would love to see more Ag come back to the states so we know it‚Äôs grown more sustainably. 

But the biggest water users are orchard crops and vertical farming isn‚Äôt going to solve that, unless people want to pay $20 for an orange. Vertical farming will never replace orchard crops. The square footage needed is far too great. Also, in my experience in citrus, LEDs don‚Äôt yield a significant increase in growth and yield compared to the cost. They work great for some crops, but not all. 

And no. Not trolling. Just because I‚Äôm not fitting your narrative that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm trolling. 
If I was able to choose from five different providers I‚Äôd be all for an open market.  I‚Äôd likely get a better product for a better price. 

But I get to choose between Comcast and AT&T, and they don‚Äôt differ much. Hell, they might be the same soon. 
That's pretty interesting. Not sure what can be believed anymore. 
And we've inserted ourselves into that cycle in a manner that depletes fresh water sources far, far faster than they are replenished by the water cycle.
Octane is the fuels anti-knocking capability. A higher octane is less likely to auto-ignite, so an engine can use compression ratios and valve timings that are more efficient and produce more power. Most modern ECUs will automatically adjust timings (within a range) to suit the octane of fuel in use.

It has little to do with the actual energy density of the fuel and little to do with ethanol.
Except octane has nothing to do with the energy available in fuel in combustion.
Ethanol still has less energy per unit of volume than gasoline.

Edit: energy*
e15 melts all the rubber in my boat!


yay for having to drive 30 miles out of my way to find ethanol free gas...
No it was related to uprising starting because of food prices rising so Nixon worked to hold on to that little level of insurance against uprisings by keeping food prices artificially low at all times.


Although it was sold as a jump start to the economy as people than spend less on food and more on what ever else. 
Efficiency is still a concern with renewables. Which is why electric transportation fueled by solar and wind is more viable than subsidized corn fuel that requires more energy to produce than is generated.

Not to mention that at some point, any fuel should break even on the cost to generate it or you're not actually producing energy.
Perhaps... but iirc most of our nitrogen based fertilizer is imported from Saudi Arabia. They have plenty of energy, at least for now... but one way to think about it is our corn comes from Saudi Arabia. 
Brazil is suppose to be successful at doing it that way. They burn the leftovers from ethanol production to produce energy to process it.

It seems like every smithfield pork product I get tastes just off. Maybe it has to do with it having a certain % of water added to it, I don't know.  It just doesn't taste right.  Now go to a local meat market and the pork tastes more normal.  I do agree that the butchering process probably adds to it, and probably how the pigs are put down.   
I've never had a radish before, they taste spicy?

That's because infrastructure is usually a type of good called a natural monopoly and in those cases the invisible hand (government) is supposed to alter natural prices to include externalities.

I knew this wasnt gonna go off so smoothly. 
Judge should tell him, "You must supply water until the problem with the existing water supply is solved."
At this point why hasn‚Äôt the US government stepped in and thrown money and resources at this until it‚Äôs fixed? We can bail out corporations but not an entire town of people?
The biggest problem and this is one of many reasons why houses in cities all over the US are getting condemned. Remodeling and maintenance has not been done to these houses in decades. A lot of these people are poor or have shit land lords. The pipes in the houses also need replaced and that's not the governments job. The being said these people needs help and we need to find a way to help. 
"The complaint says Bryant's home was tested for lead during the most recent sampling for lead and copper -- from Jan. 1 until April 6 -- and registered 1330 parts per billion of lead in one test."

That's sky high.  And it makes me think its either an issue with his house, or the test was performed improperly.  Did they test the other houses on his street?  Is he on a dead end street that needs to be flushed?
Can someone explain this to me, I thought flint was fixed
I'm no expert but is the water like toxic waste?  Is it unfilterable?  Seems more efficient to supply filtered water to residents in 5 gallon jugs Rather than millions of plastic bottles.  
When will the international community put a stop to this? Surely, they can't just stand idly by when the US regime has clearly crossed a red line, poisoning their own people with deadly chemicals. /s

Edit: in all seriousness, this and Puerto Rico should be taken up by the ICC or the UN general assembly and economic sanctions and/or criminal charges levied.
I'm not sure about Michigan, but in my state, the water pipes are maintained by the city.

Why are they asking the judge to order the governor (state level) to provide water?  It seems like the judge would need to order the mayor of Flint to provide water (or clean pipes) to the people of his/her city.

Is it different there? 
Think of how much plastic is going into the landfill form all those bottles :(

They should get nestle to supply it for free considering the amount of free water they pump from the state to bottle and sell...
I don't understand Michigan's water right laws.  Can someone explain why the state is required to provide a city water?
So while people struggle for clean water, Nestle is bottling it from other sources in Michigan. Maybe Nestle should donate a bunch of water since they are fucking siphoning it out of Michigan to bottle anyway! Hell, let‚Äôs make Nestle pay for the entire water infrastructure to be fixed, they can afford it but their CEO is one of the biggest piles of shit on the planet. This guy would literally prefer to keep cities without water so they have to buy Nestle bottled water.
Why are people still living in Flint? It‚Äôs years later and they‚Äôre not going to fix the problem for another 3 at least. Get those people out.

Why don't they install whole home water filters? Its probably cheaper
This thread is going to turn into a shit show. Flint is so controversial that this will inevitably devolve into "There are hundreds, if not thousands of towns all across America with worse water quality than Flint! Fuck those people!!!1"
Why don't they skip a payment or two to the fucking war machine and fix the damn pipes so they can have clean water?
Good thing Syria is not bombing us for poisoning our own people and them taxing for it

why not filters?

At this point wouldn't it be cheaper to list the town as a quarantine zone and help people to relocate?

Can they please just buy charcoal filters instead?  
they're gonna spend all the pipe fixin' money on bottled water and not have any left for the pipe.
The fact that we live in the wealthiest country in the world and we can't just get rid done is insane. We were quick to cut checks to the banks though. 
Snyder is speaking at my graduation in two weeks. God I can't wait to see the shit storm erupt.
Get your shit together America.  Jesus Christ.
Why can't they replace Flint's government with competant people and replace their pipes with new ones? 
Why isn't a class action lawsuit by the People of Flint (tm) done?
Didn't they just give Nestle the rights to a well for bottled water? I don't see this going well.
Pretty good synopsis.  Edit for clarification:

Flint/state decided to build a pipeline in order to save money on water because flint was getting gouged by Detroit water, paying way more than Phoenix Arizona for water.  

When Detroit water (DWSD, now GLWA) realized their monopoly on water was about to be challenged by the new pipeline, they raised the prices so high that they essentially cancelled flints water contract, 2 years before the pipeline was completed, forcing the city to use the flint river.   

DWSD does not get enough credit for the flint water crisis, in my opinion.   Detroit water is so expensive because of the $7 Billion in debt they acquired through decades of incredible mismanagement.  

It costs essentially nothing to deliver clean drinking water in Michigan, what we pay for is servicing the debt.   (It costs money to build infrastructure that provides clean water to millions of residents, but the cost is pennies compared to what we are forced to pay)
Force Nestle to do it.
I honestly don't know why the people of Flint haven't rioted yet. Drinking water is the most basic of our needs.
Can someone please tell me when our next election is and who is running against him? I need to know who to send some campaign support money to.

**Edit**: I did not realize Snyder was at his term limit. Thank christ, it's felt like forever.
JUST FIX THE FUCKING PROBLEM.  Funny how the result is that the government has to buy more environmental killing bottled water. 
Yo how is this a first world country?
Why dont they just pour all the bottled water in a big water tank and then all the houses can be connected to that, then everyone gets fresh bottled water on tap

How bout arrest every person who let this happen instead of blaming no one. starting with the major who didn't feel he needed to test his cities water. i'm sure he will flip on everyone who made money off this. 
Maybe they can add surcharges for those who would like to opt-in to clean water.  This is the new republican way of fucking up infrastructure so someone else can make a profit off it.  Problem is, this is literally all of our taxes paying to build infrastructure that we are handing over to a private entity .  How fucking retarded have we become as Americans?
[removed]
Yeah, and it really shouldn't. Especially after giving that deal to Nestle and then immediately yanking Flint's water distribution. 
Disagree. The judge should say "You must supply clean water to the people of Flint untill the collapse of the United States of America  because that is the way a government works. These people pay taxes, and you handle infrastructure that supplies them with basic human needs. Get your shit together and stop being assholes to the poor"
That's basically what happened. Testing shows that the water is fine in 90%+ of homes. That's why the bottled water distribution was ended. The pipes are still being replaced and the process should be complete in another two years. 
Per the report it sounds like they're below the threshold of ppm.  It's muddy as far as any exact numbers in the article, but 90% of homes have <4ppm, and the threshold is 15ppm.  
According to the article, the problem with the existing water supply is solved.

"The state's decision on bottled water came after testing under the Lead and Copper Rule showed Flint's 90th percentile lead levels were 4 ppb of lead in sampling this year."
[deleted]
It is solved and done.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/flint-water-crisis-lead-levels-marc-edwards

From September of 2017

>‚ÄúToday, we have equally definitive data showing that the levels of these parameters currently in Flint water are now back to normal levels for a city with old lead pipes,‚Äù Edwards said.

>‚ÄúObviously, there is still a crisis of confidence among Flint residents that‚Äôs not going to be restored anytime soon. It‚Äôs beyond the reach of science to solve ‚Äì it can only be addressed by years of trustworthy behavior by government agencies, who unfortunately lost that trust, deservedly, in the first place.‚Äù


So the issue isn't the quality of the water it's that the residents don't trust the government.  Just because you don't trust the government doesn't mean there is an actual issue.  

Also the city is giving out free water filters even though they aren't necessary.  There is no reason to continue bringing in bottled water.

That's a good question. It's almost as if the average politician doesn't care...
They did, and wrongly so. This is not the job of the federal government by definition. Further, Michigan[ has a budget surplus](http://wbckfm.com/michigan-ends-fiscal-year-with-surplus/)  *and* [has a rainy day fund](http://www.michigan.gov/budget/0,4538,7-157-40794-139072--F,00.html).  
There is absolutely no reason for the federal government to fund this. 
>We can bail out corporations but not an entire town of people?

I find that funny, and sad. Flint has had water problems for nearly half a decade, and every effort is being made to avoid actually fixing the problem.
Because "money and resources" don't magically make replacing pipes go any faster.  Work still takes time.
> At this point why hasn‚Äôt the US government stepped in and thrown money and resources at this until it‚Äôs fixed? 

At this point, why not do a quick google search before commenting? [The US government did step in](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-awards-100-million-michigan-flint-water-infrastructure-upgrades) (as did their state), and [the issue *is* supposedly fixed](http://www.michigan.gov/flintwater). I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there still could be issues in some homes though. 
http://www.michigan.gov/flintwater

The state says that lead levels are fine.  What is the issue?

I don't think they are lying.  Anyone can test their water, and I assume some people have, and we'd hear about it if the state of Michigan is just lying.  

Edit:  downvote actual data?  
I thought they had?  

There was just a reddit post that talked about all the money that has already been thrown at the problem.  
The government has thrown money at the problem. The fact is though, it's a problem that takes time to fix. They have to dig up and change pretty much all the piping. That's not an easy or fast task. 
If I recall correctly we did give them money back in 2016
Flint should be getting all their pipes replaced by 2019 according to the mayor.
It is a sad state for sure.  But a small town of people suffering does not have the same power as a corporation using a fat stack of cash to lobby for bailouts in Washington.  

This isn't an issue that is unique to this current group of Representatives.  It's been a problem for a very long time.
Flint switched back to Detroit Water service in 2015. The water has tested below federal standards since 2016. 
Corporations pay the government if they want to. The people have to pay regardless.
The EPA approved like a 100 million last may, idk what's happened since then
Corporations donate to political parties, and they have really generous lobbyists. The people ... meh ...
Because lead limits in Flint have reached acceptable levels under U.S. law, however many residents are understandably still skeptical of the water citing discoloration.  Regardless it‚Äôs meeting federal safety requirements so Uncle Sam don‚Äôt give a fuck.
Because it's a state issue, not a federal one. The problem has been solved, the toxicity levels are way below the line. I can understand why people wouldn't trust it but who's going to keep paying for their water? They're only draining their own tax dollars.
Gotta build bombs. 
You know why.
Because its an urban town filled with black people.  Do the math.
For what we spent bombing Syria last week we could have fixed the pipes in Flint 4 times
same reason puerto rico is still a disaster. the city of flint is mostly minorities. 
[deleted]
> The pipes in the houses also need replaced and that's not the governments job

Shouldn't they be on the hook since part of the reason those pipes are all now fucked up is because they're the ones that switched to this new water source that destroyed everything?
> or have shit land lords.

this is the biggest one.
Yup. There's a lot of homes that have problems downstream of the public water system. The government is not going to come in and rip all the lead pipes out of your house and yard. 
I‚Äôm wondering who did the testing. 
Water testing stations are located at the water treatment plant and at certain locations around the city.  If the main lines from the treatment plant to these testing locations have been changed, they will show up clean no matter who is sampling them.  It is the final mile from the main trunk connecting to peoples houses that is the problem.  That is exactly why at home testing is important.

What I am taking from this debate is that even if water at point X is testing clean by ABC Agency, water at point Y can still be contaminated because of what happened to the pipes between X and Y when the water source was switched.

A brief rundown of what happened:

1) Flint gets new water distributer and begins pumping that crisp cheaper water.

2) This new water stripes away (scales) the mineral layer that was built up in the lead pipes essentially protecting the end user from lead.

3) Once mineral layer is stripped away, new water source begins dissolving lead from the piping into the home.

4) People realize this and rightfully flip their shit.

5) Flint stops new water source that caused all the damage and went back to old water source.

6) Need to wait a few years until that mineral layer can be built up again to protect the piping.


The main pipes are probably pretty low lead at this point, since rheoretically likely what was first replaced.  Real problem is that the last bit of piping is gonna be fucked up, and it's not going to be easy for them to be repaired.  For a lot of these houses the property value is such that it might make sense just to tear down and rebuild.  I imagine a lot of these houses have all sorts of code violations.
It's not. Many of the pipes still need replacing and some houses and neighborhoods still test very high for lead. 
The water is not toxic. Since 2016, water tested no longer exceeds federal standards.

Filters are supplied along with the bottled water. I do not know if the water was supplied in the typical 20oz bottles or larger jugs. 
According to the state, the water has been safe to drink for more than 2 years.  

Plus they give free filters to every house in flint, and are continuing to give free replacement cartridges.  

I still wouldn‚Äôt drink the water.   
You are correct, however since the city government was financially in shambles the state government took over some control to attempt to fix the city's many issues. One of these things was the city water, which was purchased and piped in from the Detroit water system. They determined they could save money by providing their own, and until that infrastructure was ready they temporarily switched to drawing water from the flint river, which caused the lead problem since they didn't add enough anti-corrosive materials to the river water. So yes the city is responsible for the water, but the state was in control of the city when the switch was made that caused the issue.
Or think of all the lead families will be digesting ... 
I know, right? Bottled water is the worst, most wasteful thing they could possibly do.
I see you saying this multiple times throughout this thread, can you source your claim that they are pouring tons of chemicals into the water to get it to test ok? Extracting lead from water does not requires tons of chemicals to do so

EDIT: Nor does preventing leaching from pipes. And since he deleted his comment, I think I can consider it case closed that he was talking out his ass. Now why there are people coming to this thread to do so, is an interesting question of it's own
They do not dump chemical into the water to test it. They take a sample of tap water and send it off for analysis. 

Lead poisoning does not cause open sores. 

It sounds like you have some serious medical issues and should see a doctor. I hope you are able to do that soon. 
they arent

but the city went broke, the state helped

they went full bankrupt, the state helped

they started taking emergency loans and the state said "balance your budget or we'll do it for you"

shocking twist:  they didn't balance the budget

so Michigan installed an emergency city manager who slashed and burned the budget until they could afford to pay for future services

i say future because they abandoned decades worth of debt to people who did work for them and are now shit out of luck

one of the ways they slashed the budget was to find a new water source, which turned out to have a composition that exposed damage to the ancient water infrastructure in the city

this released lead into public potable water... and they cant afford an alternative AND cant afford to fix it

so despite years and years of the rest of the state using tax money to help them get water, and almost a decade of donations and charity to help, they still dont have enough money to get a long term solution

what they really need is citizens with jobs and companies to move into flint to supply jobs... but since its a lousy shithole with the unpleasant citizen remains of what was a city, thats not likely

so yeah its probably gonna take a bailout to fix the water infrastructure, which they cant afford to purchase OR maintain, so after its all fixed and good, they will still need

spoiler alert

more money
They were providing bottled water because testing showed that the levels of lead in the water exceeded federal standards. 

Since 2016, the levels have tested below those standards. 
The surveys they got from people in Michigan said that none of them wanted nestle to get increased bottling per minute. It was around 80,000 (8,000?) against and 73 for it. Why are they allowed to do it if the people say they don't want them to do that for very really and genuine concerns?

Um.. so from what I understand, the opinions were like "things for survival shouldn't be used for profit" and environmental reasons. Not just "nestle sucks".

I hate Nestle as much as the next girl, but they have been a major contributor since the start. 

EDIT: Since we are on the subject though, I would like to briefly don my tin foil hat and point out that Dennis Muchmore, Gov. Snyder's right hand man and top aide is the husband of Deb Muchmore, top spokesperson for Ice Mountain (the water arm of Nestle.) Tin foil hat off. 
Lol.  Force Snyder to re supply everyone with bottled water.  Next issue to discuss is to stop nestle from making bottled water.
My guess would be money. You can't give those properties away, let alone sell them
Help one of the over 3,000 other communities that have *worse* water quality than Flint.
Sponsor a family. Literally the only way you can guarantee you're making a difference and I have no idea how to facilitate that.


Anything you send here will be picked over by the people with means before dribbling down down down to the masses. 
Get everyone from Flint a ticket the hell out of there. The city has been a disaster area since the 80's.
Provide as in pay for or make certain it is accessible? 
As far as I am aware, no.  There are plenty of people that have to dig their own well and treat their own water.
It doesn't always work out because they have to be replaced so often due to the toxicity of the water. 
Effective home lead removal for a place like that would require big countertop multistage filters, which means each household requiring expensive replacement filters regularly.

For the same price you can provide water bottles which are guaranteed free of lead.
Because a lot of the lead contamination is coming from pipes inside of the homes. 
Whole home water filters only work to a certain extent in this case. 
Work with Flint people. Most houses have filters now as the DEQ's CORE program installs them for free, and will continue this. Problem is 90% of the people don't even trust the filtered water. You have to keep in mind the average citizen of Flint barely made it out of high school, so if you go from poisoning their water to saying some magic piece of plastic will help, they will have a hard time understanding. 
I don't think anyone said "F those people". The bottled water was discontinued because since 2016, the testing has shown the water no longer exceeded the federal standard. 
The city won't let them. If they shut their water off due to nonpayment the city will take their children because of bad living conditions. 
"That's communism" 

- Republicans, probably 
In this instance a state responsibility. The State took over the decision making for this.
Don't remove lead effectively and run out quickly because of the amount in the water. 
That depends on the amount of lead in it to start with. Household tap filters can only handle a certain amount of lead in the water, so once it's over their threshold, the tap filters (which are still being provided) do little to no good. 
And for the Pentagon.
They're too exhausted by all of this. They are downtrodden in every sense. 
Michigan has term limits, Snyder is not eligible for re-election. 

The election is Nov 6.  
> Can someone please tell me when our next election is and who is running against him?

Nobody is running against him, since he's term limited out.
Why don't you just do the research yourself? I did a 10 second Google search and there is a entire [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_gubernatorial_election,_2018) about it.
I like Shri. 
It's not
Because the problem isn‚Äôt the water it‚Äôs the pipes. They are ill-made and leaking poison into the water, if they had clean pipes running to everyone‚Äôs house they could have fixed this years ago.
The problem now isn't the water, it's the pipes
Hahaha. Because that would be basically rebuilding the entire city's water supply system, which is what they already have to do...? 
the problem is not the water, the problem is the lead service lines. though the water is safe people do not trust the state, nor do they trust the existing service lines 
AG Schuette has filed criminal charges against several people. 
> How bout arrest every person who let this happen instead of blaming no one.

thats like 25 years worth of local flint democrats

i dont think thats really what you meant
The decision to change water services was made by the Flint mayor and city council. The plan had been in place for 20+ years. In fact, the mayor was the board of the new water system they created. 


The decisions were made by Flint‚Äôs mayor and city council. 
over 3,000 other communities across the country have worse water than Flint.  Unless you're going to posit that all of those are also majority black you don't really have a leg to stand on.
The city water meets the requirements, and the nestle thing is completely unrelated to Flint.  
We've got enough money to bomb 8 different countries over multiple decades and cut taxes for the richest among us, but if you want clean water in your town you can fuck right off.
It's not only flints problem, it's a big issue in wider america
Wait you get free water with your taxes? 
Kajit has water if you have court ordered papers and coin. 
Even if accurate, 10% of Flint is a lot of households. 
[deleted]
Dude I'm in flint typing this as week speak no the fuck it has not been solved I don't care what media propaganda u post , nothing personal but it hits close to home LITERALLY 
Except my entire apartment complex doesn't have access to potable water unless we can afford to buy it at a store. Most of us are disabled or working poor, very few have a total household income above $1000  a month. My carer and I live entirely off my $750 SSI. All of our food budget for one week is less than the cost of enough bottled water for one week. 

There is no word on when or even if they're going to repair the pipes to our complex.  I don't call that "fixed" I call it doing just enough to quiet public outcry until public attention starts to drift, then leaving the most vulnerable fucked.
it is "solved" because they changed the requirement for the water. 
Enough of your facts! They don't even care about my feelings!
I do understand your point, but I can say with complete certainty that most people complaining aren't just "eyeballing" it. They've got test kits provided to them and they are testing outrageously high still. It's one thing to read an article from a UK based media outlet. It's another thing to live and work here. The problem isn't solved my dude. They have said that 50% of the residents water was tested. That doesn't mean shit. The city of Flint has quite a gap in standards of living over certain areas. Even just crossing an intersection you have housing prices that jump by $50,000 for the same sized house. Those are the kinds of neighborhoods that are likely being tested. I work with about a dozen guys that are still testing high on a monthly basis. They depend on bottled water to make formula for their babies, cooking, etc.
You realize they've lied and said it was fine SEVERAL TIMES, right? "They" being Michigan state government. 
Did you read the article that we're commenting on?  Residents claim that tests have shown dangerous levels of lead in their water.  The case isn't closed until we find out who is wrong.
It's not acceptable until there are no more old lead pipes.
Yes but not all of the pipes are replaced. The article says there are still around 4% of homes that tested way above the limit.
Uh, it's not me saying my water is not potable, it's my apartment complex and their 3rd party testers. 

The filters they're giving require a phone and the ability to receive deliveries. I can't get a phone because they won't ship government phones to po boxes, can barely manage to use one, and can not sit outside all day waiting to let them in the building (no buzzers or way of letting a particular apartment know you're there). They last maybe 3 days of light use before the indicator turns red in our water. 

The price of safe water for a week is higher than my weekly food budget. 

I'm definitely not the only one in this position, but I'd bet good money there are also others besides my neighbors in the same complex.


>it's that the residents don't trust the government

With good fucking reason! The issue isn't the SOURCE of the water, it's the DISTRIBUTION of it which is still the city's responsibility. What is wrong with you people. 
Does the average American care? Doesn't seem like it. Politicians take their cues from the people. If Americans were really up-in-arms and demanding action, I think this problem would probably have been fixed months ago.

Until the Supreme Court determines that people should be considered people under law, these problems are going to exist.
The residents of Flint don't care where the funding comes from. If Michigan won't fix it, then the federal government should step in. These are citizens of the U.S. that are being poisoned by their own government. 
> every effort is being made to avoid actually fixing the problem.

Except they *did* actually put money and a big effort into fixing the problem... This comment chain is a "no one cares and the government is corrupt" circle jerk, and while I'm usually all for that when it's valid, there's unfortunately zero caring about the current facts... 
Also, because there are other city's worse off than Flint, they just aren't in the news.  
Edit Sauce: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/
The lead blocking coating in home pipes is still stripped.  The local government won‚Äôt step in to replace the pipes they destroyed.
The issue is the improperly treated water completely destroyed the plumbing in every single lead piped house. The new clean water means fuck all when you're plumbing has been irreparably damaged. Saying the issue is over with because the water is clean is dismissing the fact that ALL these homes need completely new plumbing. 
> Edit: downvote actual data?

a LOT  of people are heavily invested in the "Flint Water Crisis" narrative.  You can't let things like "fact" get in the way of that.
We don't take kindly to you science types around these parts.
You aren't sighting relevant data. You are shifting the goalpost entirely and ignoring the reality of the situation. The PROBLEM is that the city, through negligence and corruption, had ruined the plumbing infrastructure of these houses, and they CONTINUE to leak lead (in spite of the fact that the main lines have been fixed) and make the water undrinkable due to the governments refusal to be accountable for the damages caused to these people's  property because of their crimes. This isn't some "narrative". 
Flint has a population of 100,000.. hardly a small town but your point still stands. 
Pruitt happened.
Even if the gov owned supply pipes have been fixed city wide, the same problem that damaged those pipes also damaged the private pipes going from that supply to peoples houses. 
>The problem has been solved, the toxicity levels are way below the line

Come drink some. Dare ya. 
I don't (I only know about the problem from Reddit, and am not in America), and would be interested in hearing why.

From the outside, it is absolutely unfathomable to me why this basic, clear and serious problem has been going so long.
100%agree , ofcourse with most of these problems the laws are never upgraded and don't require testing of the water  for metals.
I believe houses that are old enough get grandfathered when such laws are passed. Source: live in such a house. 
That is the basket of liability worms that was opened up.

In any other situation, the plumbing after the main tap and meter is the responsibility of the property owner.
The lead pipes were always a problem they just made it worse , the local government should  be on the hook for it just for being asshats the whole time. 
Yes, sadly and they just keep getting away with it.
I think whoever did just messed up the test.  The city tests it too, as does the state and the feds.
The law requires that samples be taken from residential taps. 
Sightly off, on your history of events. Flint choose to pull water from the Flint River instead of being charged at triple the average rate from Detroit. Their treatment plant and staff were not properly equipped or trained to take the river water. After numerous subject matter experts and regional water service providers who know what they are talking about warned them (audio and video transcripts of that City council meetings will substantiate this) not to do this, the mayor and City council made this decision, no one else.  After that pretty much spot on. It was the city's fault, if you want to pass blame, pass it to Detroit for gouging water rates and threatening to charge even more out of contract when Flint expressed interest in finding another more reasonably priced source.
It's more than a few years, but you also forgot "lead levels are now below federal action levels".  Meaning that lead being provided to the house isn't a problem.  Lead being received at the end user is, in some places.  That means the problem exists between the water supply stub at the street and the faucet that is giving them water.
Both. We got gallon jugs and 20 ounce bottles and all the sizes in between. Never larger than a gallon container at a time though. 
Or think of how many games will be adding a Battle Royal mode in the next year. 
> Extracting lead from water does not requires tons of chemicals to do so

The issue isn't extracting lead form the source, the source has never been contaminated.  The issue is preventing the water from leaching lead from the pipes on the way from the source to the consumer.
They do not dump chemicals into the drinking water to test it. They take samples from taps and send them for analysis. 
[deleted]
I understand that but my question is what is the states obligation to provide water to a city.   I grew up on well water, the state wasn't obligated to provide us with water.  Why is the State required to provide water when the City refused to hook up to a clean water supply due to cost?
> Since 2016, the levels have tested below those standards. 

As I understand it, the levels at the water plants are below lead levels. However, the testing at houses shows it still very much above the lead standard and this is because of the old lead pipes they switched too and would need to rebuild new ones. 

In short: Water-plant is now fine. Houses are not. 
[deleted]
What genuine concerns? If there's one thing we have a lot of in Michigan, it's water. Now, I agree that Nestle is a terrible company even by the standards of giant multinationals, but it's not as though their water pumping operations are the reason why Flint and numerous other towns in Michigan and across the US have contaminated water supplies.

Sam Kinnison, is that you?
[deleted]
Which the people of Flint would choose to do, cost allowing...if it weren't illegal. 

Not in the CITY. You can't drill a well in the city, can you?? Plus, who is paying for this? The people that choose to build wells in the US are usually building their own homes etc...
Don't forget Nestle being Nestle :)
Maybe you can answer this.  Are we sure there's even a problem?

http://www.michigan.gov/flintwater

The city and the state say the water is fine.  One homeowner tested high for lead.  How do we know its not a problem with his house?  How do we know the test wasn't just contaminated?

Someone from flint who is on reddit should test their own water.
interesting, i would have never thought that would be an issue
I think parent post if say to divert some money for all the military spending.
Neither Flint residents nor the state of Michigan make payments to the "fucking war machine". 
yes, but replacement filter cartridges get you more mileage than thousands of bottles of water. 
But which pipes?  Does the city still have lead water mains?  Is it one neighborhood with a lead water main?  

Its clearly not the whole city
I think you meant "what they are already trying to avoid"
I personally go with the Politifact version over your FoxNew account of the facts.

And the city's emergency manager, appointed by and reports to the governor. 
[removed]
I live in Flint.  The water isn't safe.
The water itself is likely safe now. The problem, iirc, is that it corroded a lot of old pipes that are now leeching lead, including the pipes leading into people‚Äôs houses. While yes, that is the owner‚Äôs responsibility even though the state damaged the pipes, a lot of people in Flint are dirt fucking poor, and their homes are worth less than nothing right now, so they can‚Äôt afford to fix those pipes on their own.

I‚Äôm sure a lot of the city pipes are also still damaged and leeching led.
Makes sense to me. Anything else would imply strangers caring about strangers for no reason. We've "lost" enough tax money since I've been alive to probably buy every American a decent house.
Cruise missiles quench my thirst for blood 
Well, it is the 'Merican way (TM)
No, you get clean pipes that funnel water with your taxes. That is the issue with Flint - the city's infrastructure is old and shitty. It needs to be replaced

I don't even want to get into how the people of Flint are still being forced to pay water bills for water they can't drink
You are legally allowed to go to any public park or municipality during their business hours and drink as much water as you want from any provided fountains :)
Agreed. Ideally, I'd like to see a scaled down version of bottled water distribution to the specific addresses that are still testing high. 
Look at who lives there. Do they have power? Will they all eventually leave?

Problem is solving itself. 

This is an assault on humans by its state government. With all of the wealth in our nation. We can't pay these people to leave or gut and rebuild their infrastructure? 

But we can bomb Syria in the hundreds of millions.
Lead levels are well below federal action levels and are continuing to drop.  For anyone who is still concerned about their water there are free filters available.  The problem is solved.
[deleted]
No they didn't. They're using the same ~~15ppm~~ 15ppb threshold which has been in place for decades. 

Edit: parts per billion, not million. Do you have a source for your claim that they changed the requirements?
Independent testing by the University of Virginia has confirmed the water meets federal guidelines.  The EPA has also affirmed the state testing.
You realize it's not just the local government testing it now right?
Residents claim with no support that their water is bad.  Experts actually measure the lead content and it's within acceptable levels ... I would trust the scientists over people eyeballing it.
If you live in a city your house most likely has lead pipes.
Why?  There are tons of lead pipes in the US and they are perfectly safe.
That's about 3000 people, btw.
Reddit isn‚Äôt the reflection of the population. So I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for saying this, but it‚Äôs the 100% truth;

Many, not all, michiganians have forgotten about it or just don‚Äôt care at this point. Living amongst them, it‚Äôs easy to tell. You‚Äôll still get loud pockets who care, but people from Detroit suburbs, west side of the state, or up north are simply not going to care.

The thought process is this ‚Äúwhy should I care when it‚Äôs not benefiting me? The state budget is shit, our roads are just rock piles, and our education funding is slashed and the quality is reflecting.‚Äù

Meanwhile we still pay out the ass for taxes, like income, sales, increased gas tax, plates, etc. where the fuck is that money even going?

Then you have laws like our insurance lows which lead us to be the most expensive in the nation.

The residents of MI are all getting fucked. So most probably don‚Äôt even think of flint. And when you mention flint it‚Äôs automatically thought of as a shit hole. That‚Äôs how the thought process here is. And before someone says ‚Äúthey should care for other humans‚Äù well, remember we live in shit times where there‚Äôs lack of empathy, lack of community, and where the attitude is to just get ahead for yourself.

Residents of MI aren‚Äôt going to care when there‚Äôs all sorts of shit going down and flint has an already established stigma to it. 

It‚Äôs sad but true. Everything here is a mess.
Politicians are SUPPOSE to take their cues from people. Money typically has the loudest voice though.
What the fuck can the average American actually do about it short of just talking about it and donating resources which pooled together cannot possibly come close to solving the problem?

Also, politicians take their cues from the people when it benefits them or they can easily get away with ignoring major issues. Guess what it is in this case. Both! Local politicians are in some way have financial and political gain from not doing anything about the problem. Who's paying them off? Nestle? Who stands better chances of getting re-elected by promising to do something about it when the next election cycle comes?
Same as why many don't care about Puerto Rico. They feel as though the gov't in those locations caused the problems on their own and should fix them on their own.
*take their cues from the rich people.
Politicians take their cues from lobbyists and campaign donations. 
The US police have gotten too good at stopping riots and American people too afraid of starting them. 
From the article - 

‚ÄúFlint's 90th percentile lead levels have been below the federal threshold of 15 ppb since the second half of 2016‚Äù.  
That would set a precedent that if you don't fund something the federal government will pick up the check.
> The residents of Flint don't care where the funding comes from.

Ok? But the rest of the tax payers do.  
  
>If Michigan won't fix it, then the federal government should step in.   
   
That is literally what the judicial branch is for..not the federal government to throw money at.
> The residents of Flint don't care where the funding comes from.

Actually they do.  They want it to come from anyone but them, because they can't afford it.

Not because the state or feds stole their money or water.  Because they mishandled funds and budgets for decades until their infrastructure collapsed.
But the issue isn't truly did you put an effort into fixing people's poisoned water?  It's, "did you fix the people's poisoned water?"

The issue is whether the water is potable or not, and it still isn't, regardless of if they tossed 20 bucks or 20 billion at it.
Ya, I absolutely believe that, and it's a really complicated issue. 
How did the coating end up there in the first place? Running water through it until a scale forms.
Who do you think should pay for the completely new plumbing?
Until such funding is in place to replace the plumbing, what should a reasonable person do when told that tests show the water is well within safe parameters, and that water filters are still being made available by the state of Michigan.

The plumbing should have been replaced thirty years ago with copper.  The solution is still to fix the pipes.

Denver does the same thing.  Denver water has like a half million customers.  5000 old ass houses have lead pipes.  So Denver water pumps assloads of orthophosphate in everyone‚Äôs water.  I don‚Äôt have any lead pipes, and yet I had to replace my water heater because it was half full of scale.  Literally, I had to saw it in half and shovel out 200 lbs of crap because it was way too heavy to carry.  I had to replace my kitchen faucet because the sprayer started dripping, because it‚Äôs clogged with scale.  A faucet should not be garbage in four years.

These people need to fix their shit, and then we need to stop adding garbage to the water.  Condemn the houses is the owner won‚Äôt fix it.  Don‚Äôt push the problem onto everyone else.
Ask my aunt who is now bald because of unknowingly bathing in toxic water for months if this is a fucking narrative. What you think is just drivel and politics is actually their reality. 
I know.  Personally I think this one guy in the story did a handyman plumbing fix at his house using lead fishing weights.  There‚Äôs utterly no evidence that the municipal water has any lead in it.
If their pipes are lead, they need to be replaced.  They needed to have been replaced in 1985.  That‚Äôs not the city‚Äôs responsibility.  That‚Äôs the homeowners responsibility.

The city chose to put orthophosphate in the water to prevent leaching.  The city shouldn‚Äôt have done that, they should have told the homeowners to fix their shit or they will condemn the houses.

I live in a city with orthophosphate in the water.  It‚Äôs a fucking nightmare to deal with.  I don‚Äôt have lead pipes, I don‚Äôt want that shit in my water and nobody else does either.  
How so?
If they state has tested the water and they say its fine, then you need to test your own water and have data to refute them.  Just saying it tastes bad doesn't mean its dangerous.

My grandparents lived on a farm with very iron/suflur water.  It gave me terrible issues till I got used to it.  But it wasn't dangerous, it was just smelly and made me poop my pants when i was like 7 years old.  
https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/07/us/flint-michigan-water-bottle-program-ends/index.html

> Testing has showed the levels of lead in the city's water are below the federal limit and the water's quality is "well within the standards,"


Doesn't change the fact that its a state issue, and not a federal one. 
What the guy above you is getting at is that Flint is populated mostly by black people who couldn't afford to leave when the local industries (car parts, mostly) collapsed. So, very poor, very black, not really a high priority for a certain kind of politician is what he's saying there.
> I only know about the problem from Reddit, and am not in America), and would be interested in hearing why.
> 
> From the outside, it is absolutely unfathomable to me why this basic, clear and serious problem has been going so long.

This is likely due to your source being reddit, where upvotes and downvotes determine what you see more than fact vs. nonfact.  The issue is not ongoing.  There are literally *thousands* of localities that have worse water quality than Flint, but the focus remains on Flint because it allows people to push the "racism" agenda.
Then make em rent controlled until theyre fixed. Having a landlord's rental income drop from $950/mo to $200/mo might incentivize him to fix his shit.  

If *he* wants to live in a house with undrinkable water, that's fine, he's free to do that. If he wants to have other people pay for staying under his roof, he needs to make it worth their dime, or make it so ungodly cheap that he can say "you get what you pay for"
That's sort of interesting though.  If upkeep of your end of the pipes is on the owner, and the new treatment would have otherwise been benign, who bears the responsibility?  I think in this case much more than just the residential ends were fucked up by the new treatment, so not exactly our current case, but interesting to consider.
It wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the article, so I‚Äôd guess they did it themselves. You can purchase water testing kits anywhere - I‚Äôd assume some are more reliable than others.  



Slightly off still. 

- The Emergency Manager was the only decision that mattered at the time of the switch. The Mayor and City Council couldn't change that even if they wanted.
- The City Treatment Staff were "trained" to operate the facility, and did regular start-ups and maintenance. But they had never run the plan for more than a few days, and only in preparation for emergency water supply (eg, in the event Detroit couldn't supply water for whatever reason).
- Partially because the city's staff hadn't run the plant before, they received instructions from the State on how to run it, and followed those instructions. The original proposal included a buffering compound that would have made the water safe for the scale. The final proposal did not include this (I don't know when or why it was removed).
- Yes there were some serious shenanigans with Detroit Water and the KWA Pipeline. Yes this was the impetus for the switch to the Flint River. ~~Flint is switching (or has) to the KWA.~~ Corrected: Flint approved a 30-year deal with the GLWA (formerly Detroit Water). 
- *The "real" problem* in this whole mess is when brown garbage-water started coming out of people's taps and nobody took that as a sign of serious problems. The water coming out of Flint's water facilities was clean, clear water. Everyone should have realized there was a serious problem when the formerly "clean" pipes were suddenly contaminating the water; even the GM plant stopped using city water because it was so contaminated.
Why was Detroit charging more tho? Can the Detroit supply keep up with flints demand? What is your basis for "average" rate? Local? State? National? 
Yes and the solution to shitty, old, lead cast, and outdated pipes is not to try and cover them back up to avoid replacing them. All of the homes built at the ends of those lines have been contaminated by their municipal water service's neglect of the failing infrastructure. The local government and water service have a duty to the taxpayers they have screwed over to replace the contaminated pipes.

Source: my plumber father saw this 20 mins ago and just finished a pretty heated rant to me.
Say it ain't so.
And again I repeat, can he source the claim that they are dumping "tons of chemicals" into the water? By the way, he deleted his comment, so my guess is he was bullshitting, like I assumed.
That‚Äôs not correct. 
The University of Virginia has been monitoring the water for years and have done comprehensive testing for a whole range of chemicals and bacteria and they said the water is safe.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/15/whos-blame-flint-water-crisis/
I apologize, I'm not certain of legal requirements (or if they even exist). 

The state was providing water because the Governor declared a state of emergency and said we're providing bottled water, filters, etc...for people in Flint. 
From what I have read, the testing is based on residential samples. 
Yep.

I heard it from a podcast so I'll try to track those sources down to be 100% sure what I'm saying is accurate but they were afraid of corporate greed in relation to items we need for survival, nestle is obviously a pretty devious company, and they were worried about the environmental impacts of the big increase of bottling per minute that nestle received. 
The state does not actually provide the water. Under the Safe Water Act, states are responsible for implementing the regulations to protect drinking water. 

I can‚Äôt speak for all states, but in MI there are different water authorities. Prior to this debacle, Flint got water from the Detroit Water & Sewer Dept (a good portion of SE MI uses DWSD). Flint decided that they wanted to create their authority (which they did), because they thought DWSD charged too much (which is what we all think).  

At any rate, their new water authority was not ready at the time that the contract with DWSD was up. Flint and DWSD got in a pissing match with ended with Flint saying ‚Äúfine, f-u, we‚Äôll use the Flint River as our main water source for the next year or so until our new authority is up and running‚Äù.  That‚Äôs when the trouble started...


Again, not illegal. 
You can dig a well in Flint. The application fee is $200. 
> You can't drill a well in the city.

According to [this](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/05/drill_baby_drill_flint_water_r.html) news article, [Flint] City ordinance only requires that a residential well be approved and inspected by the Genesee County Health Department.  People don't do this because drilling a well is insanely expensive ($3,000 - $50,000 depending upon how deep and complex the well system needs to be) and municipal water is much cheaper.

> Plus, who is paying for this?

In Flint?  Nobody, because no one is going to want to spend the money to drill a well in every house if they don't have to.  Outside of Flint?  Whomever has to pay for the plumbing, electrical and everything else inside of the house: i.e. the homeowner/landlord.

> The people that choose to build wells in the US are building their own homes etc...

Well, yeah.  As I said, municipal water is generally cheaper and better than well water.  Not very many people actually WANT well water.  Maybe a few crazies who want to go off grid or want to "stick it to the man".  But the vast majority of people who build wells do so because they have no other choice.  It's either well water, or NO water.  Which is my point: the state doesn't have an obligation to provide you with potable water.  Your municipality might, depending upon their charter.  But not the state.

Welcome to home ownership.
What does nestle have to do with it
Pit Brita or insert filter company here against them. I'll make the popcorn.
Have a plumber test it. 
>  Are we sure there's even a problem?

Do you seriously believe anything the city & state say about this matter? If they had been honest & upfront about the situation, people wouldn't be anywhere near as upset as they are now.
Per your "version" -

"it goes too far to suggest that Snyder had advance knowledge of the risks and acted anyway...It‚Äôs worth also noting that many of the officials with these agencies who made mistakes are civil servants rather than political appointees of Snyder".


I went with the city of Flint website. 
From your own link:     

"... one-sided accounts gloss over the responsibility borne by local Flint officials who supported the decision, by an EPA that failed to press harder for changes as the problem worsened, and by officials of both parties who contributed to the longstanding fiscal problems at both the state and city level."

FYI - DWSD wanted the state to force Flint to continue with DWSD, Flint objected and on March 25, 2013, the city council voted to break with DWSD (with the full support of the mayor). 


Is that, legal?
Didn't they make the rules stricter?  Edit: Testing shows the water quality is well below the *Federal* limits.  Unless you are arguing that the Federal limits were also changed in order to make Flint pass?
I'm not doubting you, but I am curious how you know that.  Is there something about it that proves to you that it isn't safe?
Diabolically well said.
And isn't that what's really important? /s
>the people of Flint are still being forced to pay water bills for water they can't drink

What the FUCK? I had no idea that this was the case. That's extraordinarily despicable.

>That is the issue with Flint - the city's infrastructure is old and shitty. It needs to be replaced

It's actually not the age of the entire system, it's that the contamination caused degradation of the distribution network and lead to seep into it. All the pipes leading to homes became permanently contaminated and only half have been replaced.

I'm not sure if they are waiting until the the entire system is retrofitted before decalring all areas safe but best case scenario, only certain areas don't depend on the city for bottled water.

What they did was stop distributing bottled water all together regardless of where people live and whether their water is clean or not.

It is definitive around half the population is still without safe water and now has to get their own bottled water, which is going to be in extremely high demand.
Well you aren‚Äôt paying for the water as much as you are funding the infrastructure. If you try and go total solar and unhook from the grid some municipalities will still send a bill for what your share would be. 
Iirc the cities infrastructure is fine and the problem is people's pipes still being fucked up.
SLPT: You can go to the courthouse and drink from the toilets as well.
Unfortunately the money we blew attacking Syria is chump change compared to the 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut the GOP gave the wealthy.  
Well yeah, how else are we going to sell all those weapons we make to foreign countries?

Trump cares more about making good weapon deals than protecting infrastructure and the health& well being of his citizens. And you can tell a lot about a country and its leadership just by looking at it's infrastructure.
Who goes to prison though for an act of greed-driven negligence that resulted in the poisoning of an entire city?
[deleted]
People in the article claim tests show dangerous levels of lead still so I'd say more tests are needed.
The professor who uncovered the entire thing has himself said the problem was resolved.

https://youtu.be/2qY1XtZhjcQ

Corrosion control has been restored, the pipes are no longer leaching lead into the water.
I'll believe it when Rick Snyder drinks a tall glass of Flint tap water.
From the article:

>The complaint says Bryant's home was tested for lead during the most recent sampling for lead and copper -- from Jan. 1 until April 6 -- and registered 1330 parts per billion of lead in one test.

>The federal action limit for lead is 15 ppb, and the lawsuit says Bryant's copper levels also tested high.
You realize they haven't tested the water coming out of the tap in every single home, right?

The issue is that some pipes - not all - leech lead and other crap into the water.  So some areas do have safe drinking water now,  but if I lived there I'd only trust tests done with water from my own home.
I guess you must know better than the tests they‚Äôre buying.
[removed]
Replace those too before they too become a problem. Infrastructure spending is done out of the public good, not because it is cheap and easy. Have governments do what they are supposed to and stop making excuses for why an acceptable amount of lead is even a thing that exists.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html

Because the Flint pipes were ruined due to poor water quality. They actually have to replace the pipes in every single damn building. 
Not as long as Republicans are willing to cut corners to save a buck and wind up poisoning an entire city.
Exactly. Flint is not an outlier. There is nothing special about Flint's water outside of the media at this point.
Tons of people care. Just none of the people that can actually make the decisions.
You are not wrong. 
I disagree. What news are people listening too? NPR/Michigan Radio has a mention regarding the trials or this issue (the water distribution) at least once a week on the Morning shows. It's on Mlive, its on the Freep. 
I'll post a MORE unpopular opinion I guess has an influence here.  THEY (Flinters) elected the assholes who let this happen.  Why should WE (Everone else) bail them out now?  Kind of like California running off businesses and taxing the shit out of everyone, then being surprised when they come up short, so the ask the Feds to bail them out.
This confuses me because people say the water still is not able to safely consumed yet the CDC states on their website that anything below 15ppb is safe
There's still lead in the water, but it's within the "legal limit" if that means anything. Doesn't make it better, but the govt thinks it's acceptable.
You sound like a type of douche that would let somebody die for a dollar
Less than 10% of homes in Flint don't have access, the other 90% have all been fixed and now now have safe water.
It's a problem that takes a lot of time to fix. You can't just write a big check and have it fixed overnight. They're still working on it, and probably will be for years. 
This is the circlejerk he's talking about.

Per the article 90% of Flint has water 3x below the unsafe limit.  No mention of the other 10%, but a quick google says it's all back to safe limits.  The expert who came to warn about the crisis himself has re-tested and deemed it safe to drink.

You're a perfect example of the circlejerking, rather than googling.
The poor treatment of the water supply damaged their property, so the state/city should technically be responsible for the repiping.

The water in the main distribution lines is fine, many of them were also updated in the past few decades.  The problem is mostly after the tap and meter where it goes to the owner's plumbing, which is not owned by the city.

In most any other situation, it is the homeowner's responsibility to maintain their plumbing.  In this case, the crappy water damaged their plumbing and that opened up a basket of liability worms.
Frankly, I don't care where the funding comes from, but what you can't do is tell these poor people who've had their $70,000 homes devalued to $5,000 to pay $10,000 to re-plumb their whole home because of government negligence. At minimum there has to be some sort of assistance or program put in place to subsidize home plumbing repairs.

A reasonable person should say "here's a cookie government, thanks for doing your job. Now how are you going to fix the problem you've created?". That's the next focus. The actually water is clean... now the core issue is fixing the private infrastructure you've irreparably fucked. 
This is a false statement. The water at the source is clean but the homes plumbing has thousands of dollars of repairs. The Pipes are still shit and it is the negligence of the government that has caused this. They need to be held accountable for their actions. 
I'm sorry to hear that.  But I think what u/OctoberEnd is saying that the water is currently measured to have levels well below the federal standard.  Not saying that data is bulletproof, but it is likely correct.  

This doesnt negate the core issue, lead alloy piping.  My guess is they adjusted the pH of the water to stop the leaching of lead from the piping infrastructure.  

Me personally, I'd never trust the water in Flint again and would be working to purify my own supply.  
It's not a narrative that it existed.  It *is* a narrative that it still exists and is an ongoing problem that isn't being addressed.
It is the cities lack of care for their water supply that made these pipes unsafe. That's not even up for debate. That is SPECIFICALLY what happened. The city is clearly liable here. Your personal dislike for one particular water additive aside, an extremely common one too that is also really common in natural water environments. (Which by the way is some pretty Doctor Strangelove level shit, does it make you impotent too? Lol. I assure you, orthophosphate isnt the cause of these ridiculous claims you are making. Seriously though, if that is happening it sounds like your water has some specific unique problems.) 
So local government can poison their own people in the U.S. and the federal government  shouldn't do anything about it, but if a foreign country poisons their own people we absolutely need to throw hundreds of millions of dollars at them to stop it?? Fuck off!
[deleted]
Gotcha, whenever I read timelines, and I google Flint, I see what appears to be a normal city, so I couldn't understand why it is so bloody hard to get water to it!
Please come here and just drive around and then tell me about how it's an agenda. You don't even have to get out of your car, I promise. It's that bad. 
The tests are all pretty reliable.  ITs a very easy test.

I'm thinking the guy was cleaning his gun, got lead dust on his hands, and then tested the water without washing his hands.  or his faucet is 100 years old and made of lead.
All true, except, Flint has decided to stay with GLWA, and not source water from KWA.
> Why was Detroit charging more tho?

Partially, Detroit was mad that most of Genesee county was building/switching to the KWA pipeline, meaning Detroit would have significantly more capacity than necessary. But also someone has to maintain the current Detroit system, the more people they spread that cost to, the less per person. With parts of Genesee county dropping off, there was uncertainty in the cost.

>Can the Detroit supply keep up with flints demand?

Easily. Detroit's water system can handle about double it's current demand. Flint's demand is rounding error compared to Detroit.

>What is your basis for "average" rate? Local? State? National?

Flint was paying per CCF, like your water bill. The rates that cities pay is typically publicly available. Flint was paying almost double, compared to the lowest rate a city on the Detroit system was paying, at the time of the switch. Detroit threatened to raise the rate to almost triple if Flint didn't sign a long-term contract (which would have prevented Flint from switching to the KWA anytime soon, possibly killing the project). 
Average municipal rates for bulk treated water in Michigan is about a third of what they were being charged. GLWA has not maintained the line between Flint and Detroit, however they can keep up with demand. There are numerous leaks along the way that Flint also had to pay for. 
Who's going to pay for it
[deleted]
Did you read that article?

"And as long ago as 2010, the EPA expressed concern that "dramatic budget cuts" at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality were having a "significant impact" on its water program. The governor at the time? **Democrat Jennifer Granholm".**
Let me help: The water coming from the plant was never contaminated with lead. It was very acidic, which meant that it stripped and damaged the pipes, both those inside homes and those that supplied the water on the city end. Those damaged pipes are still leaching lead into the water as it passes through them, and they will do so until they are replaced. The majority of damaged city pipes have been replaced, but there are still lots of homeowners that just can't afford it. Lots of houses are testing perfectly fine. Lots of houses are not. The concern for most people right now is not continuous exposure, but spikes of lead, as damaged parts of pipes come loose and release into the water. The water is being tested in individual homes and at the plant (the testing on the plant end is for chlorine and bacteria levels, as it is at every plant around the country.) 
[deleted]
[deleted]
But also, not easy to have done, as evidenced by the fact that it's only happening at a rate of about 2 a year. Probably because most people were told, like I was, that it was illegal. 
I would hope this lawyer had a plumber look at this man‚Äôs house before filing the lawsuit.  It‚Äôs easy to visually see if a house has lead pipes and it‚Äôs very easily fixed.
I don‚Äôt think they are lying.  It would be trivially easy to check by testing water from some houses.  If one house has high lead levels but his neighbor doesn‚Äôt, then that guy needs to fix his pipes because the water itself is fine.  This should be pretty easy to figure out.
[removed]
Ok? I never said they didn't. You can't just ignore the fact that there was an emergency manager in place that made improper/poor decisions
[removed]
[I will make it legal](https://youtu.be/8H1gx2-WK4s)
They pass out home test kits like they're candy out here.  Also, lots of friends and family get skin irritation when using city water. 
If you turn your water off, they‚Äôll take your kids because you aren‚Äôt taking care of them.  
I mean, you can still flush turds with it. You can still wash your clothes and shower. The majority of household water consumption does not happen from a tap to a glass.

I'm not saying it's *okay.* But still.
>Well you aren‚Äôt paying for the water as much as you are funding the infrastructure.

The infrastructure that is currently sending the people of Flint poisoned water. 
Not if you unhook. It's if you're in the grid but not using enough to pay for your share of upkeep.
Pipes are part of the infrastructure. 
toilets are just big fat water fountains tbh 
Plus the cost of the last seven wars we we're and are currently still in. We could have been a powerhouse. All of us.
Just want to chime in that the money allocated to military spending was decided on in advance for that purpose and once a budget is made, they can't just throw money that isn't there at a different sector. Also the tax cut to the wealthy was done to everyone, just it's more noticeable to them because they have a larger amount of money the percentage drop affects. Math, and all that jazz. We can't confirm that the tax money would've gone to Flint even without Trump's plan. 

Michigan, however, has the power to help Flint at the local level. Why this issue has lasted this long, I can't explain other than the fact that leaders just don't care. It's a harsh truth to swallow.
Unfortunately Trump doesn't have a monopoly on selling weapons. Look at Yemen. While we are spending millions to bomb fake chemical factories we are selling weapons to Saudi Arabia who are committing genocide upon the Yemen people. Obama also sold weapons to Saudi Arabia to bomb Yemen.
Maybe the city manager who made the decision to switch off the Detroit system to save menial amount of money, then refused to hop back into the system 
There are ongoing criminal trials for various individual who were involved.
[For starters these people](http://time.com/4607810/flint-water-crisis-criminal-charges-emergency-managers/) 


[Oh and these people are facing some serious charges](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/health/flint-water-crisis-legionnaires-manslaughter-charges/index.html)
I doubt they're fudging it.  Federal authorities test the water too.  And anyone can just test their water with a $20 kit.  It would be international news if someone found the state was lying about the water.

Its so easy to check that I really doubt they are lying.  

Edit:  downvotes?  This makes no sense.  He's basically alleging that there's a large conspiracy of state, local and federal officials to lie about water, and its pretty hard to lie when ten thousand people can check their own water.  Has no homeowner ever done a test?
Oh man. Too bad he won't even set foot within city limits. Haha
Pretty sure he did that awhile ago.
This is speculative.  

The water going into the house is tested to be good, coming out of the tap is tested to be bad.  According to other articles (linked below), many residents have never opened their taps since the issue was found.  This means old water is still sitting in their pipes so of course if they test it then it will test bad.  Without actual information on this specific case I find this to be the most likely conclusion given that the water going into the house is known to be good.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/07/us/flint-michigan-water-bottle-program-ends/index.html

>Like Hawk, many in Flint have not opened their taps for years. They brush their teeth and wash their faces only using bottled water.

This is a rational response ... But leaving taps closed will mean it will still have tainted water in the taps so when you test it will test bad.

>Testing has showed the levels of lead in the city's water are below the federal limit and the water's quality is "well within the standards," Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder announced Friday.
Isnt that a problem with private pipes?
Well the tests being run show lead levels below the limit.  So no I don't know better but you must think so.
No comrade ... I trust multiple agencies that have tested the water and said it's safe.  This is not mother Russia.
Over 10 million people in the US get water through lead pipes.  Giving them all bottled water until those pipes are replaced is not realistic.  Those pipes are also not an issue as long as proper care is taken.
Your article is out of date.   Current measurements are within spec. 
A city that has been (mis)managed primarily by Democrats for decades and suddenly this is a Republican issue?    I can't wait for the followup when you talk about how Republicans are responsible for the rising crime rates in San Francisco too.  
Not that this needs to become a Republicans vs Democrats issue but before you go assigning blame know that Flint is run by democrats. 
When a government destroys the residential pipe system of all of its residents, maybe the government should be held accountable to fix it.
Wasn‚Äôt it a state appointed emergency manager that made the switch? And I don‚Äôt think flint voted for the man who appointed him.

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but that‚Äôs what I understood happened 
That is correct, but it's hard to blame the people for being overly cautious. 
The people are wrong then
Because there are properties that haven't had the pipes repaired yet. My entire apartment complex, with 10+ people in my mostly empty building, and 36+ buildings (most not so empty as mine) isn't below the CDC's limit. That's a *lot* of very poor people who now have to pick what they aren't paying to get water. 

I'm reducing my meals from 2/day to 1/day to afford enough for four 16.9-oz bottles per day. That's not just for me, but for my entire household, one 16.9 oz bottle per living thing per day is the most we can afford, even eating once per day, and paying only rent, electric, and bus passes.


15 parts per billion, that's what ppb means. That means if you had one million kilograms of water there would be 15 grams of lead in it. 

The CDC has produced a study stating that amounts as small as 5 micrograms per deciliter can cause lower IQ scores and motor function issues. That means lead could be more than three times as high as 15ppb and still not lead to harm.

Am I saying that we should all be totally fine with consuming 15 ppb of lead in our water? No. What I'm saying is that 15 ppb of lead does not constitute a federal emergency.
The levels of lead in Flint are lower than that of most of the state. The problem was not the actual water, it was that it was not treated properly. 
Theres an amount of lead in almost all municipal water supplies.
So because I disagree with the federal government funding a cleanup that the state government *by all counts of the law* should be funding especially given that they clearly have the funds to do so, I sound like a douche that would let someone die for a dollar?    
  
What it sounds like to me is you don't really understand our system of government, and are hence speaking out of emotion. You may want to keep your emotions in check.
Of which he or she only contributed .0000001 cent to, but principles and slopes.
I'm not sure how to parse "I don't care where the funding comes from".
Money does not grow on trees. Do you think a tax increase on all Michiganders is fair, do you think the individuals in the houses should get compensation, how would such compensation be divided, who would qualify ? What standard of remedy should be used.


Exactly, the core issue has always been the pipes leeching lead and that is still happening. I don't care if they're running Kool Aid through the pipes. It's still going to be contaminated with lead and that's the issue that hasn't been addressed. 
The problem is the mistreated water leeched the lead from the pipes. That is still happening today and will continue to happen. Replacing service lines to homes does not fix the plumbing inside the house that is still leeching lead. 

That's the ongoing problem that still exists and isn't being addressed. 
Thats a nice strawman you have there but no. The local government can't "poison their own people." What they can do, is try and find a cheaper way to provide their people with water which is what they did. It ended up being a huge mess that they have to clean up. Like I said in another comment, the federal government has already aided them in the form of a grant of $100m from the EPA. Also, comparing a failed water program to chemical attacks on civilians is a gross false equivalency. 
I love the selective hate for the Federal Government when they don't help when they want it. Happens every time a Hurricane hits, "why didn't the Federal Government help sooner! This is BS they don't care about us!" Well a bunch of idiots made it a states right issue and the state has to ask for Government help, if you don't like that your state official isn't asking for Federal help then elect them out.
It was a pretty nice place a few decades ago, at least as far as grim industrial towns go, but going from 500k to 100k population in that time, no city can really survive their tax base drying up that quickly.
Do you have Netflix? Watch Flint Town.


I lived in a 'safe' neighborhood in Flint on an acre of land and our bedroom window was shot out with 15 large caliber slugs one night. Right above my head. Still an open case for felonious assault. We moved to the country the same day because we had inherited another home. We are DAMN lucky to have had the resources to do so.


Our landlord said... We orchestrated it to get out of the lease, because we left so fast. Even though there's an active investigation, there were witnesses and damage, an explosion claim on my renter's insurance, and I had glass cuts all over me. That was one of the more insane, absurd things I've had said to me in person. 


There's arson, shootings, constant violent crime and desperate poverty. Flint has it all! 
> The tests are all pretty reliable.

***IF*** you follow the directions. If you don't, it's pretty easy to get both high and low results, and there definitely aren't webpages/videos explaining how to rig the test to show high or low... \<\/s\>
But they still have to pay ~~tens of millions~~ $79 million for the Kwa even though they arent going to use it.  

This is criminal in my opinion.  

They should have switched to Kwa. 
Interesting, do you have sources on this? Not that I don't believe you, water is just my world so I would like to read anything on the subject if possible.

I am not shocked that detroits supply far outstrips its current demand. I can see DWSDs side of it though as they need to get the money from somewhere, and losing a large wholesale customer like that won't help.

All around a shitty situation.
This is a much better summary of what I was trying to get across, thank you. 
Interesting. I wonder how old the transmission line is, material, etc. At some point someone has to negotiate who pays for what.
>local government and water service

>taxpayers

There's two possibilities right there
I‚Äôm saying they do not test for lead by dumping chemicals in the water. 
Per the MDEQ ([1-12-18](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/01/newest_testing_shows_flints_le.html)) - 90% of water samples were at or below 7 ppb of lead.

I also came across this - A study published in The Journal of Pediatrics shows blood lead levels in Flint children ages 5 and younger hit an [all-time low in 2016](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/03/study_shows_blood_levels_in_fl.html)
Capitilism is literally a breeding ground for corruption; it's what capitalism is built on, the exploitation of others. Not that it can't happen in other economic/political systems but they aren't inherently revolving around exploitation. 

Also, you want to talk about class systems..? 
They did. In 2015. Water lead levels have been below the federal action level since 2nd half of 2016.
They did go back. The issue with the Flint River water wasn't the water itself, but the fact that it didn't contain the chemical components necessary to prevent erosion of the protective layer in the lead pipes. Once that layer in the pipes was gone, *any* water going through the pipes would have lead in it, regardless of the source. 

It was essentially an issue with the delivery system (pipes), not the water itself.
DWSD wanted them to sign a 30 yr contract (like every other city that uses DWSD does). Flint did not want to do that, they wanted to use DWSD for a year, maybe a year and a half, until the new water authority was up and running. The Flint River had always been a backup source, and Flint basically said "Screw you, we'll just use the Flint River as our primary water source on our own until the new system is ready". And just as an FYI - the problem was never the actual water from the Flint River. The problem was that they did not treat it properly. 

*They did go back to DWSD in 2015. 
Unfortunately when they switched back, the pipes continued to leach. 
Not really.  Most of the big lead pipes were used from the meter to the house, which would all be wayyy underground up there.  Inside houses, its almost always been either galvanized or copper, with lead solder prior to the 90s, or plastic pipes in the past few decades.  There might be a few scattered lead pipes in the supply system, but that would be really rare.

Definitely would need a licensed plumber to give it a look, and some real traceable sampling performed according to some standards.  And in the end, it could just boil down to an ancient brass faucet with a ton of lead in the brass leaching out.
"State treasury officials still must approve the city council's move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be approved".

The correct response is: "I will make it legal"
No water??? You monsters!!! Now you feed that lead and dirt to your child right now and make sure they soak in it too!! 

I should not ever need the /s
Bathing in lead water is definitely not even on the same planet as OK.  Remember that lead gasoline causes a sizeable decline in IQ, and that's just through minimal incidental contact as one would get filling up gas tanks infrequently.  Now imagine you are showering in leaded gasoline.  
"Hey, poison's more expensive than water. They should be thanking us!"
Absolutely. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm absolutely not saying the people should be charged. I‚Äôm saying that municipalities basically bill for utilities as a tax more so than a service or commodity used. It‚Äôs how you get bullshit circular reasoning like ‚Äúwe still have to bill them because we have to pay the infrastructure‚Äù. 
Yes but pipes in peoples homes aren't part of the city's infrastructure. If the city had an amazing power grid but Kevin's house has fucked up wiring you wouldn't call the city's electronic grid bad you'd say the city has a great grid but Kevin's house is fucked.
This made my heart ache.
We've been back on Detroit water since 2015.
Snyder should be up the creek with the rest of them. 
Do you think most people in metro Flint have $20 to spare? LOL. Fuck me. That's the funniest thing I've heard all day...


That said, there are still free testing kits available. 
He said he would do so last year for 30 days. There are articles saying he pledged to do so. There is no evidence that he actually did.
Wow.. I didn‚Äôt know a head could go that far *into* the sand...

It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt think to run the taps for a bit to get rid of the old water.. lmao
Reply to /u/Shogouki. 
I said fix the pipes. Even the Romans used lead pipes and they suffered from lead poisoning too, they just usually died from something else back then. How many more years until those 10 million people are consuming toxic levels of lead? Who knows. This is why we fix broken infrastructure.
That the water from Flint river corroded the pipes is not irrelevant if you consider that a) not all the pipes in all homes have been replaced and b) not all homes have had their water tested by all of the entities you‚Äôre referencing. Their local/state government should be replacing all those pipes because they are ultimately responsible for their corrosion and contamination of water. 
Nice try, the **Republican** governor appointed a **Republican** manager for the city and he is the one who switch the water supply and caused this crisis despite objection from the democratic government.
The state asked for a full report on all of Flint's pipes in the 90s...Flint never bothered to actually do it. 
> Wasn‚Äôt it a state appointed emergency manager that made the switch?

The Flint City Council also approved the switch. There's plenty of blame to go around.
The Emergency Manager that "made the switch" was only overseeing it. The City council (whom the citizens DID vote for) [voted 7-1 to switch.](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/21/snyders-top-aide-talked-flint-water-supply-alternatives/76037130/)

So the city decided to switch itself, not the governor or emergency manager. 
Especially when the government told them it was safe before, which obviously turned out not to be true. It's easy to see why they would be skeptical, but they also can't just ignore facts indefinitely.
In addition, the state government is still making available water filters to the citizens of Flint.
The water is safe to drink, but there are areas where the existence of Lead pipes should be a cause for concern. Filtering is the reasonable answer, not a never ending supply of bottled water.
TIL, thanks for the explanation. So to summarize, there's lead in the water but it's not "harmful". Definitely gives an understanding on why the issue has been deprioritized. 
they have a surplus and rainy day fund for michigan. theres more than enough especially if they manage to get a discounted contract. witha job that big the cost wouldn't come out to 10,000 per house. it would be lower. 

Beyond that how about suing the bastards that fucked up in the first place? 

"The Flint water crisis began in 2014 when the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed to the Flint River. Due to insufficient water treatment, over 100,000 residents were potentially exposed to high levels of lead in the drinking water. After a pair of scientific studies proved lead contamination was present in the water supply, a federal state of emergency was declared in January 2016 and Flint residents were instructed to use only bottled or filtered water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. As of early 2017, the water quality had returned to acceptable levels; however, residents were instructed to continue to use bottled or filtered water until all the lead pipes have been replaced, which is expected to be completed no sooner than 2020." - Wikipedia 

What until then?
Doesn't change the fact that U.S. citizens are being poisoned by government supplied water and it still hasn't been resolved
I passed through flint about ten years ago. Everyone I bumped into in Michigan, from Flint to Saginaw, simply asked "Why the fuck are you here?"

Never been to a place where that's the first response to being an outsider. People were super friendly, don't get me wrong, they just found it inexplicable why some random Canadian would be there. 
I literally just started downloading it, thanks, and congratulations on the move!
And that is the Flint City Council...
I don't have links to the individual sources, but everything I know comes from http://flintwaterstudy.org/

It's run by the Virginia Tech Research Team who helped initially expose the problem in 2016. They try to focus on well supported research and news, and avoid the sensational stories with opaque sources. That said, they're human, so take it all with a grain of salt.
All those options trickle back to the taxpayer though..
Well, of course numbers hit an all time low in 2016, no one was using municipal water, lol. And yes, per the MDEQ, the same agency that distorted test results to cover up the crisis in the first place...I'd like a third party independent test, myself. 
[deleted]
My occupancy certificate for my house was issued in 73.  It says what the lateral line is made of.  Mine is galvanized.  These homeowners should be able to figure out what it is without digging anything up.  Hell, most plumbers know the neighborhoods they work and have a pretty good idea.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. 
What are you talking about? Do you understand what happened in Flint?

This started in 2014 when the source of water  for Flint was changed from the treated¬†Detroit Water and Sewerage Department¬†water (sourced from¬†Lake Huron¬†and the¬†Detroit River) to the¬†Flint River to save money. When the change was made - a change that the people of Flint had no say in - the residents of the city were exposed to high levels of¬†lead¬†in the drinking water because the state government did not properly set up the new format to clean the water of particulates. The lack of proper water treatment, along with leading to serious health issues for the people of Flint - including the deaths of at least ten people - has lined the pipes that carry water through the city of Flint with lead, making it unsafe to drink the water.

This isn't poor pipes in a person's home, this is the state of Michigan being negligent. 
Well his testimony about when he knew about the outbreak of legionnaires desease could really be the beginning to his end.
I don't know.  But its not possible that **NOBODY** has tested their own water.  Don't you think maybe a TV reporter did?  It would be a pulitzer prize winning story if the city, the states and the feds were all lying about something that is so easy to test?

This is just not logical.  At least one homeowner has tested their water in the city in two years.  Have you tested yours?
There are pictures of him at a flint residents house drinking tap water. After that he filled some jugs and took them home. 
It's not head in the sand.  It's the logical conclusion.  If you are seeing good water go into the home and bad water coming out, where is your problem?
Just did. 
They *should* be replaced, but for now the solution is distributing a coating internally to make the pipes safer to use.
Just about all of these pipes are over 100 years old.  If they were such a danger you are reporting them to be, why doesn't the data show it?  

You want something that is completely unfeasible right now.  Bottled water to every person with lead pipes is rediculous and the basis for your arguement is not based in science but in fear.
Darnell Early, the EM for flint when all of this went down, is a Democrat from Muskegon Heights...
Right, but the mayor, Dayne Walling(dem), and the treasurer, Andy Dillion(dem), both endorsed and signed off on it. Theres also the fact that the state has been in an economic decline and the EPA warned the state that dramatic budget cuts to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality were affecting its water program. The mayor who signed off on those budget cuts was Jennifer Granholm(dem). 

[Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/15/whos-blame-flint-water-crisis/)

My point being, if you trace it back far enough you can put blame on both sides or we can just accept this for what it was: a broad failure of government on various levels. 
So do it now. Just because other people fucked up doesn't mean we can't fix things properly right now.
Ohp, see that‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt know

TIL
While the city council did indeed vote to switch, the emergency manager made the decision to switch earlier than what the city council had agreed to, before the city was prepared to treat the water properly.  
Precisely, the water supply itself has been stabilized and is no longer an immediate threat to health as it comes out of the city pipes. The primary issue right now is that many people's homes have lead alloy pipes in them and while the water *was* bad, it eroded a bit of the oxide coating, leading to high lead levels at the taps. The only real solution is to either replace all the plumbing in all affected homes (the safest), or to continue filtering water at the taps and running water through the pipes until the oxide coating forms again.

In reality, if people used water filters and the water supply stayed safe, then water at the taps would be back to pre-crisis lead levels within a year or two as the oxide coating forms again, but as long as people have any lead at all in their water they are going to want the city to take care of them.

I can't blame their sentiment and I would be pissed to, but in a lot of ways I do think it's not the responsibility of the taxpayers to bail out individuals who have homes with shitty old plumbing. If you live in a home with dangerous old wiring and a power surge causes your wiring to catch fire and burns your house down, is that the power company's fault? None of the people who have wiring that's up to code were affected, so who is to blame? It gets tricky quickly.

Of course if you present these points and argue that federal and state taxpayers should not have to pay for the mistakes of Flint city officials, you get accused of "systematic racism" or hating poor people. It is possible to to have compassion for those affected and also want fair treatment for taxpayers at the same time, despite what many people think.  
Respectfully- ‚Äúresidents were instructed to continue to use bottled or *filtered* water......‚Äù
The state is choosing to end free bottled water, but continues to offer filters. 

You're absolutely right, but if we're going to play the blame game we should do it accurately. Local government =/= federal government and all the downvotes in the world won't change that. 
State Government*
That sounds about right. About 10ish years ago seemingly everyone in the state was having a really hard time and no one was really in the position to have much state pride. 

But from my perspective as a Michigander, the general attitude has for sure gotten better in the last few years. 
Lol well the circumstances weren't the best and I have PTSD, but thank you! 
Got it, thanks!
Aren't situations like this what taxpayers should be paying for though?
Lead does not disappear over night. It stays in your body for years. 
It ok, I'm just spreading the good word of the Senate wherever I can.
Close but a bit different. Most pipes in the area have lead solder and the city switched its drinking water source to a different area. The area had a higher level of bacteria so they had to treat the water but the treatment was bad and the ph was off so it ate away the barrier that stops the lead from leaking into the water. The water solution has since been fixed and the city's pipes have been fixed but the problem is the pipes in people's homes are still bad because the protective layer is still gone. The water the city sends is clean, when it goes through the city's pipes its clean, if you have replaced your pipes since the whole incident the water is clean but if you still have shit pipes then by time the clean water gets through your pipes its no longer clean.
I really hope so. He's handled this horribly and even if it wasn't him directly (it was) shit still flows downhill. 
I don't live within Flint city limits since my bedroom window was shot out last year.


They've tested it. It says it right in the article that they've tested it! It was even tested to be too high a few months ago...



You're not being logical in your eagerness.



Source from the article:


>The complaint says Bryant's home was tested for lead during the most recent sampling for lead and copper -- from Jan. 1 until April 6 -- and registered 1330 parts per billion of lead in one test.

>The federal action limit for lead is 15 ppb, and the lawsuit says Bryant's copper levels also tested high.


And you think he took those home and drank them?
The pipes in the home. I read the last time this made the rounds that the lead water damaged pipes that home owners were expected to replace (which not everyone can afford). Don't know whether that's true or not, but if it was as simple as you're suggesting - that they need only flush the pipes - then a judge probably will side with the city.  
  
I live in Upstate New York where water mains freeze and burst, so I get needing to flush pipes of dirty water. But it seems like the sort of no-brainer thing they would have thought of pretty early on in the testing.
>If they were such a danger you are reporting them to be, why doesn't the data show it?

a lot of the symptoms can be misdiagnosed or even completely missed unless specifically tested for. there's also the fact that lead exposure is so incredibly widespread that it's tough to find population samples which haven't been affected as to judge test results against. most of the more insidious results of long term lead exposure manifest in behavioural problems (increased agitation and violent behaviour, high blood pressure, general mental deterioration) as well; which tends to lead to people getting thrown into either the legal or mental health system; neither of which are equipped to or interested in considering lead poisoning as a factor in one's behaviour.

the problem isn't being fixed not because it's somehow "too expensive" or for some logistical reason. it's ignored because it effects poor areas of the world the most. when you've got slow, untreated, multigenerational lead poisoning happening, you've got a practically unlimited pocket of potential criminals to fill prisons with. tons of people in those areas don't see a reason to get their blood tested unless it's demanded of them; not that many of them can allocate the money or time to do so in the first place. that leads to massive underreporting of an already semi-hard to identify problem. 
They are. This shit takes time....and a lot of money http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/why_flints_lead_pipe_replaceme.html
Yeah, it really is a common misconception. I live near Detroit so I have followed this from the start. I have found Snyder to be a decent governor who gets a lot of flak for things that aren't necessarily in his control. Not to say he is perfect, but he seems to do his best with the bad situation.
I'll say this: I really liked the people & the nature. It was a beautiful state with kind people that just had this suffocating blanket of sadness and despair over it. 

I'm glad to hear that's changing though. I've always felt for Michigan. 
I'm not arguing for or against taxpayers paying for this. I just don't think the taxpayers will want to pay for it since they view it as a govt fuck up
Yes, in the bones and brain, which is why Dr. Attisha is still collecting baby teeth. It leaves the blood relatively quickly, halving in 6 months. Considering that by late 2015, everyone with the means had stopped using the tap water for any purposes other than flushing toilets, that sounds about right. 
Spreading treason, then.
>They've tested it. It says it right in the article that they've tested it! It was even tested to be too high a few months 

Two years ago it was 20 ppb, which is too high.  SInce then it has been fine.  We all know it was higher years ago, that is not a reason to deliver bottled water in 2018.  

>Bryant's home was tested for lead during the most recent sampling for lead and copper -- from Jan. 1 until April 6 -- and registered 1330 parts per billion of lead in one test.

That's HIS HOUSE.  For all we know, the guy has a 100 year old lead faucet in his kitchen.  Or he did a crappy DIY fix on his sink, and he melted old fishing weights to fix his sink.

Its far more likely he has a problem in his house.  There is absolutely no evidence the muni water has actionable levels of lead in it.  
I don't know, but even if he didn't drink those he still drank Flint water on camera, so it doesn't matter. He drank the water, no reasonable person disputes that. 
The government has been telling residents to flush the water ... But ... At least according to interviews, many have never turned the water back on.  So the lead sediment is settling into their pipes causing more damage.  

The fact that the issues with having lead in water is still sporadic and rare in individual homes with no connection between them indicated this is the problem and not the water. 
The government is replacing lead service lines, but it will take several years to replace them all.  There are free filters available until that process is complete.
Ye, I‚Äôm from a suburb of Detroit but haven‚Äôt paid much attention since I‚Äôve been away at school
The nature is great!


The blanket that you so eloquently describe is not. 
Perhaps I am misunderstanding your point - do you not think it is good that levels are at an all time low?
Puertorican here, the whole Island is without light, save for backup generators in hospitals and some public places.

Damage and flooding is severe in the southern and western parts of the island.

The only medium of communication we've had the last few days were radio, to the point that government officials were driving to the radio stations to relay information. 

In terms of phone signals and calls:
Only clients of a specific phone company (Claro) had signal, until today, when the company decided to cater to everyone who connects, for the sake of communication.
Medical Aid worker here. The main problem is simply getting folks there. Flights are spotty. We have an advanced team leaving via helicopter from Port Au Prince today. Were diverting teams from Houston(me) and Florida to head out. Were getting shuttled via cruise ship with a large amount of aid workers and supplies.

We should arrive on Wednesday.

 
I had a trip already booked for November to stay at my family home in Ponce. It's now gone for a relaxation mission to a build whatever you can mission. ¬°Ponce es Ponce!
Just wanted to say... My husband's company has clients in Puerto Rico who were finally able to make contact, and it's bad. The company is sending a requested list of items to Puerto Rico ASAP, mostly generators. We're here and thinking of you.

My friend and his dad are well known electricians in my town. His dad ran our electric dept for 25yrs. They just got asked to go down TO PR and help re-wire the entire island! I can't even imagine the work that is going to be waiting for those crews that go down there.

Edit: apparently my proof reading skills are lacking. 
Jesus I hope the international community is responding to this and everywhere in the Caribbean. 

I also hope America pushes hard to help Puerto Rico.  Up to 6 months no electricity? That absolutely would destroy any hope for economic rebound for years. It is so messed up especially with their debt and now destroyed infrastructure. How many millions in lost tourism? No capability to borrow or receive funds to rebuild. 

If Trump wants to show he is a world leader, then fix Puerto Rico first before you go play with North Korea. If you don't tackle those issues and help your fellow man, then something is truly wrong with America
i wonder how the Arecibo observatory is doing
My uncle just left on a C-130 with a bunch of other people for Puerto Rico to help get the Telephone and Internet back up. He mentioned a bunch of the other people were there with other specialties to help get Puerto Rico on the path of recovery. 
Haven't been able to reach my folks in the towns of Manati and Arecibo since Monday night. It sucks but I am almost sure they are safe.

Island treees and vegetation was devastated at about 80%. The before and after pictures are just heartbreaking.

It will take our country a long long time to get better but the US is helping. In some ways this could help kickstart some of the stuff that was in a bad spot before.

The electric infrastructure was basically dead before it hit si maybe this will get a big change to start.
There‚Äôs something I need to say and is that as bad as things are right now in Puerto Rico, it will be fixed and it will  get better.  The fact that the local government is broke is an issue, but is not an impediment.

Puerto Rico is entitled to receive a huge amount of federal funding for rebuilding; those bridges and roads that were washed out will be rebuilt.  Private homes and businesses that were insured will rebuild.  The electric grid was in really bad shape due to the fiscal crisis and lack of maintenance;  but a lot of that will have to be replaced anyway as it is gone.

I lived 22 years in Puerto Rico and I saw the rebuilding booms after hurricanes Hugo and George.  Puerto Ricans are not wallflowers, they are tough and resilient.  I have managed to get in touch with my friends over there and nobody is complaining.  They‚Äôre too busy rebuilding and getting on with their lives.
It's weird that my countries news platforms don't even seem to report what's going on over there. When Irma was going all over Florida, we got news non-stop. Now it's just silence..
Is there any way I actually can help? I'm dirt poor, but I'm able-bodied and young. Is there any service that will fly you out there to work search and rescue and that sort of thing? All I have is strength and endurance and a rudimentary knowledge of basic medicine.
What a mess of a thread. The US is, at this very moment, sending aid to Puerto Rico and yet some of the highest posts are complaining about Trump not sending aid.
If I'm an experienced bulldozer/excavator operator, could I volunteer my services? How would I go about doing that?
anti-Trump Democrats coming out of the woodwork to show how completely fucking clueless they are, despite all of them having months of sitting around circle-jerking in /r/politics, the place they claim to be the most intelligent on Reddit. 

Honestly, I'm loving this. Watching people literally show their own ignorance so blatantly is giving me such a confirmation bias boner.

The US has people on the ground assisting/doing what they can. Yes there is devastation , but people have not forgotten. They are also still dealing with recovery efforts in FLA/Texas as well. 
Ok ok I hate Trump as much as the next guy but he both commented and a lot of help has been coming in so the shit needs to stop.

Months of reconstruction is necessary, and if the climate keeps going the way it is, storms like this are going to be more and more common in hurricane season. I have a bad feeling that the Caribbean is going to become largely uninhabitable over the next decade, as it will just continue getting bombarded every hurricane season. 
What can be done to help?
People are dying and pleading for help but the Washington Post really needs that extra $1 to share that information, paywalls should not be used in this situation!
Does anyone know of any actual way to travel to PR to volunteer to help? 
If people will donate [$40,000](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ylinedesign/the-butter-boss-by-goose/description) toward a fucking Butter tool, there should be no question Pr could get the resources they need to rebuild. 
I'm sending my thoughts & prayers
Washington Post retracted their paywall for Irma coverage. The fact that the story is sort of about Puerto Rico going unheard I find it suspicious that they didnt extent the favor in this case as well.

A little hypocritical, no? I have friends who are still desperately trying to get in touch with their families. This news is pretty important for them.

edit: /u/washingtonpost
Canada here. Why is there no coverage from mainstream media about Puerto Rico?? Nothing on the news channels, Fox, CNN. You have a entire country without power. Wtf news reporters? 
This is 2017, how have we not helped them yet?
I have liked so many posts about this.  Has it not helped???
Orange Fuck face might want to help these Americans instead tweeting about football, fucking piece of shit Trump. 
My husband is a physician with a week off in October. We would love to come help. Does anywhere know who he can get in contact with to do this?
Hey Washington post. I actually felt like helping if I could but am not from the states and your shit subscription banner pops up over the top of your article so,,whatever. 
There's something I'm confused about, and maybe there's a U.S. separation of military and civilians that I'm unfamiliar with. 

Where is the US Navy Atlantic fleet in a time like this? We deploy Nimitz-class aircraft carriers to assist in humanitarian crises around the world. We have quoted to foreign powers that the usefulness of an aircraft carrier off the coast of a devastated nation cannot be overstated as it can provide food, medical aid, power, and a staging platform for those affected.

Yet I haven't seen a strong response. If the issue we're having for assistance is getting flights into the area, then get the Air Force to deploy it's in-country logistics wings and the Navy's Seahawks to assist. We have hundreds of available aircraft and significant manpower available in country to work with this, but efforts seem non-existent.
I recall that the more impoverished areas of the Earth are most likely to bear the grunt of global climate change.

The real sad thing is that Puerto Rico is bankrupt and can't help themselves. This is the REAL reason you don't run up deficits. The rainy day has come and there is nothing in the bank.
Where are you getting internet access? Is it rare? Some people inn this thread are desperately trying to get a hold of family members.

Do you know where people can get food and water?
Good luck brother
So how can I help? Are there reliable supply donation groups?
Well on the bright side the stars must look amazing 
Thanks for your hard work. 
Thanks for your help. I have family friends in dire need of it now. I appreciate you.
Thank you. 
I wonder why the military hasn't set up a huge logistics support chain for puerto rico...

Edit: likely i haven't heard about it, but part of me is wondering if Trump finds a tweet fight with the NFL more important than helping brown citizens in Puerto Rico. 
who is we ?
How can an everyday average dude volunteer to come out there and help out?
My girlfriend's siblings live in Ponce. I can't find much information on how bad they were hit, would you happen to have any sources? She's been freaking out, rightfully so.
Have you heard from anyone?? We have had no luck. Relatives live in el tuque and jardines de ponce. Between the flooding and hearing of landslides, we're going crazy.

And more importantly, they're people!
I had a friend argue this point with me, citing that, because they cannot vote, Puerto Ricans are not citizens.  This was when the media was telling the story of how Sonia Sotomayor's family "emigrated" from Puerto Rico. The goddamn media.

I wasn't working that shift but if I was I would of punched her nose. They Yelped about how embarrassed they were getting tossed out but mostly how embarrassed they were for the moron who didn't realize they were US citizens. 
I'm also gonna bet a good number of people think it's part of Mexico
They also have their own olympic team that competes against the US.  Puerto Ricans have their own sort of identity distinct from simply being American.  There's nuance to this that makes it less surprising.

Living in central Florida, I wish they realized that too.
Is that the only reason people should care?
So tired of hearing this stupid comment. Just about everyone in the US knows Puerto Rico is a territory. The problem is the territories being so incredibly disconnected from the country, (not implying this is their fault) not some some big show of international stupidity.
I wonder if more people would have realized that if Peurto Rico would have voted to become the 51st state in one of the past couple of elections where the offer was extended their way?

*edit* before anyone responds about what happened this June: that's coming **after** the island went $70 billion in debt with a 45% poverty rate, woefully under-performing schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems, having filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in US history. **NOW** they want to be a state. And by "they" I mean the half million that bothered to vote (of the 3.5M on the island).

Not saying we shouldn't help Puerto Rico. They ARE a US territory. But the balking about American's not realizing they are US citizens and all this demanding, entitlement narrative is pushing it.
I‚Äôm surprised how many Puerto Ricans continue to put up with us taxing them despite their lack of any representation in our federal government.
Overheard a guy at a restaurant say "maybe disasters like this wouldn't happen if they quit sending all these illegals over, God must really hate them lolololol".

Never felt more embarrassed to be from Texas, I wanted to just get up and scream at the guy that Puerto Rico is a US territory, he's talking about *fellow Americans*!...oh wait he would only care if they were white.
To be fair, the issue is muddled. For one, they can't vote. And how can US citizens be citizens without voting? Well, the issue lies with the fact they're an unincorporated territory. But why? And so the issue keeps going further down the rabbit hole. 
You don't even need a passport to go there, am I right? 

It sucks that I have Puerto Rico relatives and im not sure if im right.
... where is the national guard in this? Shouldn't we have relief deployed?
They aren‚Äôt white American citizens, so Trump is ignoring them. 
That's going to be a ton of work.  But I bet they make a huge amount of bank off overtime.

Look man, i fucking hate trump, but there are already tons of national guard units already there/on the way. I know because most of the NG and ANG from florida where already there BEFORE irma showed up. They were storing their equipment inside stadiums and should be already helping out.
Just out of curiosity, why can‚Äôt they receive funds?  
I know someone who had their wedding planned there next month...all those businesses just devastated 
Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. They were $70 billion in the hole before the storm even hit. Congress refused to bail them out, instead imposing an "oversight board" to dictate which creditors get paid an how Puerto Rico gets to spend their money. 

There will be no storm bailout to rebuild the government. Get ready for the rollout of the private sector shock doctrine. Anything in Puerto Rico that can be turned into a corporate profit center, will be turned into a corporate profit center. Just like the schools after Katrina. Puerto Rico is about to become an experiment in corporate rule.

They just plain hate Trump and are looking for any reason to criticize.

Anything shy of having Puerto Rico fixed within 30 seconds of the hurricane being over isn't good enough for them.

This isn't a political thing and we are working on fixing Puerto Rico.  The island basically got leveled, so there are the logistics of getting things to an island and rebuilding the whole damn thing.
I want to know this too. My husband is a physician and we want to come help.

Also people need to understand that PR is non-continental. Alaska has the benefit most being accessible through Canada, but it this were to happen to Hawaii things wouldn't be any easier.
He's currently trying to take down the NFL and campaigning for Luther Strange, so it would be nice if he upped his Puerto Rico tweets by like 5%.
Hawaii is a state. Puerto Rico is a territory that doesn't get to vote for president. They are us citizens though.

In the past, PR has been somewhat interested in statehood, but only somewhat - and adding them would benefit one party over the other and upset the balance of power. 
For the majority of their time as a territory they have not wanted statehood or at least not cared for it, and it has only now in the last couple of years become a topic brought up in referendums. I believe the last referendum for statehood, which was earlier this year, had something like 97% voter support in favor of it, but it's also important to note that that referendum had historically low voter turnout with only about 20% of registered voters voting, so it may still not be representative of the majority opinion in Puerto Rico.
was just about to make a similar comment... unreal how that's the top news story when 3.5 million US citizens are living in a post apocalyptic warzone right now
I came back to Southern Florida after Irma, and that first night I couldn‚Äôt believe how many mosquitos were out. I had to do some work outside and must have been bitten 30 times. It‚Äôs no joke how the standing water after a hurricane creates a mosquito invasion.
First, there a banal method around their paywall. Second, they are a business. Real journalism is expensive.
Please do not fly in. At least not yet.

Where are you staying? Transportation? Gas? Food? Water?

You might just be more of a burden than help.

There us no magic wand that will solve the issue in a day or a week or a month. [Help has started but will take time](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/09/23/fema-teams-try-get-arms-around-maria-disaster-puerto-rico/697164001/). 
I believe we're sending the Guard their way if we haven't already. Puerto Rico *is* a US Territory so we have to. 
I may hate Trump, but he has been good and we are getting help. Peoplr werr still here from Irma and the National Guard and Army came to help. I think the navy sent 4 carriers too.

We are being helped in a very bif way and I really appreciate it.
But we are. With the power being out for essentially the entire island, flooding very widespread, and extensive other infrastructure damage t will be difficult to get resources it across the entire island. Then you have to consider that the landmass of PR is over 3,500 square miles. Oh and if you forgot, it‚Äôs an island a thousand miles away from even Florida. 

While tragic, it is understandable why it is and will take a long time, but help is certainly making its way there.  
Samaritan's Purse was among the first on the ground. Their staff members assembled 50,000 pounds of supplies, including hygiene kits, toiletries, plastic tarps, generators and tools. The organization said it is sending out another aircraft by the end of the weekend through its disaster assistance response team and will carry another 50,000 pounds of supplies.
Dafuq does the year have to do with anything.
Thanks for the reminder that it is the current year, and for the last time "we" are helping them. The federal government has been on the ground for a while now...
Hurricane Maria occurred in 2017.

I don't know what you're trying to say.  Why aren't we time travelers?

This is Current Year, why are you still so shitty?
Because the host of The Apprentice is busy telling basketball players they can't come to his party.
Why don‚Äôt you do some research on the web before posting that question? Help is being delivered! The federal government had help prepositioned before the hurricane hit.  And to the others responding and getting political, can you stop with that shit already?  Go get your karma and gold comments in /r/politics 
it's literally been less than 1 week holy shit
One gold equals four dollars that could have been spent helping Puerto Rico
Why do people get so bothered by those? Like if you live 2,000 miles away, what are you supposed to do?
More than likely his phone, since they just opened up access.
Internet is extremely rare. Claro has a generator to power one of it's antena. There is no communication in the grand majority of the island, there are parts of the island people still don't have information about. It is heartbreaking seen people line up for a courber with signal just to call a family member to say "I am safe, I love you" and move on. 
Puerto Rican here att and claro have some cell service on the metro parts of the Island. T-Mobile has been blacked out for the whole time but they have started to receive some messages a couple of hours ago. Sprint is awol. They say the working telecomunication antennas are at 25%. But the rest of Puerto Rico is shut down I‚Äôve only been able to receive a handful of messages from my family in Lajas but the damage there wasn‚Äôt too severe and they‚Äôre all safe. Hope the same is true for your family members. 
My brothers friend is out there and he has to walk for ages to get it but there's wifi somewhere that he's been able to use to keep in contact with people
Claro also provides Internet services, I'm staying at a family members house and they have a router that's working. My phone which is also Claro, occasionally has Internet and/or phone service.
Claro que si
Depends, maybe they did so only after being asked, in corporation with other providers, or there might even be a regulation for such cases. It may be cynical, but there quite a few evenly likely possible reasons.
The supermarkets I've visited are operating with usual stock and generators. Hell, they're even selling frozen meat. But, there are long lines to get in. The line I made was about 20 minutes to enter and 20 to pay, so they're bearable. That's in the more urban areas, I don't really know how it's going on the more rural areas, but I've heard of people are staying collectively in convention centers and any big building, while food and essentials arrive.
There already have been flights with lots of personnel, including medical and electrical engineers, as well as critical supplies. They'll ramp up more when the airport is safer.

Meanwhile, the vast majority has to come by ship.
They have to FOD walk the runways for heavies. After they get enough people in, then they can clear runways for civilian planes. 
I've seen more in the media about football etc this morning than anything I've heard about PR ..sad.

Ponce has very hard access right now. Very little known other than there are no dead reported there. 
My family lives in Jardines de Ponce and pretty much everything is ok there!
After 4 days we received a single text from good friends in caguas. They stated they were safe. 
My grandparents are in Villalba and still no word from them 
There* are building codes, though at times like this most permitting process will be bogged down and ignored, resulting in an abundance of sub par and shoddy construction.

However, once things have calmed down and gotten back to normal, standard inspections and operations will catch up.

Tilt up requires preform factories. Better for them would be ICF construction. Overall stronger, can be assembled in less than a week, and has between 4-12" thick concrete walls.
Yes, there were standards, but most of puertorican architecture meets the old standard and just barely reach the modern ones.

Source: I remember hearing it yesterday on the radio.
So there is apparently fuel reserves in the island, but there might not be enough gas stations operating to supply or even work, which causes the few ones that work to have excessively long lines (I've heard 6 hours, but I am not sure)
General knowledge of Latin America is pretty bad in the US. The fact that "Latino/Hispanic" isn't a race, that Puerto Rico is American territory, that some countries in LatAm (as in the Southern Cone) are actually doing fairly well etc. Saw a guy on a BPT thread trying to argue that Spaniards were Latino and therefore not white conquistadors üòÇ
Gonna need a source on this. Ray is peurto rican after all....
No, only Americans are people,the rest can die /s.

More seriously, it's quite annoying how people think the only reason the island should be helped is because they are Americans, not because America is the closest country to the island and has a duty to help. 
Thank you, was looking for this. 
It's because of how you guys pronounce your r's.
It's a strange time when I read about aid workers flying *from* Haiti *to* the US to help out after a disaster.
I helped send out a few emergency radios for Port Au Prince ATC operations. They left yesterday I believe. Hopefully they help get air operations running smoother so aid can come in faster. The FAA is mobilizing support equipment and possibly personnel to Puerto Rico.
Why is a server checking passports anyway? They're not law enforcement, why is it any of their business?
The bar you work at doesn't accept non US citizens in it? I don't get it, why would they be kicked out? 
I run into this with my license that says District of Columbia so I'm not surprised. Ignorance is everywhere. 
Not American but I have no fucking clue where Puerto Rico is. Guessing it's one of the Caribbean islands?
Wouldn't be shocked. Hell, I've met people living near the US/Mexican border who don't know Mexico has states. 
[deleted]
That's not completely unprecedented with American Territories.

Texas and Hawaii have their own independent identities as well, and they're actually States.

Guam and American Samoa have their own identities, as well as over 500 Native American Tribes with enough sovereignty to keep an identity intact.

It's one of the cooler aspects of the United States, in my opinion.
Their baseball players who made money in the states played for Puerto Rico against the US. 
FEMA was there before the hurricane made landfall. 
I feel like all the people complaining about everyone else being ignorant have no idea how much is being done to help 
I'd imagine it does matter in as far as to what kind and how much help the US can give legally. Totally agree that basic human needs should be given regardless of their citizenship. Hell we even provide aid to our enemies' people. 
Because frankly that's the way this shitty world is. How much aid do you think the US sends to Africa after horrific natural disasters, and how do you think it compares to the aid it sends to Texas or Florida? 
Yeah, it's bullshit. Puerto Ricans are just as American as anyone else in the States.

"Oh, but it's just a territory"

Yeah, so was Hawaii during Pearl Harbor. That didn't stop us from entering WWII.
At the end of the day, it should not matter what Americans "think" of your nation. We (the US) made a commitment and we should keep it. I am sorry that we have a leader who seems to think that all obligations, even technically domestic ones, are completely optional. I am sorry we are not acting like the America the world expects or needs. 
Yo, you matter to me (and Puerto Rico).

A guy I work with is Puerto Rican and I hope his family is okay.

On a side note, I'll admit my other reasoning is selfish. The food of Puerto Rico is nothing short of AMAZING. My buddy brings in dishes to work that make me want to slap my mama. They're SO GOOD.
After reading the article I was wondering why we're not sending help down there already. It breaks my heart thinking of families trapped with no food or water and destroyed homes while I'm eating my Cheerios.

As a Puerto Rican raised in the lower 48,  I'm sorry, but you're just flat out wrong. Ive had to deal with stupid ass comments my entire life. I've had to explain to many many people that I'm not from Mexico and that everyone in my family was born with a US birth certificate and ssn. A lot of Americans don't know anything about Puerto Rico. 
Really? Cause I've had to explain the status of Puerto Rico to numerous college classmates. Others knew it wasn't a state but clueless as to what it was, and some did actually know it was a territory but not much other than that. 
[deleted]
We should help Puerto Rico because they're people.  What difference does it make if they're a US territory?
They did vote yes for it, in the past referendum actually
> NOW they want to be a state.

Some of us have wanted it for decades and have been rebuffed by the conservatives of the island who demanded we remain "independent." Which is why there was a protest the last time there was a vote. Simplifying the politics of the island doesn't do you any favors. 
They don‚Äôt pay federal taxes.

They voted against becoming a state anyway 
What makes you think we don't?
My friends dad ran our towns electric division for 25yrs, retired with his pension and started his own electric company. He has more money than anyone I know, and he's currently being paid for being down in Florida to help with cleanup too. He's been gone for a week and by the time he comes back he's going to be richer than he already was. Going to Puerto Rico is just going to add to that. 
Do you know any organization set up to help rebuild? My boyfriend and I are thinking about talking our vacation out there and help out. He knows how to build houses and lay concrete while I can do tech stuff and help out. Plus, our money spent will go towards their economy and tourist section which is probably going to suck for awhile after this.

I've got a cousin here in Ohio deploying to the USVI on Wednesday. 
That's awesome but this is gonna take more than just the guardsmen. This is gonna take money, lots of it, and Trump is notoriously cheap.

At this point he'd have to be completely unhinged to not send some financial support to them to help rebuild. This is a US territory, these are American citizens, it would be political suicide to ignore this issue. At least, it *should* political suicide, but after 2016 all bets seem to be off on what ruins a presidential candidacy.

At any rate, I doubt he'll leave Puerto Rico to twist in the wind, but at the same time I question if he'll be providing all the assistance they really need or enough of it. It's easy to deploy the guard, but it remains to be seen if he'll actually follow through on assisting them in the long run.
Puerto Rico doesn't recieve infrastructure funds as much because they aren't a State.

I have to imagine that Maria is going to alter the Statehood debate in  a significant way.
Most likely somewhere between their territory status and that they have had a track record of borrowing money they aren't capable of paying back.


I'd probably go with what I said first. I'm far from an expert on the situation though. 
Well they can't exactly e-transfer it with the power down...
Some cell towers are up and working. I can reach my dad who has AT&T but my mom, who lives half a mile from him, can't be reached on Sprint.
OJ would like to have a word with you.
This. Senate Republicans were hesitating to raise funds for FLORIDA. Puerto Rico is fucked in a few months when the political pressure is off, and they need billions to rebuild. 
> are a looming threat.

They aren't *today's* threat. Try to focus.
Okay, but this would be a *really* good time for him to use his position and influence mobilize private citizens to help. Instead of that, he's bitching about Steph Curry.
> obviously he is incapable of multitasking several things,

Yes, and  his efficiency and competency for the job is  extremely evident from things such as spending valuable time on and off camera inciting national witch hunts against athletes for doing the most relatively mundane shit and generally coming off as unhinged as possible.
Wow, this shitty comment for gold?  Did you give it to yourself?

Trump could be marshaling a nationwide response to the hurricane and the Mexican earthquake. Instead, he's being divisive and destructive as usual. 

It's as if people don't understand what leadership is. You unify people toward a set of goals. Trump is the worst leader I've ever seen. The country is more divided than ever. Or, rather, it's only unified in opposition to him as a leader. 
No one is saying he can't multitask. He's doing an amazing job fucking up many things all at once. I guess we just assumed this was another one of those things since they're brown people. I've still got my fingers crossed, though. It's not too late for him to blame Puerto Rico on Twitter. 

EDIT: ....aaaaannnnnd he kind of blamed it on Puerto Rico's debt in a tweet.

If you figure anything out, let me know! 
It's also debated whether or not PR wants to be a state, with their recent elections going both ways. They would gain representation in Congress, but would have to pay federal taxes, including income taxes. That can be tens of thousands of dollars per year for some people, making people question if it's worth it.
So im gonna hop in here for a few things. In the past statehood has dominated the vote, but the referendums have always had vague rules that lad to nothing. Second statehood would benefit one party over the other because the parties are build around wanting statehood (PNP) wanting to be a commonwealth (PPD) and wanting independence (PPI). it wouldn't upset any power balance  that's bull, they was the government works the party in power is the party that leads, that wouldn't change like, at all.

The truth of the matter is the USA makes more money if we aren't a state, and if you don't believe me look up the Jones Act, that is exactly who it will never be a priority. 
20% turn out? Its like they are a state already 
That's actually kind of terrifying and I never thought of that being a huge issue after a hurricane, wow 
You entirely missed my point. I had gotten around the paywall when I posted this comment. But in these rare circumstances when a you're responsible for sharing information that could help save lives, maybe not put a paywall on your site for just that one article.

You can, but unless you NEED to, don‚Äôt.

President Trump literally signed disaster declaration for Puerto Rico. Your ignorance is showing. 
How is that even relevant? That you follow this sort of bullshit and do not know that the government and military is helping in Puerto Rico says something about you.

Tilt-up wouldn't require preform factories for simple buildings... it would most likely be done on site with just some wood framing and plenty of rebar. 

Actually, it requires fewer materials than ICF and is similarly quick to build. 

Not comparing the quality, just saying it's not a bad option if you're just trying to get a structure up. 
We got fuel in yesterday. People are making 10 hour lines for $15-$20 gas. 
> *So there is apparently fuel reserves in the island.*

LOL. 'Reserves'? My uncle, a civil engineer, spent five years as the Chief Engineer in charge of building a quite large refinery over by Ponce.

In fact, there is a long list of refineries on PR, which is understandable as most (but not all) of the power-plants (more than two hands-full) are petroleum-fired of one type or another.

15 power-plants of the solar, wind, coal, heavy fuel oil, diesel, and liquified gas variety plus 21 hydro-electric plants 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority

And 37 refineries of various sorts owned by either "Caribbean Petroleum Corp" or "Shell Chem Yabucoa Inc".

But yeah, the problem right now is that the gas station's fuel pumps are operated by electricity... and there is currently no way of getting electricity TO the gas stations (and they're not exactly wired so one can hook up a generator to them - gonna take specialized knowledge to do that).
One of my employees was arguing with me that mexico was South America, he would not give up. I can't remember if it was the same guy because it was a while ago but we also had this argument:

Me: You do realize that Mexico is a seperate country Brazil or Guatemala or others like that, right.

Todd: (and i'm not stretching the truth here) Yeah, but if you're from brazil then you're mexican and still from mexico.

Me: No you're Brazilian.

Todd: BRAZIL IS IN MEXICO!!!!

He thought he bested me because at that point I gave up. He was pretty smug for the rest of the day. Later another guy was showing him google maps. His mind was imploding and you could see the horror in his eyes when not only did he realize that Brazil was a country all it's own, but in SOUTH AMERICA!!!!
There was only one world history class in my whole high school and it was for seniors. One class for one year out of my 12 years of schooling. US education has always been a joke but we've totally fallen by the wayside. There's no excuse for that in the world we live in.
> The fact that "Latino/Hispanic" isn't a race

It's as much a race as any arbitrary races. "Asian" isn't a race either.
I took African studies in college and learned a fuck ton. I wish I would have taken Latin American or South American too!!
Latinos themselves don't always know that. When they've had to fill out census information at my work, several have asked what to circle because there is no Latino/Hispanic
I get that thinking Spaniards weren't white conquistadors is silly but most Latinos are so mixed that asking us for a "race" is stupid. Are we supposed to say "I'm a third native, a third black, a third white?" What if that's only one side of the family? Am I supposed to list all 6 races in my family tree? It doesn't mean anything. I'm still just some sort of brown. I just say Latino/Hispanic/Puerto Rican and am done with it.
To be fair, it's easy to mix up latinos with the term hispanic. I guess in the back of my mind I knew the difference but I could easily see making the same mistake in conversation.
Well, Spaniards are in fact Latinos if you go by the actual meaning of that word outside of the USA (anyone who speaks a language derived from Vulgar Latin).  Under that definition Spaniards, French, Italians, Portugueses and Romanians are Latinos as well.

Now I don‚Äôt get how your friend got the part about not being white conquistadors because one thing has nothing to do with the other.
It's just as bad on American knowledge of Europe. I have had adult friends literally still think that there are no free countries in Europe and that they are all assigned jobs like a far dystopian communist country. The other day one even said Europeans know they will die if they get sick (because they have universal healthcare) so the just accept it and are not free to protest. 

It's maddening the ignorance of Americans. Here I am living in Europe and they are telling me that I'm not free and my healthcare is bad. I've had both, Universal Healthcare is so much better. 
> Saw a guy on a BPT thread trying to argue that Spaniards were Latino and therefore not white conquistadors

But they're _brown_!   So they don't count.
His mother tho
America isn't the closest country to the island...
It's certainly not the only reason, but it's a big reason that the US in particular should focus on helping them. The whole point of having a country is to help each other out when it's needed.
It just makes it more poignant, like if a woman refused to help a drowning kid and you had to point out to her that it was her own nephew.  
Proximity means nothing.  Transportation is easy and cheap.  Any country with say... An aircraft carrier could park it nearby and use it to provide power and water if they wanted to help out.
Legally speaking, it's the bar's responsibility to ensure the customer is over the legal drinking age, so some require proof. At Buffalo Wild Wings even my dad who clearly is over 21 needs to show ID for a drink; company policy and the like
Hyperbole and such.
It's because us is extremely strict on id checking for bars, and typically foreigners need to show their passports. 

This bouncer didn't realize PR is in the US and that they were citizens.  
Google Maps is your friend.
> Puerto Rico

It's an island to the right of Haiti/The Dominican (which happen to be one Island which few people seem to know too) the size of Flanders.
I respect you for admitting you don't know
This is actually normal in most nations. Thats not unique to the US, in the UK I am Scottish, in Germany you can be Bavarian, in Russia you can be a Muscovite or a Syberian. 
Every state has their own independent identity. 
Don't forget about New Yorkers.

Hey I'm walking here!
Texas amd Hawaii don't compete against us in the Olympics. To use the previous example.

They also pay Federal Personal Income Taxes. PR does not.
Marines too
Nor are they actually helping themselves.
> Yeah, so was Hawaii during Pearl Harbor. That didn't stop us from entering WWII.

TIL.  I had no idea.   Of course, if you grow up with something (like Hawaii being a state), it seems like it has _always_ been that way.  
I absolutely agree with you that Puerto Ricans are Americans, but the attack on Pearl Harbor was an attack on a US military base, not so much the Japanese attacking the territory of Hawaii.  
  
The base could have been in Japan and the reaction would have been the same.
I'm not trying to diminish your life experience in anyway, but my aunt is of Dominican parents, but born and raised in Brooklyn and she's told to go back to Mexico all the time. Some people are just shitty. Not most, but they're there unfortunately.
It's a bit convenient to boycott a vote and then claim low voter turnout is a result of that boycott. I'm not necessarily saying it wasn't a result of the boycott, but it's impossible to tell one way or the other. 
We can't help all people. Helping other people reduces our ability to help our people. These are great reasons that it matters. We will always provide more help to those similar to us.
That's not entirely true. They pay everything but federal income tax. The median household income of Peurto Rico is less than $20k, so they wouldn't be paying much federal income tax anyways.
>Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, **Puerto Ricans are also required to pay most US federal taxes**, with the major exception being that most residents do not have to pay the federal personal income tax.

Their most recent statehood vote says otherwise
Actually, their most recent referendum was overwhelmingly in favour.
I have such mixed feelings about voluntourism.  There aren't that many great projects for the average unskilled person (particularly someone who doesn't speak the language) and it can end up taking a job away from a local person.  Most people can do more good by giving money.

Since your boyfriend has legit construction skills, I'd contact Habitat.  Obviously plenty of non-skilled people volunteer with Habitat, but skilled people are particularly useful. Habitat Haiti and a few others aren't even looking for volunteers, just donors.

Maybe ask in /r/puertorico if any specific families are interested in help and have a place for you to set up camp.


All the organizations have been flooded with volunteer applications.
Global Giving puts 96% of their money towards programs, Catholic Relief Services puts 94% of their money towards programs, American Jewish World Service puts 87%.  Those are the three that have been vetted by Charity Navigator, the others are more of an open question.  (Global Giving is a middleman organization linking smaller projects with donors, so there may be additional admin costs, Catholic Relief Services and American Jewish World Service do direct work)

Everyone should research before they give money, but a lot of money does go to on the ground work done by non-profits.
That's not exactly true is it. I don't disagree that we could do more, and should do. We didn't do enough in the initial aftermath and were caught with our pants down, but it's a bit insulting to the 2000 troops who are now out there.

Not only is that the largest U.K. forces deployment anywhere in the world at the moment, but we had RFA Mounts Bay on standby for the Hurricane season and it had specialist engineers on board as well as several tonnes of aid. They went straight in and stopped a dangerous petrol depot leak in Anguilla and restored power to the only hospital on the island, for example. They've been helping clear debris and restoring power over several islands, as well as an air corp which has been air lifting supplies and rescuing people - they rescued a mother and children from on upturned boat just off Haiti (I believe it was Haiti) just the other day.

HMS Ocean was soon sent out and has now also arrived with another 60 tonnes of aid and more troops as well as loads more helicopters (seeing as it's a helicopter carrier basically).

We don't have a permanent base in the Caribbean unlike some countries so it makes it trickier in terms of logistics, and we do need to release more funds but to suggest that we haven't responded at all is a bit ridiculous, when nations who are just next door or have bases in the region could be criticised in much the same way. 

I'm not knocking aid organisations, but they can take donations and buy as much aid as they want, but without boots on the ground and helicopters and ships to deliver it and provide support, it doesn't get anywhere.
But does Islamic Relief USA have existing people on the ground in these countries?  One of the problems with disaster relief is that you need to have existing connections to really do good work.  Looking at their website, Islamic Relief USA seems better prepared to help with the genocide in Myanmar and the famine in Yemen.


The Civil Air Patrol just flew my dad and many other pilots down there on a C-17. There is help, but I have no idea if there's enough. Won't be able to hear much from him for about a week.
He's already opened federal aid for PR.

stop freaking out for 5 seconds and take a breath.  Every fucking thread about PR is people like you shouting about stuff that needs to be done, then moving the goalposts when they find out it's already being done.

PR had a natural disaster.  The same shit is happening for them  that happens anywhere in the US.  Be patient and contribute what you can instead of jerking yourself off over how inept our government is.

I swear some people would literally stand on the back of a drowning man just so they could shout complaints a bit further.
Jeff Sessions called Hawaii "some island in the Pacific". I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for this administration to do much for some island in the Caribbean full of brown people that's not even a state.
The Senate just approved spending $83 billion more on the Dept of Defense.  
Emergency relief funds are hardly ever "loans" in the sense you have to pay them back.

Really what your husband should do is volunteer with an organization for long term volunteer work.  It isn't necessarily a good idea to have even skilled volunteers show up at a disaster site- it all needs to be coordinated by people with local knowledge.  If you read Paul Farmer's book on Haiti after the earthquake, it was a very messy situation when people arrived with their own volunteer ideas but without proper guidance, a unified mission, etc.  I'm not saying there is no way to volunteer right now, but you should be thinking long term.

[Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) has already deployed teams to Mexico, but they look for a 9-12 month commitment.   

[International Medical Corps](https://careers.internationalmedicalcorps.org/volunteer.html) wants medical volunteers who can travel on a 72 hour notice for 2-8 weeks in an emergency.

[The Himalayan Cataract Project](http://www.cureblindness.org/get-involved/partner/volunteer) seeks fully-licensed, board-certified ophthalmologists for short term volunteer projects and to host trainees for short visits to the US for training.

[The Maven Project](http://www.mavenproject.org/get-involved/volunteer-physician/) matches physicians with clinics in need in their area.  4hrs or more a month or 6 months or more.
I would think so, aren't there more boricuas in NY than PR?
They've really done a great job with both Harvey and Irma, and now Maria. 
I mean honestly... I work at Lowes and we sell nestle water... any time something local happens where they have volunteers we call them and they will almost always donate multiple pallets to bring water out to first responders and such. 

Not saying it‚Äôs on the scale of an entire island, but most companies are willing to help if you ask directly. 
Shhh that doesn't fit the narrative that everyone here's trying to promote 
Seriously, you can't google something before turning a natural disaster into a stupid political comment? 
HE DIDNT DO IT FAST ENOUGH OR SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS! /s
How the president spends one moment mocking NFL and NBA players while disaster strikes American soil is absolutely despicable.  There is no reason to do so and downplaying this should not be a priority.
A lot of people on this website only have a moral compass that extends to hating the right. 
There are tilt up concrete pre-fab factories for large projects that need to be built to pretty exacting specs, but I don‚Äôt think he realized that it can be done on site for smaller scale projects. 
I think he's thinking of something else. 
As long as the space is available, and there is a plant nearby, site-cast tilt up is definitely more common.  Factory pre-cast, as OP describes, is more commonly used when the site is too tight tight, when weather is an issue, or when a plant is not available.
>  in the entire developed world

Let's not go *too* far. Don't get me wrong, ICFs are great, and are definitely the right choice for places that need to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, there are many parts of the world, including most of North America away from the coasts and the deserts, where wood is a whole lot cheaper than concrete and thus the right passive house choice is [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_insulated_panel) construction instead.
ICF also requires machinery for extruding the foam blocks. I‚Äôm not sure you can just set that up ASAP. 
Dear god.
Well sucks for you, but that's not the case for everyone in the States. We had multiple years of world history during our secondary education where I live.
We had history every year. Seniors got to take AP history and get college credit for it. It was taught by the football coach. Sounds strange but he was probably the best teacher at our high school. He used to be a defense attorney. His AP class was considered by most to be the most difficult class in our school, harder than AP Calc and physics. The bridge in schools is pretty crazy honestly as to what is offered. 
Education isn't an excuse anymore. Access to information is nearly unlimited across the social spectrum. 

EDIT: I'm going to go ahead and post the comment chain that lead me to expound on this in order to try to cut down on the misunderstandings. 

>>Education is about more than just facts though. It's about the philosophy behind learning and tools to do so successfully.

>The fact that people don't grasp this is ironically a symptom of the failure of education in America. I believe it is the single biggest problem we have and the root of all of our other problems.

No. I believe it's simply human nature that's at the root of our 'other problems'. Many serious social issues are founded on aspects of our nature that you cannot 'educate' away. Education is merely one facet of the modern humans development. I'm however, speaking in the context of 'education' as it pertains to the modern institution of education. Scholastic learning and all that jazz.

You can scientifically prove that black people aren't genetically inferior to whites directly in front of a well educated racist over and over. But if you don't budge the emotional and tribal components that make them who they are, then you're not going to get anywhere.

As a matter of fact, many of the very worst humans throughout history were very well and classically educated in fields of both science and philosophy.

No, I believe your statement has very little truth in it. I do believe that the system of education in the US has failed its citizens, but I don't think that has much to do with stupid people not knowing how to google Puerto Rico.

While I think that providing a better system of education might go a long way towards solving a lot of our social problems, the desire to learn and change cannot be taught. It has to come from within. While providing a better framework for this sort of self discovery might hurry the process along, it in no way even remotely guarantees it. 

I think that people give education too much credit. In a world where you can literally learn anything at the press of a key, there's no longer any legitimate excuse for the average person to remain ignorant of simple facts, and to hold opinions contrary to those simple facts. 

I don't believe you. I moved around a lot and every state I went to had a history class, if not multiple. K-12 and required courses in college.
Lmao it's certainly not a joke, my education was fine, I had four years of history classes and geography. No need to blanket a whole system off of your experience. 
Mine was Freshman year and we mostly colored maps of Rome and finger painted cavemen.
I call bullshit you had world history more then once you have to take several histories to even graduate 
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4217  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/31744)
Eh, anyone can learn as much as they want about history without the need of a teacher. I don't think history class should be completely omitted, but I don't think we need to beef it up either, there's plenty of stuff that benefits more from having an instructor.

edit: Actually, considering how difficult it seemingly is for history textbooks to avoid being propaganda...fuck history class
Wait, are there any history classes in middle school?
Dude! You don't need a special, "studies," class!  OMG! Look at a globe! Browse the internet! Google world maps! WTH happened to the American educational system! THIS! THIS is why I homeschooled! 
We know. We're just not normally 1 race, which means there's no real option otherwise. Hispanic is, in practical terms, a catchall for "I'm a mutt that speaks Spanish"
[deleted]
What's you're thinking of is Latin. Latino is a different word that means Latin American, which obviously is anyone from Latin America. Hispanic is another word that just means people that come from Spanish speaking countries or countries with a connection to Spain. So for example, Brazilians are considered latinos a lot of times, but not Hispanic. 
Yea but in modern terms they're not Latinxs
Your friends sounds more like the exception not the rule. Where are they from?
It sounds like your friends aren't too bright then. 
I live outside the US (I am an American).  And while the knowledge of the US is a bit better over here (the UK) than American's knowledge of elsewhere, its still not good.

People know what they are told by the news media and what information they glean from films, but few people know much about America (but then again, I don't think Americans know very much about their country either)
Dude, America IS the island.  Pretty sure you can't get closer than that.

I mean would people be saying, f'gedda'bout Hawaii!  They're not real.
Considering that island *is* America, I think it's the closest country. Also US Virgin Islands are the closest to it, so US is still closer than other countries. But if you don't count those, then I guess Britain is the closest one, since British Virgin Islands are right next to it. 
So they were thrown out because they couldn't prove they were over 21, not because they couldn't prove they were American.
Ah, that makes more sense, if they showed the staff their Puerto Rican ID and the staff didn't accept it because they didn't know whether or not it was valid.
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. My Mexican buddy uses his Mexican passport all the time at the bars. No one gives a fuck. 
Can't I just say I don't know where it is and have 500 comments telling me the exact same thing instead?
I learn all my stuffs from comments by reddit users. You know, because wiki and such content cannot be trusted.
I don't know about that. I ended up in North Korea once.
I understand that perfectly well. You have your Wallonians, Bretons, Sicilians, and all that stuff. But you couldn't consider them national identities, just Ethnic ones.

With the exception of British nations, of course. Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man are unique enough to hold their own national identities.

I guess it does sound a bit conceited, though.
Texas doesn't have its own olympic team however.  Neither do guam nor American Samoa.  People are missing the point of what I was saying.  
Ah, the infamous Brooklyn rage. Truly an icon in American culture.
It's weird, right? Hawaii used to be a territory... And before that it was it's own Kingdom.

And before that it was a bunch of Island Nations in a constant state of warfare.

Hawaii is definitely one of the more unique states.
but theyre OUR people. we have to help them. to help PR is to help ourselves.
So you're saying they only pay into the social safety nets they are receiving?
Yup and they give to pay port taxes to the US. Since US only allows American vessels into it's ports. AKA the Jones Act.
Well no income tax is huge. The majority they pay are social security and Medicaid which as US citizens they get to collect.
The most recent vote only had a 23% turnout, mostly due to the "status quo" party conducting a boycott.

Do we accept a 23% turnout or do we require a higher bar?
You mean that totally legit, not at all biased, super duper conclusive vote that pollsters unanimously denounced for no apparent reason? 
I remember reading an article at the time saying that tons of people didn't vote because it was a political maneuver and they just boycotted. At the time the actual polls of the people showed they were against it.
Are you sure that is an official website? Seems unlikely they would use a wix site domain 
Thanks for the heads up and the links. I should have mentioned we both speak passable Spanish.

I know I'd be pretty useless but at least my boyfriend who lay concrete down or do electrical work. Plus, we want to support local businesses and hotels who are going to massively struggle due to this. 
If we left all the rebuilding in the world to skilled locals nothing would ever get fixed after natural disasters. I think the skilled locals that can build homes and have the energy to do so are most likely working on their own. 
Unskilled individuals volunteering IS NOT taking a job from a local person. They are doing work for free for which a local person would not be receiving compensation for. Any PR citizen with building experience is already being put to work believe me 
And to piggyback on this, if there is no electricity and scarce food, water, and fuel, how will the local businesses and hotels be able to accommodate you?  The island (and the hardest hit Caribbean islands) are not in a place to accommodate tourists yet; you become a burden.  
Islamic Relief USA is very active in the United States, I remember them being one of the constellation of groups assisting after Katrina 12 years ago. That was the first thing that caused me to re-assess my then-nasty view of Muslims. They have been involved in most major US disasters since. I'm not sure with Puerto Rico or Mexico as much.

Edit: They have local partners in Mexico. However, they are telling people to keep an eye out for updates in regards to Puerto Rico. 
But relief funds also aren't given out as cash.  The money is used to buy supplies.  Handing money to PR politicians and officials is a good way to have the money disappear.
hey old people and children have a lot in common
facebook-tier comment
Walk and chew gum at the same time? Trump has been commenting on Puerto Rico the whole time and is working closely with the governor to get them whatever they need. Taking 30 seconds out of his day to bash athletes for not standing for the American Flag is not a total consumption of his time. It is a total consumption of yours though apparently. 
Up-playing it shouldn't be a priority either. I saw more coverage in the media about a tweet than the problems in PR. You'd think they would be smart enough to pick out what is important at the time but nope, gotta get them clicks and views! 
He definitely be using his twitter time to remind Americans there are other Americans in need of help right now, rather than complaining about the NFL.
I live in Missouri we had a history class for every year of school, now did they gloss over some things, yep
We had a mixture of U.S history and Texas history down here. World History was implemented in a way.  


Edit: Oh my god won't yall shut the fuck up about the word too.
  
so do you mean you had it split up? or you had to take world history I-II. My school in the U.S. had a world history class, and an AP world history. but obviously that was optional. The real problem i had was the variability in quality of teachers. most of them were great, but some would just talk for 80 minutes and then assign reading and a question sheet. I did not do well. But i also struggle with history in general, remembering names/dates/events is difficult for me.
Yeah living in VA we had tons of American History and I remember having 1 year of world history.  
After traveling around and living in Asia, I'm amazed at the difference in education here. The actual schooling is worse, in my opinion, but the culture heavily promotes the idea of being students for life. Everyone studies something here (frequently a foreign language, but sometimes programming or something else) all via self study, internet browsing, and asking peers who know more about the subject than them. The biggest educational failure of America is that most of the citizens simply stop learning once they graduate.
Education is about more than just facts though. It's about the philosophy behind learning and tools to do so successfully.
I'd say education is still an issue, but what you need to teach people is that they can't "not care"  and that they needed to learn to research and explore.

I'm an European from relatively poor post comm country with education that's not amazing or world renowned. I'm from a poor family out of a rural village with 700 occupants and no school. I make less than national average salary as well. None of that stopped me from learning 4 languages fluently (my native language, English, Polish and German) or from spending hours on Wikipedia, scientific journals and other sources to find information about numerous topics I've not been taught in school but found very interesting or in some cases even embarrassing to not know about.

Information is there for everyone, people just need to care and strive towards something.
I do not agree with your sentiment. I think the biggest failure of our education system is the method. 

Speech > Repetition > Playback. 

We are trained from a very young age just to accept "knowledge".  
the problem with unlimited access to information is where to begin. you say they should know puerto ricans are american citizens, but why? i mean they could be learning about climate change instead, or maybe personal finance, or business, or engineering, or coding, or any number of other topics that might be more pertinent to their lives. that's why education in junior high and high school is still important and shouldn't be treated and funded as poorly as it is.
I absolutely do not disagree with you.

However, I think you are drastically underestimating the failure of the American education system.
You would do well to remember the allegory of the cabe. 

Knowledge being available does not make it desirable to know. 

That is the point of education. To establish a base of knowledge. 

US Education has failed at this for some decades now. 
That's a horrible approach. You don't know the thing you don't know until they show them to you. Why would I read about LatAm in the first place? why would I be tempted t know about that? basic knowledge is only basic knowledge because they teach you it. If they don't teach you about it expecting you can google anything, then you'll end with very skewed ideas, and not knowing about anything. Education is the biggest pilar in society and it might be breaking appart. 
You should look up Connectivist Learning Theory. "A key feature of connectivism is that much learning can happen across peer networks that take place online. In connectivist learning, a teacher will guide students to information and answer key questions as needed, in order to support students learning and sharing on their own. Students are also encouraged to seek out information on their own online and express what they find. A connected community around this shared information often results."

There is more to it and the implications of this new learning theory is that instruction should be designed to teach learners how to find information and knowledge not designed to teach information and knowledge itself. It is based on a new epistemology of distributed knowledge and there is much debate as to whether it is truly a "learning theory" but it's impact on the way educators and instructional designers form their instruction in this digital era is very evident. The boom in open source education, MOOCs, Wikis, free online courses is an example. My point is education is on threshold of tapping into all this available knowledge in an effective way. 
   
I had to take two history classes, one focused on America before WW2, the other focused on a very broad view of world history up to and including colonialism. 

So basically I learned a fucking lot about colonialism, and a bit about the Greeks, romans, and other ancient civilizations. And I was in the AP (advanced placement) classes. 
I took world history in 7th grade, 8th grade was us history, 9th was Geography, 10th was World History, 11th was US History and 12th was US Government. 
Not OP. I *need* someone to verbally make history come to life for me. That isn't commonly achieved (for me) through written word. It's just how my brain works. Finding a teacher that brings a subject to life is a rarity in my educational experience, so I totally get what OP means. 
Ah, La Tinks, the Hispanic Tinkerbell.
Central California.   The red sliver in a blue state
Lies lies lies! No offense, but as a Spaniard myself, who has had the chance to travel around europe, I can assure you that EU's general knowledge of US is infinately greater than the US's of europe. Heck generally we have this class subject known as history, that is taught since almost elementary school, and mostly we get to even study some of the states history. Remember that europe were the ones to "conquest" america, so it is part of our history too.

Issue comes america lives in the 60s, where no other country could compete with you economically, but in 2017 that 60s view is useless, the world changed.
Presumably. Unless they were showing PR driver's licences and the server didn't accept them.
Sure. It's a Caribbean island southeast of Florida, east of Cuba and Hispaniola.
Close! You have to pretend to know where it is...be blatantly wrong and 500 people will be waiting to correct you.
It's like when you search for a solution to a random problem with your PC and all the google result are just forum replies with "google it"
Cuba is 90 miles south of Florida, Puerto Rico is some 700 miles east of Cuba across Haiti/Dominican Republic. 
Depends, the Catalonians are having an independence referendum soon on secceding from Spain. They're a seperate nation under the banner of Spain, which is dominated by Castile. The Belgians do consider themselves to be seperate nations under one banner too I beleive. The French are are for the most part a unitary state, but Germany as a nation state is multiple nations in a federation. Bavarians and Swabians for instance speak slightly different languages to standard German. Most European states are regional unifications of clusters of peoples conquored by the local hegemon or unified for defence. Germany and Italy both only became nations about 150 years ago. Now that I think about it, from a European perspective the USA is more monolithic and monocultural than we are.
>You have your Wallonians, Bretons, Sicilians, and all that stuff. But you couldn't consider them national identities, just Ethnic ones.

Yeah... You go ahead and visit any of those places and make that claim. Let me know how that goes for you.
This was already explained a bit lower in this comment chain, but I was talking about his "We're all just people so we should help everyone" sentiment.

Of course PR are our people and I fully support helping them like any other US person in trouble.
But they also have to follow a bunch of shitty laws that should not apply to an island, and have the US do whatever they want with no recourse.
I'm saying you would be making the same mistake as Romney did with his 47% comment. They don't pay federal income tax but there are other taxes besides that. 
>Well no income tax is huge.

Not really because the average wage in Puerto Rico is so low compared to the states. Most residents wouldn't actually owe any federal income taxes even if they were subject to them because of deductions and their low incomes. Plus they still have to pay a local income tax, which is just as high as the federal income tax rate. 
People who don‚Äôt vote shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when the ballot option they didn‚Äôt want wins. Too bad for them, we can‚Äôt hold up democracy because some people won‚Äôt vote.
It's tough for me to buy into the boycott thing. If you want to say no, go vote no and overwhelmingly win the no vote then. When you just sit back and don't vote, and then the only represented population we have voted 97% in favour, that tells me that the people who actually care about the situation enough to vote on it want statehood. Anyone else should be treated as indifferent, which is *not* necessarily a no vote.
It really isn't that simple.  Lots of people want to volunteer for disasters, but do they speak the language?  do they have skills?  are the coming to promote their own pet project?  I'm not telling people they shouldn't volunteer, but it isn't as simple as "all the professionals are busy."  
They don't have power in PR right now or reliable access to water in many places.  They're not doing a ton of building.

Voluntourism *is* problematic:

[Research in South Africa and elsewhere has found that ‚Äúorphan tourism‚Äù ‚Äî in which visitors volunteer as caregivers for children whose parents died or otherwise can‚Äôt support them ‚Äî has become so popular that some orphanages operate more like opportunistic businesses than charities, intentionally subjecting children to poor conditions in order to entice unsuspecting volunteers to donate more money. Many ‚Äúorphans,‚Äù it turns out, have living parents who, with a little support, could probably do a better job of raising their children than some volunteer can. And the constant arrivals and departures of volunteers have been linked to attachment disorders in children.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/magazine/the-voluntourists-dilemma.html?mcubz=0)

[Research has found that volunteering in health settings can be detrimental, even if the volunteers don‚Äôt realize it. Volunteers often over-estimate their positive impact. Licensed doctors can also inadvertently cause harm in these settings. A 2006 study referred to physicians going abroad short-term to repair fistulas (tears between the vaginal wall and bladder or colon, caused by prolonged obstructed labor) as ‚Äúfistula tourism.‚Äù Doctors unfamiliar with this procedure could unintentionally botch the surgery, making later repairs more complex.](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-trouble-with-medical-voluntourism/)

[At the Grace/Fuller project, though, I am wrestling with the subtle social implications of volunteering. I am heartened by the fact that the Haitian homeowners and we Americans are working side by side. But to my alarm, I learn that the construction work stops each time the Americans depart because of lack of funds‚Äîleaving the Haitians waiting around until another group of ‚Äúsaviors‚Äù arrives...Grace manager Jeune points to a ‚Äúfailed project‚Äù down the road, where an American church insisted on building houses next to the church it had partnered with, without addressing the community‚Äôs poverty. The houses went up, the volunteers went home, Haitian families moved in, but the residents‚Äîwith no jobs, little education, and no professional skills‚Äîcontinued to beg for food. ‚ÄúThe houses didn‚Äôt really change anything,‚Äù says Jeune...I also hear examples of volunteer programs that imposed themselves‚Äîand their values‚Äîon the locals, rather than partnering with the community in a way that showed respect for and interest in it. David Diggs, who founded Beyond Borders to fight child slavery in Haiti, eventually stopped bringing volunteers. ‚ÄúThe saddest part for me was seeing how it felt for people in the community to have foreigners come in and ignore the cultural riches. The volunteers saw themselves as rescuing people,‚Äù he says.](https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-01-15/volunteer-vacations-rewards-risks)

I'm not an international development person, but I have experience as a both an employee and a volunteer at domestic non-profits.  I have a degree that overlaps domestic/international work, so I know people who work at NGOs.  I've done a little bit of volunteer management.  

I wish people would look for long term volunteer opportunities in their own communities and donate money to vetted international groups instead of looking to volunteer for a couple of days in an exotic locale.  
I'm not at all trying to put them down, but boots on the ground and pre-existing connections matter a lot in a crisis.
Also from Missouri. Sure we had history every year but I only had world history for one year of high school. I took AP World History but my friends that didn't take the AP version said they didn't really learn anything. 
Did your history books refer to the civil rights movement as "trouble brewing"?  
So are ya chinese or japanese?
Gloss over things?  Yep, like the [Moro Massacre](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/clemensmoromassacre.html).  Mark Twain thought it was important enough to write about, but my history classes made it seem like the Filipinos were just so happy to have Americans 'liberate' them.  
Texas History is pretty badass. World History too.
Is that a typo? Too?
I thought names/dates/events were difficult for me too, till I realized the wealth of crap I know now about some TV show, book, and movie series that have a canon universe.  Now I realize I just didn't try hard enough. 
My school did European history, then a class about current global issues, then American history, then civics.I feel like I learned a lot about countries outside America, but actually dont remember anything about South America being talked about.
But where in Asia? Asia is an entire continent and cultural attitudes and furthermore the access that people have to education isn't uniform. I live in South Asia and for certain while most people where I live would like to be able to study, a bunch of people simply cannot for one reason or another, and certainly aren't self-studying through the internet. 
Yes. I also lived in Asia for three years, and there's simply just a huge  general cultural difference when it comes to personal development. In Japan, at least in art, perfection is something to be pursued but never achieved. They seem to be more likely to apply themselves toward the perfection of any given field. 

I would suggest that has a lot to do with religious influences. Buddhism, shinto, daoism, et al. 

As I've seen elsewhere on this thread, I think a move towards more communal learning and less of a focus on self reliance in the classroom might be a good step in the right direction as far as education goes.  
The fact that people don't grasp this is ironically a symptom of the failure of education in America.  I believe it is the single biggest problem we have and the root of all of our other problems.
Philosophy of learning doesn't help on the standardized assessments so it is not taught.
Amen! Spoken like a true educator. As I posted above:

Look up Connectivist Learning Theory. "A key feature of connectivism is that much learning can happen across peer networks that take place online. In connectivist learning, a teacher will guide students to information and answer key questions as needed, in order to support students learning and sharing on their own.

The boom in open source education, MOOCs, Wikis, free online courses is an example. My point is education is on threshold of tapping into all this available knowledge in an effective way. 

 
So much of this. I have done the education thing and one of the worst aspects of teaching to me is the cohort of students who are convinced that me standing up trying to educate them about the world is a waste of their time because they can Google everything. But ask them a question they don't have any idea how to answer and they look at you like you are an asshole.  The desire to learn/ do more than navel gaze has been effectively beaten cultured out of them. 
I suspect that you have a deep hunger to learn, in part because education isn't denigrated in your part of the world.

Bush41 is where I think we, (Americans), began calling labeling the educated as elites.
Yeah, but you're European. They have magical language powers. 

Source: am American
I'm gonna take a Guess that you live in the Balkans, Bulgaria. 
Sorry, but America spends more per student on Jr High and High School education than almost any country in the world. 

The essential problem is not lack of funding. It is the culture of disdain for knowledge that is prevalent among Americans, both youth and adults. They don't want to learn and don't value learning. 
My teacher was from R√©publique de C√¥te d'Ivoire so it was really neat to hear about her experiences and firsthand knowledge. Plus I loved her accent. 
Well I live in Scotland at the moment.  Scottish knowledge of US history and geography isn't too good (and the Scots had a profound impact on the southeastern US where I am from).

Most Scots I speak to (and they are a lovely, friendly people) once I tell them that my family lived in North Carolina, they have no idea where that is.
I've had a Florida ID not accepted in Massachusetts. Some bars are just overzealous.
The laws make it so that the server can go to jail for serving a minor, thus the server can deny those they are not familiar with in terms of ID. The location should have a book though, showing all 50 state IDs plus territories.

If someone in Kansas for example had never seen a PR license, and didn't feel comfortable serving that person, that's the servers right, but management should be made aware.
Thanks. TIL Hispaniola is an island. I need to learn more about Central America apparently 
There is a whole thing about that.
It's called Cunningham's law
Germans certainly don't count themselves as being a federation of nations. There are regional identities, sure, and it's a federal state, but there is just one nation.
There have been numerous referenda on independence, they've all failed badly.
And they also borrow insane amounts of money and can't pay it back.
Also the white washing of their culture and language. While The official language is Spanish, English is the language used for all government affairs. This leaves a big portion of the country who doesn't speak English fluently at a disadvantage in society. 
I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too bad of a deal. The federal government still sends way more there than the collect. 
[Economist article on net expenditures](https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union)
If you really want to have a say in a congressional or senatorial race, move to a state. Same as you would if you lived in DC.
Sure we can.

Some things are important enough that winning a vote with such low turnout isn't acceptable.

That's why we require 51 votes to pass something in the senate. Votes that abstain don't lower the required total, they count as a "no." That's why some things require a *supermajority* of 67 votes. Some require 75! To ratify an amendment to the constitution, 3/4 of state legislatures have to ratify it.

The most important things governing this country aren't done by popular vote, and they often require far more than a majority vote. There's a good reason for it.

For something huge, you need to make sure it's not something that's going to be overturned when a few seats flip in 2/4 years. The vast majority of Puerto Ricans don't want statehood, or at the very least are completely apathetic. That's not a good situation for statehood.
The options aren't yes or no. The options are- 

"Do you want true statehood and equality for Puerto Rico" 

or

"Do you want Puerto Rico to remain a colony under the orders of the US congress?"

Do you see now why everyone but the pro-statehood party boycotted?

>then the only represented population we have voted 97% in favour, that tells me that the people who actually care about the situation enough to vote on it want statehood. Anyone else should be treated as indifferent, which is not necessarily a no vote.

When they normally get 80% turnout and they get 23% for this vote, it tells you all you need to know about how the people feel.
Are there ways that people who don't have extra cash can volunteer short term and make a difference? College kids on spring break, say? 

Perhaps the communities where people tend to build homes, like in the example above, should be asked about the kinds of things they'd like volunteers to do when they visit. I'm sure transporting potable water might help in some areas, or digging wells within communities. Something that would benefit many families and is self sustaining or requires little maintenance. 

I know that's still not answering what these people are then going to do to make money, but at least it may be more helpful than building presumably nicer shelters for people who already have sufficient ones
Oh, I know. In the US, they have boots on the ground. It seems they have connections to Mexico. Puerto Rico is a different question.

The various chapters across the US will even train on immediate disaster relief. 
It always depended on what the teacher was willing to cover. The mo state constitution tests, and the US constitution tests were what was pressed most early on. Had to pass both of them to graduate. I had to take that shit in seventh, and eighth to graduate for a K-8. Then turn around and do them both all over again for high school. Past that I think I had to have one American history, and one World history class. 

My american history teacher was a basically good ol' boy. He used to make fun of one of my friends for listening to Rage Against the Machine. Something along the lines of, "If they don't like it here, and want to protest so much, why don't they just leave?" Things in that class were always a bit skewed, but this was also a small town. World history was a bit better, but still left a lot to be desired. Teacher was pretty cool, though. 

Edit: I did have some really good teachers, and I hope my son gets to be in some of their classes. A lot were just your basic small town centric kind of people, and our sports teams / school pride was more important. 

No they referred to them as the civil rights movement.
"The war of northern aggression"
As a Texan, I don't see the difference. 
Too can be used as a synonym for also. It can also be used to mean something in excess for example too tired.


he went to texas schools, give him a break 
Bingo. I know everything there is to know about wow history and pretty much everything but the ending to ASOIAF... but I can't name more than a few presidents...
My apologies, I should have specified. Taiwan.
More it's the intended result of refocussing education towards standardized tests. Tying moeny to it just heps keep other schools who might object quiet.
I'm not kidding, I think a desire to pin the problems of America on x president or y class of voters is also symptomatic of the same misprioritization going on in education.

People don't care about learning anymore. They don't care about having the correct information, they just care about being right. It used to be cool to be smart, not because it was cool to be smart but because smart people could do a lot of positive things.

Its not like there's an active effort to weed out intelligent people but pop culture does not cater to intelligence, valuable information, or learning.
Its not magic, it's just taught at a young age instead of highschool when the brain has already set it's language pathways. 
Thinking Slovakia, Belarus or Lithuania tbh. Dont see why it would be relevant to learn polish if you're Bulgarian or from the balkans
I think it's not the amount of money but the distribution. Same with healthcare. The US spends more money than the rest of the world on that too but somehow its not benefiting the majority of the population. It's almost as if there was a system in place to keep poor, uneducated people where they are. 
Perhaps you didn't know this, but while America may spend more money on education total, that does not mean that every school and every student gets the same amount of funding and education. Schools are paid from property taxes.

Which means school in a very rich neighborhood will have ridiculous amounts of funding. Enough for state of the art equipment and furnishing it's students with that equipment to take home. Enough for a hot tub for its swim team.

Whereas in a school in a poor neighborhood, students will be lucky if their textbook has all of its pages and was printed less than 7 years before. 

There is a HUGE disparity in education in our schools. And increased funding and a change in how schools are funded is the only way to stop that. Ironically you seem to not be very well educated about the problems of our education.
Went on a trip to Vermont and one guy made a huge deal about our Alabama driver's licenses. "I guess I'll take them, but I know these are fake, I can tell by the feel of the plastic." 
It‚Äôs the name of the landmass containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic. You‚Äôve undoubtedly heard of the two nations and that they share an island, so you‚Äôre good.
[deleted]
Here's something else fun, Trinidad and Tobago are the exact opposite of Haiti and Dominican Republic - one country, two islands. Yay, the Caribbean!
The Caribbean you mean. Central America are (is?) the countries south of Mexico and north of South America.
Wasn't that to do with the US changing a law for them and then investors bailing?
What's more American than defaulting on debt?
Have you ever been to DC? They're not exactly thrilled with having no representation either. 
What about the handful of states that take more than they contribute to the union. Should we conviene an order to withdraw state hood and representation because they are not picking up their fair share of the bill. Being a territory vs a state carries very few benefits as oppose to a state. We are all in this together including our territories. It's a shame our federal government blatantly ignores our territories. Puerto Rico gives the USA vast territorial waters that it otherwise wouldn't have which come with many economic and geopolitical benefits.
I'd say if 77 percent of people didn't show up to the vote, that would indicate a resounding "meh".
Texas?  Isn't that the place with the Big Hats just south of the Moon? (See [Map](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fe/0a/bf/fe0abf00fe39593055461606479b2936.jpg).)
It's kinda more embarrassing for me. I can tell you about Rome from the legends about the start to the fall of the western empire, but can't name more than probably 10 presidents. Even though I KNOW that the rest are kicking around in my head, I just wasn't as interested
Public education in the US has always been an indoctrination assembly line, that schools are modeled on the factory floor should be evidence enough of this.  
Learning a language as a child is more of a superpower than being born already able to fly.
Nearly every single one of my textbooks was over 10 years old, my sociology textbook still mentioned the Soviet Union. I took the class last year. The only new textbook I ever got to use was my AP BIO book, that was only 4 years old.  

This was in a middle class area, but rural small (town of 1,500) schools get neglected pretty badly.
Don't overestimate my knowledge ;) but yes you're correct I know of them
What a wacky broken place!
Not really.  There was an unintended loophole in the original law that banned states from running budget deficets, but didn't specify anything about US territories. 

The law was later revised to include territories within the original constraint, as territories are functionally equivalent to states in this case. 
The thing about D.C. is that it exists so that it could be run directly by the federal government as its seat.  Nobody was actually supposed to live there other than people working for the federal government and elected officials.
Not sure about withdrawing statehood, but it is damn infuriating that their votes count for a lot more than states that contribute a lot more, especially given some of their decisions with regard to financial choices based purely on political association.  Hell, even right now, the bill in the Senate is going to try and strip Federal money from states that accepted the Medicaid expansion and give it to those that did not, on some principle of fairness, when those states rejected he expansion purely to hurt Obamacare and rally their base toward lunacy.
> What about the handful of states that take more than they contribute to the union

And strangely also vote Republican.

The three options were statehood, Independence, or status quo.  From my reading, many boycotters wanted improved territory status, i.e. not statehood and not Independence, but more support from the federal government.
That map is no longer accurate: Austin ain‚Äôt as cool as it used to be. 
I think it's better not to generalize about these things. There have been different movements in the history of education, and education policy has historically been highly contested in the political arena. Recently the right has won some huge battles, maybe the largest being the implementation of standardized testing, where right-wing policy think-tanks generate the tests. It doesn't matter what your curriculum says if you are ultimately judged on what the Frasier institute thinks you ought to know. So students end up being forced to memorize a list of facts, spell certain words, and do certain math equations, _and that's it_. Critical thinking is not required, or philosophy, or any of a multitude of other skills and disciplines that comprise a complete education.
[deleted]
I went to a kinda shitty middle America school, and most of my teachers were pretty open minded and challenging. If you want to see indoctrination in schools, go to any non democratic nation and ask the people what they think of the world.
That's a pretty big thing to suddenly find out. If that happened to the federal government it would be a shit show too. Can't say I blame them honestly. 
How can nestle say the law needs interpretation?  It's freaking lead!
Are they being held to ransom?
compared to what Nestle did with baby formula in Africa, shipping leaded noodles is actually pretty tame.
Stop! Or the Noodles gets it! Multinational corporate blackmail holds gun to head of Democratic process...
Why is there any lead in there?
I thought this was going to be about some chemical they were using was just found out to contain carcinogens or "in high quantities chemical x can cause this reaction" but fucking lead? 
Make a move and the noodles gets it.

"higher-than-allowed levels"

Why is ANY lead allowed?
Brill! Indian taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill for a Multinational company's inability to enforce minimum safe standards in a Law suit.
That is really pretty impressive of them.  Nestle pretty much owns South America.  They have the power to force suppliers to change.
They get major props for this.

Mostly because almost no one knew about the issue and they themselves chose to go through the bullshit to make it right. That makes them awesome.
I hope they keep their promises it sure would be special.
There needs to be a proper ad campaign in the USA to alert the consumers. What mad alchemy it is that one child's utter despair is neatly packaged for another child to eat and think it's everything good about the world. 
as always, i'm PREEETY sceptical if a huge company "suddenly" gets a change of heart an jumps on the consumer bandwagon. they've smelt the money their consumers are willing to throw at them for perceived justice. they forced child slave labour for ages. MAYBE this a genuine win for the consumer, who doesn't want to be part of the blood chocolate trade any more OR this is just yet another marketing scheme because they know that their image is far more important than either the lives of those slaves children or the quality of their products. paired with the idea that consumers are willing to pay way more for fair trade than for regular products, this could mean they either want to get ahead of the ethics game and keep the profits at least at the same level or they just saw a huge opportunity to milk the consumers for even more money. while there always is a gradient between those two extremes i tend to think they rather choose the latter, given the track record of huge mega corps.

Those children are just lazy.  They should get better jobs if they don't like it, save their pennies, and some day buy a child labor factory of their own.
>just like apple and foxconn

And Microsoft, Sony, and pretty much every big electronics brand out there. Most gadgets are produced by Foxconn.
I live in the United States (news may be different where you are) but I can tell you that any issue with Nestle is never spoken of.
Support the war on terror, buy some plastic crap you don't need.
Don't forget the 5000% profit margin. 
It'll be a very long time before the residents of Flint trust their municipal water source.
> ...the levels of lead in Flint‚Äôs water are well below action levels and have been that way for nearly two years.

Two years?  Really?
One quick test would prove this either true or false.

Anybody?
Is there an easy way to test the water at the tap? Some sort of filter that changes color or something that can be installed cheaply? 
I live in Flint and I would just like to request y'all drop a 100 ton nuke smack dab on downtown Flint and just wipe the slate clean.  It's so bad here. 
From the states handout

> Why won‚Äôt anyone in state government come right out and say the water is ‚Äòsafe to drink‚Äô? Is it or isn‚Äôt it?
>> The standard is that the water system must comply with the federal Lead and Copper Rule. Under those guidelines, Flint‚Äôs water system is producing water that meets very high standards ‚Äì even better than other water systems in cities of similar  size across the nation.

Man, dodged the question
Anyone with the means to should move out of Flint. 
Meanwhile, the state just issued a permit to Nestle to extract something like 400,000 gallons/day from a source not too far from Flint. Oh, the hypocrisy. I can't seem to locate a link to the article atm, but its out there.

EDIT: punctuation
People should make a point of serving flint water to politicians at restaurants.  Bottle it and ship it to any restaurant who asks for a bottle.  Save it in the back like a fine wine.  Whenever a politician shows up, pour him a glass, and cook with it, and be sure to tell him and his guest who provided the water for his meal only after he‚Äôs finished enjoying it.  Make this happen every place he goes.  
Daily reminder to read articles before you formulate an opinion. They aren‚Äôt stopping water distribution to be assholes. They‚Äôre stopping because the water levels are back to where they should be. This is a good thing. 
Here is the short version of how flint water went wrong....

Most municipalities in southeast Michigan use the Detroit water and sewer system (dwsd, have changed their name to glwa..but whatever)

Dwsd mismanaged money for decades and has billions of dollars of debt.   Most cities on dwsd water pay crazy high water bills.  Not because water is expensive, quite the opposite, but because they have to service the debt.   Michigan residents pay way more for water than residents of Phoenix.   

The water rates are different for each municipality.   Flint was being charged among the highest rates for water.   The city of flint and it's residents were basically broke.   Flint acted on a brilliant plan, to build their own pipeline from Lake Huron, running parallel to the dwsd pipeline.   They joined some other municipalities to build the Kwa line which promised to save flint residents tons of money on their water bill.   

Dwsd was pissed!   They are a monopoly and were incensed at the idea.   So they ended flints water contract.    They gave the option to pay like an extra $12m annually, but flint could not afford this, and dwsd knew it.  

Everything should be fine, right?  Flint can just use their new pileline.....except it hadn't been built yet.   It takes at least 2 years to build a 50 mile pipeline and all the associated infrastructure.   

And by this time, flint is so close to insolvency that the state was forced to step in with an "emergency manager" appointed by the govenor to hopefully keep flint from entering bankruptcy.  Flint was broke because the automakers mostly moved away, and the level of corruption in the city could no longer be funded appropriately. 

So flint is getting their water shutoff by dwsd 2 years before the pipeline will be finished.   This is ok though, because flint has a backup water source.   Flint used to provide all their own water (50 years ago?) and even after connecting to dwsd flint kept all their old equipment hooked up and tested it on occasion.   The decision was made to switch the city over to this system which uses the flint river as its source.  

The water plant employees were apparently not educated or competent enough to know that some really inexpensive chemical needed to be added to the water to keep this buildup of "protective coating" on the inside of all the old pipes, especially the ones made of lead.   Once the new water began to wear away the protective coating, lead began to leach from the pipes into the water.   At this point, the state agency overseeing the water plant should have fixed the error.    If the city and state employees were incompetent, at least the Federal agency in charge would notice that these chemicals were not being added and take corrective action.   That didn't happen either.   

There are some unknown quantity of lead water mains, lead service lines from the mains to the houses, and many houses with lead pipes.  They have been diligently replacing these lead lines, but it's a big city with poor records of what kind of pipes are where.   

That's how the crisis began.  
Forget trust. Has an independent body tested the lead levels in the water themselves? This shouldn't be hard to verify.
We can unilaterally fight in multiple wars for decades but clean water?  Get the fuck out of here hippie.
So, does anybody actually know what the deal is? Is Snyder talking out of his ass again saying that the water is safe now? Or are the people of Flint just being whiny babies? Last I heard next to nothing had been done to fix things.
[removed]
Flint town native here. Yeah, it sucks. Luckily i have well water & whole house purification. I feel bad for those who have to use and ingest this poison 
i hope this means everyone is getting fresh, non-lethal water through the pipes now.
Can someone please explain to me why drinking water is not purified of lead before going out of the treatment plants or is the lead being introduced by sub standard piping that leeches lead into the water? 
. . . because the water there is fine now. Honest!
It says that they're ending it because the lead levels dropped, but what about all the other problems the water had?  Old pipes fostering legionnaire's disease, the corrosive elements...?  Were those problems fixed?
but....aren't the pipes still bad? Don't they still need water?
Was anyone jailed for this? Or is it all " ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø " not our fault?
Awesome that means everything is fixed now! Good job gubmint!
I wonder what the adoption rate for locally sourced water will be though.
Why has the governor not been convicted and jailed?
Mission Accomplished?? 
That doesn‚Äôt sound right.  Don‚Äôt people pay a water bill at home? 
So the way this is worded seems like ‚ÄúWe need to be outraged that the government is not helping these poor people‚Äù while it should be more of a ‚ÄúWe need to celebrate that the issue affecting these poor people has been fixed and they can return to normal lives.‚Äù
Conservatives are cancer. 
I hated Flint,  so happy we shut down operations there years ago. 
This isn't a story anymore, they've had clean water forever.

VICE News first reported that over a year ago - and they aren't really known for their alt-right bias... (For those who don't know, they're extremely liberal)

If I see anymore stupid "It's been x days since Flint has had clean water" tweets I might lose my mind.

Puerto Rico is in real trouble still - tweet about this if you want a cause.  If you tweet about Flint you might as well be tweeting #NoDAPL...
Why are people still living in Michigan?  
My ex is an environmental engineer.  

Only the foolhardy would think this is a cash cow waiting to happen.  Oh no, this is lawsuit upon lawsuit upon lawsuit for ANY company who dares even try to fix this hot mess.  

More power to anyone who tries.
Nestle gets water from Michigan for nothing! 
I‚Äôm going to assume you two are the same person. But when you switch usernames you change silly hats and diabolically switch the mouse to the other mangled paw. I also assume you owe $3.96 in late fees at the local library. And I assume you were early to jump on the US Men‚Äôs curling bandwagon in hopes you would seem cool when they won gold. 
Is that how this works?
Hell, it‚Äôll be even longer until they trust their city again. There is a great Netflix series that followed the police for a couple years and showed how they and the people were thoroughly fucked several times over. 
Am in flint refuse to trust water after the initial lies of it being safe 
They literally publish the results of tests online, it's far from a crisis
Yup. What‚Äôs crazier, Flint was neither the only one nor the worst when it came to water conditions. Hundreds and hundreds of counties around the US had problems similar to Flint‚Äôs and many of them worse. 
Yeah, that's the water leaving the water treatment facility, not leaving the tap. The problem now for the past few years has been the pipes leading up to the homes, which are still made of lead and lack a protective coating. The only reliable way to fix that is digging up and replacing the pipes in each house's front yard, which means time and money. 
The problem is that the water at the source might be clean, but the municipal water is still in the lines, and still corroded the lead pipes used to deliver it. 
You would have to do more than one test. Maybe you test the water in one house and find out it is fine. But then you do another test for a house a few blocks away and that water is not fine, because it uses different pipes. Pipe systems are complicated. You can test clean in one place on one day and then not clean in the same place on the next day.

The state government claims they've tested the water adequately but the people of Flint don't trust government when they say water is safe to drink.
The result of every water test is literally published online. It's far far far from a crisis...

took me 2 seconds, that'll be 0.01 cents
Sorry that you‚Äôre stuck in this situation. Can you elaborate on what‚Äôs going on there now?
if you're gonna go to the trouble of doing that, might as well drop it somewhere else instead
Nah, that's obvious.  It's because it isn't the DEQs job to say if it's safe or not, just what the numbers are and whether they're within guidelines. Going beyond that at all invites legal action.
I'm pretty sure no one lives in the [4th most dangerous city in the United States](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https%3A//www.forbes.com/pictures/efel45mde/4-flint-mich/&refURL=&referrer=) because they want to.
They already have.
[Here's a link](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/nestles-bid-pump-water-michigan-approved-despite-major-public-outcry/)
I don't understand the connection here. 

Flint's issue was the piping infrastructure under the city leeching lead, not a lack of water to pump. Michigan is literally surrounded by the largest source of fresh water on the planet and it regularly falls from the sky, there is no shortage whatsoever for any municipal pumping authorities...

Can you elaborate on your thought process here? In what way do you think that Nestle facility is negatively impacting Flint?
What's so bad about that? The problem isn't a lack of source water, in fact there's a distinct *abundance* of that in Michigan. The problem is just that the water wasn't appropriately treated before entering Flint's water system, so it corroded the piping.

It has no relevance to anything Nestl√® are doing in the area.
I'm getting PTSD to back when Nestle said access to drinking water shouldn't be human right.
Honestly, they kind of need the revenue to fix the piping problems. 
What's the hypocrisy here? Maybe I'm dumb. Can you spell it out for me?
There's plenty of reasons to hate Nestle, but this shit (bitching about what, in the scheme of things, is minuscule amounts of water) is ridiculous. 
I don't understand the correlation between nestle and flint.  

Flint had (has) bad municipal water because of a failure of government at every level.   

Nestle got a permit approved that allows them to pump water out of a well they already own.  Nestle dug the well, built all the infrastructure, pays for the electricity, pays taxes, employs people, and jumped through all the necessary hoops to get a permit that allows them increase the rate of water they pump up to 6.6 gallons per second.  

Lake Huron looses water down the Detroit river at an average of 1.2 million gallons per second.   What nestle does is not even a drop in the bucket.   (Nestle doesn't draw water directly from the lakes but the water systems are related)



Michigan is among the best, most logical place to build a water bottling plant in the USA.  

Nestle also purchases lots of municipal water from Evart.  
Everyone outside of Michigan has no say in this. This Nestle stuff is BS. Legionaires disease in flint too? Bankrupt Detroit barely sending water to its consumers? But a private company can profit?
>Meanwhile, the state just issued a permit to Nestle to extract something like 400,000 gallons/day from a source not too far from Flint.

There couldn't be some sort of correlation there right? They stopped handing out bottled water at the same time the deal went through? Analogous to a non-compete clause I mean.
Snyder 'tried it'.
Snyder 'tried it'.
It would be a good thing under the right circumstances. I‚Äôm not sure the circumstances are there yet. The corroding lead pipes that helped cause the problem in the first place are still there. Also, who did the testing of those water levels and how do we know we can trust them? This one article alone won‚Äôt put me on the governor‚Äôs side. But if there was more information for me to look into, I could *maybe* be persuaded. 
I live in Flint and I can tell you nobody is going to be to be drinking that water. We've been heavily dependant on the distribution sites. This is going to be very bad.
The water levels are normal now but the pipes that supply water to the homes are still full of lead and contaminates. This is a bad thing.
The water in many homes is still not safe to drink...
if it's still leaded, we'll probably hear about it soon.  

easy news story.  
It's both. Regulations dictate water is tested at the source and also at a set number of random houses/buildings. Tests point to the water being healthy.

Some people are just being whiny and stubborn. Some are just skeptical because it's been a long process and after going without safe city water for so long it leads one to be skeptical. A lot of the complaints are surrounding the fact that the city/state/nation won't pay to replace house pipes. Since they are privately owned pipes (owned by the home owner), it makes sense that the responsibility would be on the home owner. It's a pretty expensive process though, so a lot of people can't afford it. One argument is that since the city fucked up in the first place, they should have to pay for private pipes to be replaced/repaired.

Millions have been poured into fixing things. It's just a super heated situation with a ton of pissed off people.
sure, if everyone had the money to do so
Oh geez :( do you guys have water stores? I have one near me. The store has its own filtration system and sells it for like 25cents a gallon. 

Flints situation is a Fucking disgrace on the part of both the corporations and government. I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually became abandoned.
The lead piping leading to houses is corroding into the water because they switched to a more acidic source
They switched to a water source with a higher PH level and didn't appropriately treat the water before it entered Flint's system, because they didn't consider the problem. As a result, the water gradually corroded the minerals coating the piping that prevented lead from leeching into the water, so (AFAIK) they've been putting those minerals in the water in order to recoat the piping, which took a while. And the water is treated to an appropriate PH level, now.

I don't know enough about the situation to tell you whether the piping can be considered "sub-standard", but it seems that there's nothing wrong with the pipe system, it's just that when they switched to the new water source no one thought "hey, this new water might corrode the pipes".
Substandard piping, which is why the state can say the water has been tested and is acceptable, but the city is begging not to have the bottled water supply stopped.
The results are literally public and can be found online sooooo...
Ah, yeah, sure, don't worry about it. It's fine this time. Really. 
You need another \\ in there to make it work.
it was a government wide effort. as much as it sucks. there's no one person to blame. 
There have been a few people who have been charged, but I don't think anyone actually was sentenced to jail time.  
Flint has been a democratic run city for the greater part of the last century... how are conservatives to be blamed for this?
Yes, this never would have happened if it wasn't for conservatives. They are the only corrupt group of people who have ever existed. Before them no politician ever fucked people over.
Yep, Conservatives ruined flint
The liberal city council and mayor (who are corrupt) did not make this decision. It was the emergency manager and ultimately the conservative governor decision. Weaver wasn't even in office when this went down! The mayor and city council are shit but not to blame for the water crisis. 
shitty people are shitty people, regardless of party affiliation.
West side of the state is great. Detroit is really getting better, the neighborhoods are still rough though. If the suburbs could get their shit together that‚Äôd help tremendously with the metro area as a whole.

With that being said, my ass is moving as soon as I pay off student debt. Any good suggestions for a finance degree that isn‚Äôt New York or Charlotte?
I would never move....the majority end up coming back anyways.
I would never move....the majority end up coming back anyways.
Everybody gets water from Michigan for nothing as long as they pay for the well.  Nestle isn't special in that regard.
The fuck does this mean?
Flint Town, great series. Not only were the citizens fucked over, but the police by the city council who defunded them repeatedly. 
I'm surprised Flint isn't a ghost town at this point.
Can we talk about the girl who wanted to be a Detective and only reason she stayed with her cop boyfriend was she didn't lose her job
Stranger things?
You can buy water testing kits for cheap on Amazon.  
Also in Flint, just got an apartment by Court and Beecher (which came standard with a Brita water filter). Sup yo!
I don't blame you.. hope changes are being made.
It's almost as if test results can just be faked. And there have been dozens of cases of fudged or outright falsified reports before.
But only one was mostly minority residents so that one was the national story
I‚Äôm in Philadelphia and when the water company is replacing mains in the street and comes across a lead line, they replace it for free. Philadelphia is under 10% lead services and we are pushing for total eradication of lead service lines. 
I live in Flint and I just want to point out that. They are (very slowly) replacing pipes, from the road up a few feet into your yard. That still leaves pipe all the way up into your house and inside your house, of pretty much everyone's house that all got tainted by the original fuck up of chemical levels ruining pipes. 


They're doing jack shit to what needs to be fixed.

Flint is very poor. I see people saying there are worse cases out there. Maybe. I'm not sure. But I do know that our problem is not fixed. And probably never will be. 


Actually they test at the tap, passing requires 90th percentile passage from random homes and high risk homes. They test preflush and postflush as well (if I remember right).
Is the pipes in the yard not the home owner responsibility?
Water doesn't sit for long periods of time in the system.

As for the pipes, they've been adding minerals to recoat the lead piping.

As for the source water, it was never unsafe. It had a higher PH level that dissolved the minerals that coated the insides of the lead piping. 

The screwup was in not treating the water from the new source to adjust the PH level.

That doesn't necessarily mean the water is safe. It's just a rebuttal to your points.


They have tested the water at hundreds of homes, that is what federal standards require.  The results of state testing have been confirmed by federal and independent testing. 
Lead pipes were rarely used (since Roman times). Steel or cast iron pipes with leaded joints is probably far more accurate.

Additionally, the insurance companies carrying municipalities *ORDERED* the municipalities (across the entire United States) to quit using gas chlorine (and all the process that requires) or they would drop the insurance policies to the cities.

The insurance companies made municipalities change over to a process of of water sanitizing called "chloramine reduction", which amounts to the water supplier dumping hydrogen peroxide into the water along with a solid chlorine. 




This process is a poor sanitizer (for water, drinking especially) as it allows certain 'critters' to make it through the sterilization process. No one figures the slime, molds and algae it doesn't kill won't hurt you  (jury is out on that one too - too bad the EPA just got shut down).

The bad part about changing the method of sanitization...

The old way, with chlorine gas, chlorine has a pH of about 2 - VERY acidic. So what the water plants would do is add soda ash to jack the pH back up into the 8-9 range with an eye towards 8.0 

What this would do would cause "scaling" inside the pipes. The scaling would actually seal in the lead in the joints of the pipes after a few years and so lead would gradually quit being a problem. Well the new process doesn't change the pH much so they no longer ad soda ash (a higher pH doesn't dissolve the pipes as badly, either), and because they no longer add soda ash, all that scaling is slowly being eroded and exposing the lead again.

This is happening all across the United States. This, and utilities, and *infrastructure* should be a big part of this country's priorities right now... none of them are. 


They mentioned if a resident thought their water was still contaminated that there were options for testing. Also there was a very brief mention of filters still being passed out. A resident of Flint commented that the pipes in the house are the problem but unfortunately I don't see the city doing anything about that. Its like if a pipe is clogged, city lines will be taken care of by the city for free, but clogs in your pipes are your own problem. 
Testing for lead in the water, even widespread like that, isn't that hard to do. And if a central lab is set up where lots of different locations can bring in samples, then the whole process gets that much faster AND cheaper. You can run a lab test for lead in the water 200 times a day for cheaper than you can do 10. 

then all you have to do is get the community involved - that shouldn't be too hard considering we're talking about their water.

You start testing and logging accurate results you'll be ready to either rest easy or call bullshit on the water suppliers.

And yeah, I understand exactly how "the pipes" work, and if there's lead in a pipe that's being borne in the water then that's the supplier's fault. If it's in the piping in certain parts of the city, that the city's fault, and if it's in your house then you'd best figure out a way to replumb your house.
\#1 don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúthe government ‚Äú.  Left or Right I think that lessen has been learned.  What I can add is that lived in a home in NW Indiana that had a lead service line leading into the house.   From a practical point I was less concerned with that pipe than the 50 year old corroded galvanized pipe inside the house.  Lead is non-corrosive.  But chemistry being what it is you can pull Pb ions depending on the pH of the water.  Once the pH is under control the immediate problem is solved.  That does not remove the emotional pain of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù.
1/100th of a cent?

I don't know what you mean
But if it was safe then there could be no legal action...
I live in Flint and honestly I can't imagine what it's like out there. it seems fake when I travel to nice places.

Yeah if Flint wasn‚Äôt a dead town with no budget, they may not be in this mess.
Here's another [one](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/03/599207550/michigan-oks-nestl-water-extraction-despite-over-80k-public-comments-against-it).

Fuck whoever OK'd this shit. I don't even live in the same timezone , and this makes me LIVID. 
The same agency to lie about Flint and their lead levels...goes on to allow a private company to suck 33% more perfectly clean water from the same state...and you see no connection of why people may be upset?
> Michigan is literally surrounded by the largest source of fresh water on the planet

I didn't know Michigan was in Russia!
The whole problem started anyways because Flint‚Äôs water source was switched to an inferior alternative that wasn‚Äôt properly treated.

They're not paying a fair amount. Nestle wants our water for dirt cheap.
And people need to learn about context and understanding where he was speaking and what he was talking about and what problem he was proposing the solution for.
Probably because you didn't take the time to learn about the context of the statement
What revenue?
The interview isn't even in English, so we have to read English subtitles, which we assume to be correct.  

Nestle guy was basically saying that people don't necessarily have a right to clean, filtered, processed water delivered to their home for free, but that if people cannot afford it society should build systems that provide water to everybody.   

He also thinks that water (clean, filtered, delivered) should have value and be treated like any other food stuff partly because if something has no value, people tend to waste lots of it...whereas if something is valuable, people tend to use it more judiciously.  
Nestle already had water rights. They requested to pull out more, which was approved. 
A 5 gallon bucket is about 400'000 standard 1/20 ml drops. So what Nestle is taking is about two drops in the bucket.
[deleted]
You keep spouting this rhetoric off in random comments on here but I haven't seen you post a single real rebuttal to back up your belief.
Exactly. The pipes aren't close to being fixed. It will take years to resolve that. 
Don't forget lead contamination was just one of the issues their water had.
So you know something more than the state? Because [this](http://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/0,6092,7-345-76292_76294_76297---,00.html) link shows ten houses with high lead levels.
Let us know when YOU are persuaded.  Yours is the opinion we‚Äôre all waiting for.
What would it take for Flint residents to drink the local water supply again?
Its not so much whining as fear. If you go back to when thos whole thing started, the cover-up first began, MDEQ violated testing guidelines in order to make the water appear safer than it really was. Most people are just afraid that the same thing is happening again, and cant trust the state to say the water is safe now, when it has been tested the exact same way it was (supposed to be) tested way back in the beginning of all this.
No. They were told EXACTLY what would happen of they didnt use anti corrosive agents. They were told in initial testing that Flint River water was 19x more acidic than the water that was being treated by Detroit. There were many, many, many emails sent back and forth between MDEQ and Flint authorities, and if I recall correctly the EPA regional office regarding the need for anti corrosives and the fact that Flint was not using them. It would have cost $100 a day to treat the water properly and the residents just weren't worth that much to the administration.
Yeah because it's not like they had multiple felony indictments for lying on public records or anything.
I trust the system that originally caused this problem entirely.
The joke is it's not supposed to work, just like the piping

Or the people who live there

Or their newly mentally handicapped children
That is a lie. Too big to jail.
Never trust a politician to actually abide by the letter that follows their name.

Or, more succinctly: never trust a politician.

Democrats can absolutely have conservative leanings (and vise versa), especially when some lobbyist plops a shitload of money in front of them.
[removed]
It's more accurate to say that Detroit ruined Flint.
Read the article dumbfuck. The GOP did this shit. It's literally in the god damn article. 


The emergency manager was a democrat as well...

You people try hard as hell to avoid criticizing them and going REEEEEE Republicans!
Username checks out
Yeah, it was kinda sad to watch that series. Especially when the first episode they boot the old police chief out and the people who were against it in the city hall ended up being exactly the same people who took the money out of the police budget and left them with less money then they had before.
The episode after the police successfully convince the public to vote to give them emergency funding is heart breaking.  They spend so much time convincing citizens that *this time*, the money will actually go to the police and not get taken by corrupt city government.  Then the city fucks them over after they win the emergency funding vote.
I am watching this series.

Pissed me right off when mayor did what she did with police commissioner. Poor man stepped up when no one else would. Did a job no one else would do... Mayor bent him over and tail-ended that guy.
Trust me, I'm sure a lot of people in Flint want to move, too. Poverty does a hell of a good job keeping people right where they are
What a world we live in.
At this point, if i lived in flint, if learn how to distill water. 
I work with a company who manufactures mail order lab kits for lead in water and I attempted to get them to donate 50k of kits for FEMA in Puerto Rico.
Isn't Court and Beecher Flint Township? Seems like that would be Detroit water. I know the border is right along there. 
Do Brita filters actually get the lead out?

Source on them faking the flint water tests results?
Then wtf do you want, by your standards the crisis will literally never be over. Fuck facts I want to be outraged!
Or it might have to do with the population being nearly 100,000 people including over 400,000 in the metropolitan area.

Unless of course these other cities aren't small. 

Edit: City of Flint Population ~100k

Flint Metropolitan Area (also known as Mid Michigan ~400k)
People died because of that water. It may be better now but dont pretend like others are on here that it wasnt really really bad.

But the horror!  Our nation's morality has been irreparably damaged by someone in Philadelphia having their pipes replaced for free!  We'll never be a great nation if people didn't suffer from failing their homeowner responsibilities!

I never agreed that my tax money would result in someone living a life free from lead.  This is outrageous!
Hey, I‚Äôd love for someone else to fix my pipes.  But that‚Äôs not how it works with home ownership.  Gotta fix your own pipes.
Homeowners own the laterals and the rest.  That‚Äôs your responsibility.  

Denver has the same problem.  Some houses have lead laterals, and these things were installed in the 40s.    There‚Äôs really just a handful of neighborhoods.  And so Denver puts a fuckload of orthophosphate in their water.

That stuff is a nightmare for the rest of us. It clogs pipes and fixtures.  I have to replace my kitchen faucet every three years.  That‚Äôs a lifetime warranty Moen faucet, like $200.  Someday I‚Äôll have to gut my house because it‚Äôs filling my pipes and they will be solid crap with no channels for water.  

These cities need to fix the fucking problem not pass it on to the millions of other people who maintain their house.  Condemn those things if the owners don‚Äôt fix their pipes.  There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to have lead pipes in 2018.
Flint thrives in the loser role.   No one works, no one pays taxes.   No handout is ever enough and it's still the same boring 'they TOOK er JOBS!!' narrative 2 generations past the time of the auto industry mattering in the area.   

Source: am from Flintish 
Where I‚Äôm at the responsibility starts at the ferrule tap into the main all the way out in the street. Average cost for a full replacement to the meter is about 4500 soup to nuts 
You're right on all counts here.  Unfortunately, the mineral buildup that protects lead from leaching out of the pipes will take years to rebuild.

Source: my wife is a municipal water chemist in the area.
Wouldn't it make more sense to rebut his points if you had any indication the measure you mention actually works?
It was also never the municipal pipes that were the problem. It was the home pipes. 
> Water doesn't sit for long periods of time in the system.

Technically not entirely true. It completely depends on the dynamics of the water system. I've seen systems where the level of use near a tower are so low that the water just sloshes back and forth. This increases the water age in that general area of the system and thus the water quality is worse off. 

Doesn't always happen but it can. 
Well, glad to hear the water is back on par then. In one place I lived, we had high levels of Arsenic in the water. In another it was pharmaceuticals. Then in another area, the water district pulled from the Animas river which was polluted after an EPA disaster near a Colorado Mine. Suffice it to say, I am wary of drinking water from the tap.

But then again, I am also wary of drinking Arrowhead water, which is simply groundwater, and now we head that Nestle uses well water.
Very interesting information, thank you.

Traveling outside of Michigan feels weird to me. Even some of the nice communities inside the state too. A Michigander for better or worse.

You can read my other comments explaining how bottling plant usage is a complete non factor to the health of the state's water table levels. So yes, I am incapable of throwing a conniption over it.

I didn‚Äôt know the Arctic and Pacific oceans were fresh water!

Water is effectively worthless in Michigan because it's so incredibly abundant. People all over the state have well systems and pay literally $0 a gallon to pump it. My own parents have a well system and pay nothing for their water. What they do pay for is the equipment and electricity to pump it.

The true cost of water in a place like Michigan is the cost of operating pumping systems to draw and treat it. This is what people are paying for when they use municipal water. But in Nestle's case they built and run their own pumping and treatment system, so there is quite literally no cost the state is realizing by them drawing water.

The really bizarre thing about getting upset is that Nestle is not even the biggest pumper, they're 23rd in the state. Pfizer uses billions of gallons of more for the same price running their pharmaceutical manufacturing, where is the vendetta against them?
It sounds like you're fine with big corps doing what they want..with our water. Just because we have a good water source doesn't mean we should allow all these companies to pump all they want.

Michigan has wells yes..plenty of cities here also don't have wells. If you understood anything about Flint and Saginaw rivers, then you'd understand why the majority of people hate this. Everyone wants OUR water..sick of it.
Just checked again, as a refresher. He says that considering water a human right is extreme. He thinks water should have a market value and steps should be taken to get it to people who have no access to it. So I take that as him saying let the free market figure it out, cause the free market is great at taking care of poor people.
So you shouldn't get a water bill? Water gets plumbed to your house and you use as much as you want and not have to pay a dime?
Which is great, given that Michigan's not going to be shipping that water to their citizens...
I mean Michigan is a riparian right state, not a prior appropriation state like out west. So its pretty easy for Nestle to get the water they need.
Edited for clarity. 
I am a resident and I am not worried about it.  
What is the benefit to the State of Michigan and any of its people?
Do tell.
I think their sentiments reflect those of a lot of us.
? His opinion is pretty reasonable, it would be insane for someone to just blindly trust that the pipes are fine now without more information when they were lied to about it for years. 
That really is disgusting the way they have destroyed a whole city that was already ravaged by high unemployment because of the automobile manufacturing downturn and the GFC. Let's kick them in the guts again while they are already on the ground mentality
The lab publishes the results
what? Who would you blame???
Mayors was a Democrat, in a town dominated by Democrats.... clearly the GOPs fault
I read the article and the mayor is the democrat Karen weaver you dumbfuck/cancer to our society.
You people?

I just said the city council and the current mayor are corrupt...and they are Democrats! 

Ultimately, Snyder is to blame. He's the boss. And also a tool. 
Didn't the Nestle deal go through yesterday or the day before? And they're stopping distribution of bottled water now? That timing... Is it hard to test for led yourself btw does anyone knows?
Very depressing and spreading to other cities. Make America Great Again is a big fucking fairy tale.
Every police officer in Flint should have walked off the job after that.
It's even more heart breaking that the predominant race in Flint is represented quite well by their local  politicians, and they still aren't getting the necessary funds.

Imagine the outrage of racism that would be occurring if Flint were represented by white politicians making the exact same decisions as shown in the series...
To be fair though, he really didn't do that good of a job, considering the statistics of crime rates were so high. He took a job which no one else wanted, and did a lousy job of it. 

New guy takes over, and crime rates go down, response time goes up. But then the city council fucks the police over and they realize they can't win, morale likely goes down, and the crime rate went back up (stats verifiable at series end).
I'm not sure why you're being facetious.  It's just a good thing to test the water from your tap at a  new residence.  In Boston's Back Bay the water was always containing gross stuff.
Because of course we are going to trust the *corporations* since our democratic system of government was bought out by ... ummm ... *corporations*.

*You can buy a test kit from your local home center or online. The kits usually come with a package of strips that contain reactants that change color to indicate the presence of various contaminants in your water.  
But beware: the kits are not terribly accurate, and they don't test for all harmful contaminants. If there are very high levels of certain contaminants in your water, the kit very well may flag the problem. But don't expect high accuracy or a guarantee that your water is safe.  
The best bet if you are concerned about the quality of your water: Find a reputable, independent lab, which will provide accurate results and have no vested interest in selling you an expensive filtration system.*

>Do Brita filters actually get the lead out?

Naw you gotta listen to the classic rock radio station at 6 p.m. weekdays for that.

But it depends, the standard brita filters are activated charcoal which only remove organic stuff like bacteria and pesticides, or petro chemicals. But brita does make filters that claim to remove 99% of lead. They don't say what kind of filter it is, but usually only reverse osmosis or distillation is how to remove dissolved metals, which don't fit in portable pitcher or faucet attachments. 
Yes, lead is listed under heavy metals on the back of the box.
Thanks im working on it!
moving is expensive. maybe they found work there.
Type "flint water tests faked" into Google for a bunch of sources.  Many officials have been charged criminally for manipulating the tests.
http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/11/documents_show_city_filed_fals.html and many more. Take 5 seconds to google it if you want more.
So you are saying whatever they tell you, it's factual no matter what? Even when [this](https://www-m.cnn.com/2016/01/14/us/flint-water-investigation/index.html?rm=1) and [this](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/11/documents_show_city_filed_fals.html) has already occurred? I guess we just blindly allow the authorities to form reality around us.
The start of the crisis included officials lying about how samples were taken and faked results. There's nothing that the same organization can do to regain trust. If they want trust they have to fire everybody and start over, because if they cared about safety they wouldn't have lied in the first place. 
Could also be due to the fact that the issue was created in an effort to save money and not properly vet the new solution to again save money.  
Can also add the magnifying effect of a multi award winning documentarian and political activist who is born and raised in the area who is an absolute leftist and revered in the media sphere. Michael Moore.

You're not being funny, clever, smart, or insightful with this comment. It's just annoying.
You're absolutely right. And that's why over half the houses in Flint are now vacant. They couldn't afford to fix someone else's mistake. 
The problem with this is that it is directly the fault of someone else that their pipes are fucked up in the first place...
Who's responsible for the damage in the first place though?  Surely not the homeowner...
Or just pay collectively to fix the fucking pipes.
Ive met a lot of people in Flint through my job. Most the people I've met are decent people trying their best to survive. 
Flint has thrived on the auto industry for probably 100 years. There is nothing else here. So you suddenly have hundreds of thousands of people without jobs. You can pretend like they're just being stupid or entitled. But I think you're an asshole. 

Jesus Christ your comment history. I can't believe I took the time to reply to you. If you truly are from Flint, shame on you. You're no better than those you condemn.
Can you break that down into Schrute Bucks and Stanley Nickels for me?
Is the statement that it's been "safe for two years" a lie then?
Testing water at the tap is the only way to prove things either way.

I was simply pointing out that his points couldn't be used to show that the water *isn't* safe.

Nothing more and nothing less.
Indeed.  The only way to know if it worked is to test the water at a whole bunch of homes in the area.
Your comment is demonstrably false. It was the city pipes leaching lead. And the city (eventually) responded by replacing several lead mains.

this is a solid comment that unfortunately isnt in style so will probably get burried. I hope not because its the truth. pretty much anybody in that area of the world can pump infinite amounts of water for free. farmers do it, rural residents do it. theres no shortages
Just because Michigan has a lot...doesn't mean it goes for free.

His original quote in some more context:

> ‚ÄúWater is, of course, the most important raw material we have today in the world. It‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value. Personally, I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff a value so that we‚Äôre all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there.‚Äù

His later clarification on his statements:

> From time to time on the internet a video clip from a TV programme made in 2005 about food is posted in which I am talking about whether water is a human right. It seems it has surfaced again, and people are using it to misrepresent my views on this important issue.

> Let me be very clear about this again here on the blog, because I think the video clip, which took my views out of context, isn‚Äôt clear about the point I was trying to make. The water you need for survival is a human right, and must be made available to everyone, wherever they are, even if they cannot afford to pay for it. 

> However I do also believe that water has a value. People using the water piped into their home to irrigate their lawn, or wash their car, should bear the cost of the infrastructure needed to supply it. 

So his statement was that whatever water you need to live is a human right. But whatever beyond that should go at a market value. So even your assessment is incorrect in terms of his position.
Poor people are also great at being lazy and not contributing to society. It‚Äôs funny how people always overlook this when they throw around sob stories. 
> Water gets plumbed to your house and you use as much as you want and not have to pay a dime?

That's how it works in Michigan if you have a well. You pay for the well, you pay for the equipment to pump it, and you pump as much as you want for free. Water bills pay for the infrastructure and the pumping.

All democrat city council... repubs fault clearly. 
You can [call your municipal water supply and ask for the consumer confidence report](https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/21/health/lead-testing-home-drinking-water/index.html), but if you don't trust them then that's not a good option.

Not hard to test, it basically is some little strips that you dip in a glass of water, and the color that it shows on the strip can be matched to a level. Typical eztests, like the strips you can get for an aquarium

All before the crisis, you think with national scrutiny they would fake any of the results? The cat is out of the bag they have literally nothing to gain by faking and the entire world is watching.
I guess because you don't trust them the crisis will literally never end
Then when tf will you people be happy
Court cases and investigators have been concluding that their failure to implement the needed neutralizing agents to their water to maintain pipe integrity was more the result of incompetency than any concious cost saving measure. 
How so?  100k people live within the city limits of Flint, while an additional 400k live in the surrounding areas.
Let‚Äôs say the water utility fixes those pipes.  That money comes out of the water ratepayer‚Äôs pockets.  Now, the non-homeowners in Flint have just helped pay to fix the houses.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch here.  Or were you hoping to use Michigan state tax revenue?  Or maybe even federal taxes?  At the end of the day somebody has to pay, and no one here has deep pockets.
Sure, but are those pipes owned by the water utility or by the homeowner? If they're owned by the homeowner, then he takes responsibility for it like anything else in the home he bought.
Homeowners are responsible for all kinds of things that aren‚Äôt their fault.  In my city, we are responsible for upgrading our clay sewer lines from the street.  That‚Äôs an $8k job, straight out of our pocket.  We are responsible for upgrading galvanized steel water lines to copper, when they rust and stop water from flowing at all in our house.  That‚Äôs at least another $8k, maybe more.  We are responsible for upgrading our knob and tube electrical wiring so our houses won‚Äôt burn down when used with modern appliances.  That can be $10k for a whole house.  It‚Äôs not my fault that construction standards were different 80 years ago, but it is my responsibility.  If you don‚Äôt own a house, it may be difficult to understand how many costs are borne by homeowners just as a matter of course.

If you have any equity in your home at all, you can get a bank loan for this stuff.  Bad piping is not why the houses in Flint are empty, but the economic depression that resulted in the empty houses may be a cause of the incompetence of their water agency.
I‚Äôm talking about the lateral line.  The portion between the house and the city‚Äôs line under the streets.  That is the responsibility of the homeowner in nearly all places.

I my city I own the sewer and water pipes right up to the main line.  I own the part that‚Äôs under the street, and I own the connection.  My neighbors sewer line broke loose in the street and he had to have it all replaced.  City doesn‚Äôt own or maintain any of that.

Peak auto industry around 85 

No one under 40 should have expected to work in the auto industry.  It was already done.

Flint will be asking for reparations 50 years from now because 'Buick City just closed'

Also, you're meeting the 10 people in the city who do work.   Go up to Pierson and Pasadena and tell me more than 2/10 homes has someone with a 9 to 5.  The entire culture is 'how to get by entirely on assistance'.   

As far as my post history:  wow, Trump.  Next?
different organizations might have different limits on what constitutes "safe".
What levels they get depend on where they measure it.  It may measure as "safe" right out of the plant, but have leached out dangerous levels of lead by the time it gets to your faucet.

You'd be shocked how little care is taken of the parts of the water system that are underground (and that applies everywhere, not just in Flint).  These pipes are in some places a hundred years old and as long as they haven't obviously burst, they're left alone.
Interesting how you got that edit in after my comment but before the 3 minute mark. reddit has been a bit weird lately, I had a couple comments with broken permalinks the other day.
They've repeatedly tested the water in homes with lead service lines.

They will continue to provide filters for those who want them.
They also have a super high cost of living. I'm on the east side of the mountains and the difference in rent is astronomical.
For those that don't know Lake Baikal in Russia is the largest fresh water source in the world, the size of all five of the great lakes combined. It alone is roughly 20% of the worlds fresh water.
~~I didn't know Lake Baikal was multiple lakes that aggregate to larger than the great lakes~~

Edit: Was wrong
Nope, that's pretty much exactly how the real world works. Supply vs demand. The demand in the area is effectively limitless due to the water cycle continually dropping trillions of gallons of more water into the area via weather. 
Sure..Let a foreign based company make profit off a necessity needed to live. A natural resource located within our country is shipped in trucks from Michigan to your state, and another country profits? Now that is just dumb. They're an unethical company who would easily push to privatize water given the chance.

They'll just leave waste in their path and Michigan will clean it up...yeah... thanks.
Jokes on them I guess? My county is only 45 mins from Flint, and we get ours from the lake. I wouldn't drink from either river.
All I see is the CEO or whoever said that, (who makes billions off of selling water) saying that water shouldn't be free and for someone to say that every human has the right to water is "too extreme"

Then when called out for it over the years-- comes up with a giant backpedal saying that "Well no no no! I did I say it's not a human right? I meant it is a human right, just not an infinite amount! You all must have misunderstood the very clear and concise way that I said people don't have a right to water!! It's all the internet's fault!"

And here you are, parroting Nestles backpedal, as if you really think a corporation like Nestle *wouldn't* privatise water and let poor people die to drive up costs.. Do you think corporations have some sort of conscious? 
CEOs also said tobacco is healthy.  Blind trust in people who only answer to share holders is unwise. 
Watch century of self. 
Always easy to say "out of context" when the words you say are dumb, but whatever.

Still unknown why.
Let me sum up. Mayor is democratic. Governor is republican. Governor appointed 2 positions to overrule more local elected officials (I. E. mayor). To help cut spending . One area to help was to move from one water source to another.
Plan is made, but it takes time to build pipe to new permanent source. So a temp line is laid to a salty river.

Salty river water corroded old lead pipes. Water is bad. Unhealthy. Sad. 

Really. Those at fault spread pretty much through a bunch of officials. Bad decisions were made, and there wasn't good timing. And the people of flint got fucked. 

And it's probably not saved MI any more money having to deal with this mess. 
On top of that. 
People > money 

> Agreed, except then who would be around to even try to help the citizens? 

Maybe the city council should have thought about that.

They could always contract out to OCP...
Each other for a bit until the city council relented? Paternalistic government intervention is not ALWAYS the answer. 
Sooooo, you got your information from Breitbart, or a Sinclair broadcasting group? That's who first claimed what you are saying. All of the things you claimed they are blaming are all of the ideals that Republicans support.

The mayor there is a Democrat, but the governor is Republican.
I agree.  And the government is saying the water is clean.  Either believe them or test it yourself.  Your comment was retarded.
> what's a good lab that offers water tests

Well, *if you trust the Environmental Protection Agency* (because of course they represent YOU and not businesses/corporations ... right?) then you can look up certified laboratories here: 
https://www.epa.gov/waterlabnetwork 

I am not sure what it costs, probably a lot more than a "cheap" water testing kit off Amazon (half of which were probably made in China).   
You also need to regularly **recheck** the water especially if anyone who might be using it might be pregnant, or you have taste, odor and staining issues (which I think the Flint people are still reporting).   
So, maybe it costs you $1000 a year if you can find a certified lab that you trust, and redo the test once or twice a year.   I am not sure the households  of Flint have that kind of extra cash lying around. 

EDIT: Maybe it costs more:

>The Water Systems Council[9] estimates average treatment costs at: less than $150 for bacteria; $600-$2,000 for pH; up to $800 for fluoride, nitrate, nitrite, radium, sodium or uranium; $800-$3,000 for arsenic, copper or lead; $100-$4,000 for methane gas; $800-$4,000 for pesticides; $2,000 for hardness; $3,000 for iron, manganese or sulfur; $3,000-$4,000 for MTBE; $3,000-$6,000 for radon; and $4,000 for tannins

In the end, we are just circling back to needing to trust a government to regulate an industry that has donated large sums of money to the officials who run the government that regulates them.

Fuck this well water
Yes, Hurley is literally a half mile from my place and the Court/Beecher intersection is right around the corner. Do you know where *you* live?
i wasnt stating it was their reasoning, hence the word maybe. moving IS expensive though. 
You've never had a mortgage have you.
No, I don't think they are faking it this time.  But I understand why Flint residents might be hesitant to take them at their word.
I guess because they are literally untrustworthy they can‚Äôt be trusted to tell the truth. 
I explained in my post. It‚Äôs not about being happy. These people broke the public‚Äôs trust and have done nothing to repair it. 
The initial change in water source was to save money. 
I agreed with his comment because you said  population is 100k including 400k in metro when that doesn't really make since since 400k>100k. Kind grammar nazish I guess

You must really hate FEMA then. 
Having access to clean drinking water should be a universal right in modern civilized nations. Can you actually say that you are proud of your country when there are so many people who can't even get clean drinking water?

Americans love to talk about their "enormous" pride for their country but they do fuck all to make it better if it doesn't directly benefit themselves. How could you possibly be proud of that?
It's usually the responsibility of whoever damages your property to fix it. The water utility pumped bad water down the lead pipes, removed the coating that made those pipes safe and then shrugged their shoulders. If the electric company fucked up and ruined all the wiring in your neighborhood with some kind of power surge and it was 100% their fault, why would you pay to replace the wires?
Oh, I get it. You better believe I get it. I'm just saying this is just as fucked up as a SWAT team breaking in your door, remaking your house, finding nothing, and then leaving yo to pay for the damages.

......except this time, they just poisoned your water pipes. I don't know how many thousands of dollars replacing those pipes will cost each home owner but I get the feeling most of these people are too poor to throw that much money at the problem.

So yeah, I get it. It's just also fucked up beyond belief.
He can take responsibility to sue for damages and replacement, but if you're poor then good luck. 
I think most people on this thread aren‚Äôt homeowners.  They don‚Äôt understand how many costs are associated with owning a house, nor how much we take responsibility for, just as a matter of course.  They probably also don‚Äôt understand home equity loans, nor, on a visceral level, that utilities and local governments are funded by individuals paying taxes or fees.  Fixing the pipes inside the houses is a direct transfer of money from people in Flint too poor to own a home, to homeowners.  
More good reasons why no one should "own" land.
Okay but do you think that's right? you had to deal with it so everyone else should have to as well?!?
I'm talking about what would make the most sense to do, not this nonsense about who owns the lines.
Ah ok good point!
No edit! You're the edit!

Seriously, I didn't edit either of those comments. Something else must of glitched.
Not if you live in like Monroe or something. Even Everett is decent.
Lake Baikal is a single lake with more fresh water than all the great lakes combined.
1. Water is pumped, bottled

2. Water is distributed 

3. Water is drank

4. Water is excreted(urination, sweat, etc)

5. **Water meanders back into water table where it eventually evaporates into the sky, turns into rain and goes back where it came from**

Water is a very unique resource where usage doesn't destroy it. It's not like oil. We keep using the same stuff over and over again for eternity. We're drinking the same water dinosaurs drank and pissed out 100 million years ago.

Have you not gotten to the class in elementary school explaining the water cycle yet and how things like the Great Lakes naturally stay full even with giant rivers continually pulling from them? Nestle's flow rate is barely a small creek. Tens of thousands of streams have all been collectively diverting millions of times more water every second from the region for millennia but it makes no difference because rain and snow neverendingly pours on more. 

That's why we don't care about charging people for drawing water from their own land in that area. Drop in the ocean is an overstatement. It doesn't deplete the resource. Your knowledge of water usage is about on par with a climate change deniers understanding of the climate. Anti-intellectualism is not the lens we should be viewing policy through.
What does blind trust have to do with this. I'm stating what he said because people constantly take his statement out of context. 
Username checks out. 
My mistake, we're talking about two different things then.

My post was about your statements "So you shouldn't get a water bill?" and "use as much as you want and not have to pay a dime?" I was pointing out that if you're the one pumping the water, that is the case. 25% of people in Michigan pump from their own well, so they don't pay a water bill, and can use as much as they want without paying a dime for it.

Edited for clarity
I assumed we were talking about water in Michigan specifically, if so, 25% of the population does.

Per page 95 of:
https://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/21st_Century_Infrastructure_Commission_Final_Report_1_544276_7.pdf

>Of Michigan's restdents and businesses, 25 percent obtain their water from more than 1 million private wells, the most of any state in the nation 
Which party made the decision to stop using the additive to slow corrosion in the pipes to save some money?  Democrats all the way up.  It doesn't matter which party is in control, everybody but the corporations gets screwed.
Oh so flint was better before the repub gov? No it wasn't

I as an American have zero pride in my country. We're doomed. We've developed an incredibly sick culture. I just hope the world puts us down before we bring everyone else down with us
The Flint water utility is owned and managed by the City of Flint.  If the water company pays, it just means that the taxpayers and water users of Flint pay.  The value of replacing the pipes inside the house accrues entirely to the homeowner, but you are asking the people in Flint who are too poor to own a house to subsidize that cost.  You could try suing the 2 or 3 individuals at the water agency who made a bad decision, but they haven‚Äôt got enough money anyway.  See the problem here?  It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúnot my fault, I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for it.‚Äù
Didn't realize it was bad water. Thought it was just pipes degrading over years from normal use. Thanks
Somebody needs to own it. 

Unless you are saying the state should just own and control everything, but that would be really stupid, so I'm sure you meant something else. 
Yes.  When you buy the house, you buy the pipes.  You own it.  Why would the pipes be any different than fixing your roof or repainting your living room?
The thing that makes the most sense is for the people who own the defective stuff to fix their defective stuff.  If your roof fails, your house will become uninhabitable.  That's your problem.  Toilet backs up and poop fills your house, you fix it.  Or the city condemns your property.

Houses are expensive.  You have to fix things all the time.  I probably spend $10,000 a year on my house keeping it working.  Your house is your problem, not the taxpayer's problem.  
Weird. IDK.
Yeah but then you have to live in Everett.
I looked it up and you're right!
Did I say it depleted the resources? I was referring to waste, which is why I used the word waste. There will be laws passed soon enough giving the state money so it'll get better. Regulations on bottled water need to change.
So you prefer to talk about the minority in a conversation about the majority? 
Who cares what team is responsible, if neither team wants to fix it then fuck them both
But Republicans made the decision to switch the water source without checking to see if it'll erode the pipes. 

I honestly don't care about blaming red or blue. I just want the shit fixed.

It‚Äôs one of those days, just look at all the downvotes I‚Äôm accumulating for my unfunny comments. r/news is really not having a good day right now.
Well then. The maths are on point because statistics are actually maths. Thank You for informing me of this. It makes sense, I‚Äôve just never thought about it like that before. I think of math like add and decimals and geometry and shit, but not statistics.

Why can't you compare fruit?

Please go see more of the world then. Not just what you see on TV. Please go see. If you still feel that way then I have no idea how someone can feel so entitled

Why does somebody need to own it?  Does somebody need to own the air?  The rivers?  The moon?
In retrospect, I *may* have done a quick edit to add the last line of that second comment. I honestly can't remember now.
What is this the 90s'? Once the paper mill left the smell isn't there anymore.
I like when people don't hold on to the argument after realizing their mistake.  Good show.
What waste are they leaving in their path in the state? And they aren't forcing people to buy it. Everyone is free to stop buying bottled water if they don't like the use of plastic. 
What are you on about? Nestle is part of that minority, so yes, the laws governing that 25% are absolutely what this conversation is about.
That was my point.
> I honestly don't care about blaming red or blue. I just want to shit fixed.

At this point, fuck them both. They'll squabble and complain with their hoards of brain-dead fucking supporters while people have to use unsafe water. Flint's situation is a national embarrassment.
That was the point I was making.
Mmm no that was after the initial debacle, the local dems made the decision to stop adding it to the local treatment. Both parties are at fault and only care about stealing from you, and taking money from corporations.

Lots of redditors probably also just follow the daisy chain pattern of alternating up and downvoting on what looks like an argument.

Companies aren't required to report how much tap water they take, nor are they required to report how much they pump for bottled water. And yes...Nestle has been caught selling tapwater. 

We don't need to become rich, but the state deserves fair compensation.

When they end up taking so much it impacts a lot of our surface water...then it'll be game on.

Looks very promising.  Building a base on Mars might be very feasible with plenty of accessible ice.
I thought they claimed they found some, but it turned out to be wrong. Oh well, maybe they found some again
We've known for a while about ice water on mars, primarily at the poles. This discovery seems to show it's more plentiful and easier to access than previously known.
That's science for you! Once they find one example that they can tune their instruments on, they can get a known good reading and use that strategy to look for other matching readings, and then they need to confirm other samples to confirm that they are getting correct readings 
We saw that in the documentary Total Recall that mass has huge ice reserves and aliens did this millions of years ago. 
Remember back in the 90s when they told us there were no other planets with water? And now there's water on like every fucking planet lol

Or, Nestle *gives* all the water on Mars to everyone on Earth while it pumps even more fresh water from Terran aquifers.  Don't worry, though, because your elected representatives put the well being of all humans above corporate interests.  In fact, come to think of it, Nestle taking all the fresh water is part of *god's* plan.  For as foretold in the bible, the Lord sayeth unto the #wickedhumans, Lo, for I have set aside this fresh water for the Kingdom of Nestle, and you shall take all the waters of Marah.

oF COUrse life once was mars .. they found WATER REserves .. who was reSERVING t he water???
Life probably started there and migrated here with an asteroid impact. 
Most likely it is going to be about the same type of life that existed up to the point that Earth was when mars lost its atmosphere if at all.  There is a possibility of life though deeper into the planet but not likely.
Then mormons will claim Jesus, after visiting Israel and America, went to Mars.
And that the natives migrated to a nearby planet once they depleted their resources. 
Seems like we would have detected evidence of that by now. Soil minerals alone would have been a pretty good clue. So far no sign of anything.
And don't forget to nuke the poles! Vaporize all that frozen water and CO2 and puff up the atmosphere.

Edit: Reddit has no subscript whaaa...
Always thought we could just start throwing ice asteroids at Mars. The heat from the impacts and the additional ice/water could make oceans.
PFCs would be a better choice than CFCs.  CFCs will complicate building an ozone layer.
Or just start the reactor

What makes building on Mars more likely or reasonable if there is access to ice?
There's a lot more problems with a Martian base than just the water.
I would be interested in seeing what‚Äôs in the water... is it literally water? Or just a huge fluid reserve that may or may not be water as we know it on earth.
There's still a lot of feasibility issues with building a base on Mars (many of which involve the long distance between Earth and Mars).

A lot of water ice to harvest would make it a bit easier and cheaper long term, but there's other much more pressing issues then water.
True. They saw some formations in dry land that looked as though they had been eroded by flowing water. Turns out it was flowing sand. 
That was surface ice. NASA has known about *some* subsurface sheet ice for a long time. This "discovery" is just revising how much subsurface ice they know about (more than before). It's not terribly exciting, but the news cycle demands overhyped breakthroughs.
That was flowing water. Ice has been confirmed there for a long time.
Is it possible that there is intelligent life there (say living underground) that somehow adapted in those conditions and remain undetected? If they exist, isn't it possible that they could see our colonizing efforts (and our probes) as an invasion of sorts and hence retaliate?
I distinctly do not remember that, it was hypothesized in the 1990‚Äôs that Mars did have water, as well as many of the moons of Saturn and Venus.
those are carbon dioxide ice caps not water ice

Isn't the issue with Mars' atmosphere that it was stripped away, presumably by a mechanism (solar winds? I don't recall) that is ongoing, so you'd need to continuously regenerate it to maintain it?

Like, this might totally be feasible (the rate of attrition may be minimal and only significant on geological or astronomical timescales), but still, it wouldn't be a one-and-done.
> And don't forget to nuke the poles!

The most realistic approach that I've see involves kinetic strikes on the poles, same as nukes but would work a lot better.  Grab a bunch of comets/asteroids, fling them into the gravity well, and smash the shit out of the poles with them.  Throwing tons of gasses into the atmosphere, adding a not insignificant amount of thermal energy, and adding additional mass to the planet.

The proposal did use nukes to steer the asteroids using an Orion drive.
Ahh yes, the Allan Parsons Project. 
No he ain't. He's Laotian. Ain't ya, Mr. Kahn?
Step 1 - Nukes

Step 2 - melt the ice

result - Ocean!
Very incorrect.
Soon, as in a million years or so.
Mars most definitely has an atmosphere,  with winds and everything. 

It's a *bit* thinner than we'd prefer though.
Screwwwww youuuuuu!

We'll definitely be living on Mars before we have the capability to teraform planets. A self contained base/colony would be much easier to accomplish. Teraforming a couple of football fields worth of space is more realistic. 
Not possible with current tech.  We couldn't produce the power necessary to the planet and without an atmosphere, all that heat would just radiate into space.
Terraforming Mars is such a long term project that we can wait a couple hundred years or so and it won't make that much difference.  
I think sending some choice asteroids on a collision course with Mars might be a good bet to make a rudimentary atmosphere. We could do that now but our modeling of the effects probably isn't up to the task yet.
Wouldn't it be *way* easier to terraform it if we were already living there?
Is that a thing? Does ice get harder the colder it gets? I would think that it would to a point, but not a linear decrease  
A shovel's not exactly ideal for ice in general. 
Yeah it‚Äôs got a greenhouse gas feed back loop going on. 
Some scientists think it's possible that there's life in the clouds. 
Venus is my rebuttal for climate change deniers who think CO2 has a greenhouse saturation point (a cutoff for how much heat it can trap).
Oh man you got me thinking what if Venus used to be like Earth and mankind actually originated from it. The ancient civilization stayed there until it became inhabitable and ascended to their new home, Earth, and left their own they used to call.. Hell.
All while looking to see if they had to escape a second time if the new planet went the same way they looked to the sky to the next closest planet they had named Heaven.

Oh, sure they SAY it's water from pristine ice buried for millions of years on Mars, but all they really do is fill those bottles with plain old Martian tap water!
More like for 100 billion liters, you are giving Nestle far too much credit.
Ha, as though they care about having contracts.
Mars will lose that fight. People on Earth will always be stronger because of the gravity difference. Wait, it may not matter because of weapons... I can't recall the last war that was settled by wrestling/powerlifting.

10 years later we discover that water from Mars is ridden with some new type of radiation we hadn't found before. Kids 50 years from then learn about it and look back thinking "What complete idiots. Drinking radiation-contaminated water daily."

I'd still drink it, that shit sounds cool as fuck.
This is better than my idea for bottling Flint, Michigan tap water and marketing it as an "Accelerating Energy Drink" named **Lead Foot**. 
I'm glad someone got it though! :-)
Mars will become a forge world. The largest and most advanced in all of the glorious Imperium. Even the smallest of her foundries will span continents. 


Yeah, is there any downside to exploiting a lifeless rock? There's no local lifeforms to kill, let alone sentient life, and neither of those have stopped us before.

And it's not like the views there "have been enjoyed for generations" or anything. It is literally a rock.

The one downside would be if we make it hard to determine whether life was there before, because we've contaminated it.
It's the role of the planetary protection office.
Honestly Nat Geo being out of his hands is one of the few parts of the Disney-Fox deal that genuinely excited me. Is Disney perfect? No. Do I trust them with something like Nat Geo way more then I do Fox? Absolutely.

Yea we're gonna be facing some more..."internal" issues to take care of first.
Twice that of an actual human's, I should say. ;)
Yeah. Ancient Egyptians actually came from Mars.
But surely, the sheer amount of water on Mars is brand new information, right?
Hm, fair enough.

I never thought I would live to experience a real life Mars Rounder believer. Everyone knows we faked the teliscopes in the backyurd
It's been observed. 
Well yeah, water on Mars has been largely theoretical and they've found traces of underground water activity and ice, but this says "huge" reserves. I think it's pretty amazing.
Folks like Elon Musk think it is the only way to have a backup of Earth civilisation. No one is ever going to live on Mars with our current technology, or perhaps ever.
Their are about a dozen nations with enough nuclear weapons to end human civilization on earth if not wipe us out completely. All of these nations have early warning systems to detect a nuclear launch/attack. I know of 3 publicized incidents where these systems have incorrectly detected a nuclear attack and a retaliatory strike has only been curtailed by 1 or 2 people saying 'hold up, something isn't right here'. Statistically, we are going to blow ourselves up eventually. Now factor in all the other possible civilization ending events (asteroid, disease, fkn skynet, etc). If we want humanity to survive long term it's clear we need to be able to colonize other planets. 
That's just what an insufferable Inner Planet person would say...

In Situ Resource Utilization: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/isru/

It takes a fantastic amount of propellant to lift stuff off of Earth and send it to Mars.  To bring it back requires far more.  So to be viable ongoing operations out there, you have to mostly live of the land.

Water, and its components, is a huge resource that humans need a lot of.  The machine it would take to mine rocks, bake the water out of the rocks before processing it into stuff we would use would never get off the ground.  So it's nice that instead of that machine, a shovel will do.  We can manage to get a shovel to Mars.  A tunnel boring machine, probably not.
Air, water, rocketfuel, and eventually food production.  
Sure, but air won't be one of them.
I think pure ice 100 meters thick and one meter deep on Mars is pretty exciting.
If we take Earth life's as a ballpark example, it would take about half a billion years after the planet became conducive to life to evolve single-celled organisms, and 3+ billion years after that to evolve multicellular life. Add to that more than half billion years to evolve sentience.

According to estimates, Mars had lost most of its atmosphere already by the time Earth started developing life. This gives it less than a billion years from start to ruin (all planets are about the same age of 4.5-ish billion years old) to form sentient life with at least modern Earth technology. 

Also, bear in mind that for much of that time, life on Mars would have been getting progressively more difficult.

And don't forget that no signs of those hypothetical guys were left on the surface even though they developed a technological civilization.

Is it "possible"? Technically I guess so, but for a given value of "possible" that is also tremendously improbable. 
At what point in the 90s? Maybe this was a mainstream theory but it never made it into my elementary or middle school text books or science class in the 90s :/ 

Constantly told there was no other planet with water 
"When the Martian polar caps were first viewed through telescopes, most scientists believed that they were made of water ice, like the polar caps on Earth. Like Earth, Mars has a North and South Pole. But while Earth's polar ice caps consist solely of water ice, Mars' polar caps are a combination of water ice and carbon dioxide ice.¬†"

That's why man is more dangerous.
Or will simply shrug, because few religions teach that life only ever originated on earth. What's more interesting to me is how non-theists seem to be looking towards the sky for signs of life in order to fill some sort of god-shaped void. It seems humans are evolutionally geared towards religious belief of one sort or another, and non-theists fill some sort of...loneliness (perhaps?)...with the idea that we're probably not alone in this vast cosmos if we can only find it on other planets. That there's surely intelligent life out there...somewhere. And there well may be, but still, it's interesting how some seek the divine to fill that void, and some seek...aliens (and plenty, of course, are fine with both).

It‚Äôs just a theory I read a while ago no need to get panties in a bunch. 
So you're saying there's a chance!?
No, he just meant probability > 0.
What is the probability of life developing from a puddle of goop?

**Edit:** Before you guys go through this thread and downvote everything I say and respond with comments like "you seem to not have a very strong grasp on the underlying mathematical concepts of probability" I would like to present to you the encyclopedia entry for mathematical concepts of probability:

>Thousands of scientists, engineers, economists, and other professionals use the methods of probability and statistics in their work, aided by readily available computer software packages. **But there is no strong consensus on the nature of chance in the universe, nor on the best way to make inferences from probability, so the subject continues to be of lively interest to philosophers.** It is also part of daily experience‚Äîthe weather, traffic conditions, sports, the lottery, the stock market, insurance, to name just a few‚Äîabout which everyone has opinions.

>The use of probability in science and technology is often quite technical, involving elaborate models and advanced mathematics that are beyond the understanding of nonspecialists. **High-profile controversies may hinge on oversimplification by advocates and the media, unexplored biases, or a lack of appreciation of the extent of uncertainty in scientific results.** Yet policy decisions based on such flawed evidence may have far-reaching economic and social consequences. Awareness of the role of probability is thus essential for judging the quality of empirical evidence, and this implies a moral responsibility for citizens of a democratic society.

"lack of appreciation of the extent of uncertainty in scientific results."

This would be the main problem with our society today and the people in this thread who are so certain they are right.
It is possible.  They might have cloned a Hitler that is immune to AIDS too.

Solution: siphon CO2 from Venus's atmosphere and put it on Mars, therefore terraforming to planets in one go
Yes but it wasnt instant. If we could instill an atmosphere, it would supposedly last 1000 years. 
Without a magnetosphere there isn't really a way to keep a significant atmosphere on Mars long-term.
The easiest solution to this wouldn't be to put a bunch of asteroids in orbit or run a copper wire around the planet. The best concept is to make a large extendable electromagnet satellite, put it in the Lagrange point between the sun and Mars, power that sucker up and you've got a shield against solar radiation. But you do still have to deal with cosmic radiation from other places in the Galaxy.
> Isn't the issue with Mars' atmosphere that it was stripped away, presumably by a mechanism (solar winds? I don't recall) that is ongoing, so you'd need to continuously regenerate it to maintain it?

That is a process that takes millions of years.  If we have the technology to terraform Mars with a thick breathable atmosphere, we'd have the technology to replenish it as it slowly is stripped away.
Really? You're just going to blatt blatt on the guy?
Whatever you were saying you hadn't finish that. 
I'd definitely go. I don't care if I implode on contact with space dust or whatever happens when you travel to Mars. I'm in my mid-20s I got nothing to lose

Maybe we should just heat up space then? Problem solved!
So create an atmosphere then 
You know.. I'm gonna admit, I read it in a book once, and now I am questioning it? Just read a few things online that seems to debate it? But also the mix of martian sand with ice would likely be weaker and more likely to shear? (Shouldn't tie it together like wood fibre in pykrete, right?) Hmm, I'mm trying to track down what book I read it in, but having little luck at the moment.

EDIT: I *think* it was in Encounter with Tiber, tbh?
The slower a molecule vibrates the closer other molecules can get to each other. Remember things shrink in the cold and things swell in the heat.
[There are actually several different phases of ice depending on pressure and temperature, each with different characteristics.](https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Graphics-Geol/ROCKMIN/MetPhaseDiagrams/IcePhase.gif) . I imagine there might even be some weird quantum voodoo ice as well.
A shaped charge would make quicker work of it.
Well, much of the CO2 on Venus is a result of the constant volcanism. It's more than a feedback loop.
Probably like the hot spring extermophiles or the sulphuric acid producing [snotite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snottite) bacteria in the mines.

We should launch a space blimp to float in the more tolerable layers and conduct research from.
aren't the clouds highly acidic? I wonder what kind of life can be sustained there, and what it sustains on.

Pretty sure its old martian greywater.
I think the martians would have a gravitational advantage for interplanetary warfare. It would be easier for them to launch against the earthlings. Plus mars will probably mostly be an industrial robot planet inhabited only by the ultra wealthy factory owners.

Perchlorates, perchlorates everywhere. Or maybe alien bacteria.
$9.99/20oz is a pipedream, I'm willing to bet it would be *at least* $500/20oz, and they'd still sell out. Think of it, water from another planet? They could charge anything they want.

Yeah, we'd better thoroughly examine anything before we even start any extraction meant for consumption
Dumb question, if we take from mars and use it on earth, wouldnt we be adding to earths mass, therefore slowing our rotation down and becoming mars our selves? 
Which is a branch of NASA correct? 
The worst Disney would do is exploit it for all it's worth. The worst Fox would do is subtly change reporting to represent a specific world view. 

Also, Disney has the budget to support it. If it happens, expect Nat Geo documentaries to get a lot better. (They've been terrible, in my humble opinion). 
That's misleading, no?  There were layoffs across the board and not limited to any one specific department.

Sure, I get the fact that an onsite resource is far more advantageous than having to rely on being supplied from off-world. My question, worded more specifically I suppose, would be regarding why water seems to be lauded above all else when it comes to Mars exploration. It seems to be the holy grail of it (even above and beyond the chances of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life) and I was just wondering if there was any specific reason why water seems to be considered more important than other resources that would surely be needed should we land on Mars.
Cool time to be alive
what is the difference between thick and deep?
The entire decade, I was in college in the 80s and water ice on Mars the was topic of discussion in astronomy and astrophysics classes.  If your elementary school teachers said there was no strong evidence of *liquid* water, that would be correct in the 90s,  though the hypothesis of liquid water cores  for the moons of Jupiter and Saturn were considered reasonably likely to be correct.

Little do they know about the mole people who inhabit our precious sewers. 
I think it‚Äôs a little different to worship a deity or wish to discover other intelligent life. There are similarities but it‚Äôs not the same thing. 
It isn't filling the same void, at all.

This is the problem with religious people, you simply do not know what it is like to not believe in any of that shit yet you put yourself in the shoes anyways. We don't think like this. It has nothing to do with filling in anything. It has nothing to do with loneliness. It has everything to do with learning how everything works. That's it. Finding intelligent life will help us better understand where the great filter lies. Right now we have no idea. Which means we could still be behind it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter

The desire to learn is driving this. What else is there to do, anyways? Die? I'd like to get some answers before I inevitably turn back into stardust.
I‚Äôve never heard the idea that non-theists want to search for alien life in order to fill a void. I‚Äôm sure some do, though.
Many, or maybe I should say some, Christians believe there is no way dinosaurs could have existed millions of years ago because God created the earth only 6,000 years ago. 
Seems like youre the one with the bunched panties.. jus sayin
You're only moving the puddle of goop with this hypothesis.

Occam's Razor fits perfectly here.

Option 1: Life developed somewhere else (0.X% chance) and got here on an asteroid (0.Y% chance). (Total chance of 0.X% * 0.Y%.)

Option 2: Life developed here (0.X% chance).

Without evidence that favors 1 over 2, you go with 2 because it makes fewer assumptions.
What's that saying? Leave a bunch of hydrogen atoms for enough time and it'll start contemplating existence?
Pretty good considering you‚Äôre here 
K-kurwa...
Hold my kielbasa, I'm going in!
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter
The Great Material Continuum.
So... Instead of dragging asteroids to earth to mine let's surround mars in ferrous asteroids to create a magnetosphere! 
Long term in planetary scales. Millions of years.
Apparently in this case "long term" means something like a million years. So not something to worry about.
Depends on how long term it is.  If the atmosphere goes away at 100k years, it‚Äôs less of an issue as compared to it going away in a couple days.
It depends on what you mean by long term, it took something like a hundred million years for it to lose its atmosphere after the magnetic field died.  
You just create a nano black hole.  It falls to the center of Mars and reheats the core as it slowly consumes the planet.
What is long-term? Long-term when it comes to a planet is quite different than long-term when it comes to humans.

I mean if we are talking a million years...
Venus doesn't have a magnetosphere either and it's much closer to the sun.

Besides, I'm sure we could figure something out in the few million years the atmosphere lasts.
Hell yeah I am. Spreading misinformation by being uninformed is a major problem. 

When scientists say "Mars can't sustain an atmosphere without a magnetosphere." they're talking about on planetary timescales. Millions of years.
Heck I'd go with you man, mid 20s, nothing to lose, and a whole world to pioneer, but sadly there is very little chance of us being ready to send Martian Colonists in any timely manner for us. Maybe in 20 years if our political climate cools down and we get a few more world leaders willing to put all our efforts together to get people there, then we'll have a chance, but it'll be too late for us to go.
We are terraforming Earth, and that's the problem.
Good plan.  Best way to achieve that is to get the Sun to go super nova.
Mars' core has cooled. Any atmosphere you would create would be blown away by the solar winds.

If we ever live on Mars it will be in contained domes, I don't think we'll ever be able to step outside
Got 100,000 Fusion reactors for the power needed to melt the ice to create one?  We'd also need to get a magnetic field going.
> Remember things shrink in the cold and things swell in the heat.

With the exception of water, which actually expands when it is frozen. 
This is also true. 
There are large organisms that have adapted to high acidity and warm water. Some sharks live near a hot underwater volcano! Cool stuff 
Hydrothermal vents in the ocean are highly acidic and there is all kinds of life associated with them. Largely microbial, but still!

the fact that they think fact-checker is no longer valueable for their newspaper speak tremendously about their credibility. 
I'd use a giant balloon. 
We'll harness the planet's enerkachoo.
I feel like Kenan Thompson has said this at some point.
Well, maybe dropping all those rocks on Earth was a bad call...
Like the other poster said, air (oxygen), water and fuel are staples you need in vast quantities.  If you want to do almost any other chemical process, water is a component of almost every solvent.  Almost everything on Earth revolves around water.  So yes, it is the holy grail.  Water and energy.

Why Mars?  Gravity.  Although a gravity well makes moving things to and from costly and inefficient, humans need it for proper function in the longer term.  Also, the only other equally bountiful readily accessible water in such quantities is on Ceres, which is twice as far away.
I will leave the obvious joke for someone else.

There is only one meter of Martian soil on top of this deposit of almost pure ice, which then goes 100 meters deeper.  That makes it accessible.  If it were under 100 meters of soil the cost of getting materials to Mars to access it would be too high.

Ice is not just an invaluable resource, it is also a radiation shield.  So ice mines make great human habitat.
No they straight up said time and time again that there was no form of water and no evidence at all. No mention of any theory of liquid water cores. The possibility of water on another planet was treated exactly the same as the possibility of alien life on another planet - with ridicule.

Maybe this had to do with our underfunded department and using ancient textbooks. Either way, we were not informed. Let's be honest though, we can just add this to the list of everything else we learned in school that was wrong. 

Glad to hear it was mainstream idea though! 
I imagine it would be a Mars bar with nougat in the middle.
Give me the news. 
*heh* Oh, Kif. Robots can't be killed. How do you expect the killbots to reach their preset kill-limit if we send in robots? Plus, do you know how much it would cost to replace precious robots? Soldiers are born, Kif, machines have to be built. Now send in the men!
huh. so they are saying they didn't exist at all? Like it's some great conspiracy? 
I have like 4 people attacking me over the use of the word probably in a hypothetical comment about something that might have happened. 

Edit: a word. 
My point really was just that probability should not be the driving force of science because many improbable discoveries have been made throughout recorded history which turns everything on it's head.  I'm not saying he's right, or you're wrong, or that this method or that is the best way to achieve the best results.  I am saying that we shouldn't narrow the scope of our research based on what we believe to be probable at this point in time.  

History would suggest that as we continue forward we are going to find out we are completely wrong about many things.  If someone wants to explore a wild theory they should absolutely be free to do so without criticism or people explaining why they are probably wrong because another theory is a tiny fraction of a decimal more probable.  Which is why I asked the question, "What is the probability of life developing from a puddle of goop?" because we don't actually know that do we.  Whatever the number is... it's fucking tiny.  Like so tiny we probably wouldn't even have a name for the number of 0's after the decimal point, but we can't even confirm *that* until we can successfully recreate it.
Maybe in the process of investigating life coming from Mars we make some other incredible discovery that we wouldn't have made if we weren't looking that far.
I say cast the line way out there, start reeling it in and see what it sticks on.
So it definitely came from a puddle of goop, then?
Uhh, no thanks
From have to want and back again.

I just binged DS9 over the last 2 weeks for probably my 4th or 5th time. Such a great series.
Cmon, Magneto's not just going to sit up in the atmosphere all day. Not with Charles around.
I like your style. 
Also depends on what you mean by atmosphere. It still has a lot of gas surrounding it, it just isn't enough for us.
A black hole that small would immediately collapse on itself
Our sun doesn't have enough mass to go supernova, but if we wait 5 billion years or so (give or take a couple), it'll start shifting into a red giant.  And oh buddy...the solar system will *really* start to cook (at least in our neighborhood).
Maybe we could just move the sun closer to mars 
No but we have one giant fusion reactor in the middle of our solar system and the ability to build fleets of orbiting mirrors as well as high strength greenhouse gases (perfluorocarbons) to help retain heat.  

We can also build a magnetic shielding satellite at the Mars-Sun L1 point (which is difficult but doable).  Even if that doesn't pan out, the magnetic field problem isn't as big a deal as people think it is, it took hundreds of millions of years for Mars to lose its atmosphere after it lost its magnetic field, we'll be able to replace the atmosphere faster than it goes away. 
We'll figure it out. 
Waters max destiny is apparently at 4¬∞ C, presuming at our atmospheric pressure.
Actually, water only "shrinks" when going from a liquid to a solid. Both ice and liquid water expand with heat and contract as they cool.
We don't have jump drives yet and we all know space aids comes from using jump drives.
No, no. This is water from Mars, PA. 
Yeah, that sounds super preachy. That was a Nat Geo documentary?

Oh yes. They ***float***.

It won't even take that long.  As stars age, they become more intense, even on the main sequence.  A billion years from now, the oceans on Earth will boil, even accounting for the Earth spiraling away from the Sun due to the Sun's continual loss of mass.  However, Mars should reap the benefits.  Of course, with it's tiny mass and lack of magnetosphere, it's not going to be much of a garden spot.  
Which is exactly why we don't have jump drives.

We really need to get off this rock.
Awesome.  Glad I just finished th3 second book
And it would exist if there weren't some people that actually believed it.
No, it really is you. The scientific process is based on probabilities and then finding evidence to create theories with which we can interprete and understand the world. You just propose that we work on assumptions. The last couple of hundred years have proved that scientific thinking is far more able to produce results than alternatives.
There's some sterling rhetoric.
I tend to agree, but the hostility of the universe tends towards a maximum.  
Science is about making predictions and trying to disprove them. Not that complicated 
[Thought you might like to read a little bit about probabilities before you go talking out your ass trying to sound smart in the future.](http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/probability-basic-concepts-mathematical-probability)

>Thousands of scientists, engineers, economists, and other professionals use the methods of probability and statistics in their work, aided by readily available computer software packages. **But there is no strong consensus on the nature of chance in the universe, nor on the best way to make inferences from probability, so the subject continues to be of lively interest to philosophers.** It is also part of daily experience‚Äîthe weather, traffic conditions, sports, the lottery, the stock market, insurance, to name just a few‚Äîabout which everyone has opinions.

>The use of probability in science and technology is often quite technical, involving elaborate models and advanced mathematics that are beyond the understanding of nonspecialists. High-profile controversies may hinge on oversimplification by advocates and the media, **unexplored biases, or a lack of appreciation of the extent of uncertainty in scientific results.** Yet policy decisions based on such flawed evidence may have far-reaching economic and social consequences. Awareness of the role of probability is thus essential for judging the quality of empirical evidence, and this implies a moral responsibility for citizens of a democratic society.


The problem with people like you is you get by using nicely constructed sentences that really make you sound confident in what you're saying, and that shit works on most people.  You should learn learn to be the biggest critic of your own beliefs and challenge yourself to really understand them.  Because everything that you said sounded smart enough but was complete hot air.
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.
Nobody seems to understand that we don't know what the odds are for life developing in a puddle of goop because we don't know for sure that a puddle of goop can create life.  We have not recreated that.  So to say the odds are more likely that it developed here is not technically correct because we have no actual idea of what those odds are.  To tell somebody who has a theory that life came from Mars their theory is unlikely because of another theory which hasn't been proven doesn't make sense.  For all we know we find some missing link on Mars that shows us how the building blocks for life actually come together to become life.  We do not have an answer for that other than, the building blocks were here and the conditions were perfect.  We don't know exactly what that means but that's our best theory.

Yes... I get it... Occam's Razor.. let's assume the simplest version of events is the correct one and go from there.  But sometimes asking a whole lot of crazy questions can yield answers you didn't realize you were looking for.  There is more than one way to put together a puzzle.  Looking for the next right/ logical piece to fit the little picture you are working on can sometimes be a huge boondoggle and you just have to scatter out all the pieces until you see a pattern and work from a different area.
I'm a little bit confused here... Nestl√©'s defence is that some of the samples were past their sale by date. What does that have to do with its lead content? Have they figured out some form of alchemy where the lead magically appears after its sale by date? Also why are is there an acceptable level of lead in the food to begin with?
They actually have uranium.  After a little while it turns into lead.
I like how our fuel is unleaded but our food is not

Haha...just as I thought.
 "...inspection of a Brazilian coffee plantation where seventeen men, women and children were found to be victims of human trafficking and were freed from conditions analogous to slavery. Two children, ages 14 and 15, had also worked picking coffee on the plantation."
Slave labor. No more products from Nestl√© I take it after Obama banned slave produced consumer goods.
Isn't Nestle the same company that recently came out with the position that drinking water was a privilege and that people should not consider clean water a right? 
Nestle has unethical business practices? I had no idea! It's not like they forced formula on third world countries in the pursuit of more profit in the 1970s, resulting in mothers losing the ability to breastfeed and infants becoming malnourished... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott
I wonder why it cost fucking $26 for a tin of formula.  Jesus, what is that baby eating?  Gold?
Everything is price fixed people. Fuck. This should surprise no one and Piss off everyone.

Good. Keep that lean healthy meat out of my delicious beef!!
2 issues :

1. drugs injected into horses, making these animal not fit for human consumption (the main issue).  Horse meat fit for human consumption is more expensive then beef.  Use logic to deduce the kind of meat they used.

2.  fraud  (lying to consumers)  Imagine paying to buy a diamond ring and finding out you were sold a fake.   
They're fine for eating.  But, it's still a problem.  Unlike cockroaches, horses don't just fall into meat processors from time to time.  This means that there was very active deception at some point in the process and that it's likely that there are other worse lies.
they certainly kept the "healthy"  out of your beef.   That you can be assured off.

Horse meat is more expensive then beef, but unlucky for you, they did not use this more expensive healthy meat.

Just throwing an alternative out there.   Fromm is a family owned and just as high quality.   Price points are about the same as well.

Get ready to see it go to shit.
I feed my cat this, I no longer will be doing so. 
So, what do we have for alternatives? This is all we feed our dog, and as everyone else in this thread has mentioned, this will be going the way of Iams soon.
For perspective, General Mills is buying Blue Buffalo for about the same price Disney bought both Star Wars and Marvel at $4 Billion each.
Taste of the Wild, Orijen, Acana, Frahm all top quality dog foods. Haven't given my dog anything else for 3 years now.
Orijen for my cat, though I used to feed him Blue Buffalo. General Mills will cut corners to make money on this deal. 
To any one still using Blue Buffalo I would advise to stop, and research/purchase a different brand. They have been the contention of several lawsuits, ie willfully selling contaminated food, suing their own suppliers that mislabeled ingredients, on quality of materials, false advertising lawsuits.

I see nothing beneficial to consumers due to this buyout. GM is just expanding its large array of products. Purina is owned by Nestle corp, IAMS is owned by ~~P&G~~ Mars Inc., Smuckers owns a few of the cheap ones like Kibbles & Bits, Meow mix and a bunch of pet "treats" like milkbones and snausasages. 

That is why you see these other food conglomerates trying to run a similar adjacency in their business. I simply don't see them hitting the adjacency and still able to make a quality product. Probably good for shareholders long term as the BB brand has great marketing and consumer brand identity and people will continue to buy it regardless of all the quality issues and lies the company purports in its advertising.
So glad  I‚Äôve just made the choice to return to university and leave the Pet Food retail industry. This is going to be a fucking nightmare. 
Fuck. I've been raising ferrets for 10 years. Tried so many different ferret foods that were on the market and they were shit because they were all full of grain. Made the switch to Blue Buffalo and my ferrets were in much better health. Fuller coat, more muscle mass, fewer incidents of insuloma. Yeah, it was a bit more expensive, but it was worth it for the overall improvement in health, and it's been readily available in most major pet stores. 
"General Mill's plans to acquire Blue Buffalo...Kraft-Heinz, known for its ferocious appetite to acquire food companies and its ruthless cost-cutting approach...ready for its next acquisition, and General Mills has been identified as a logical target."

Rip Blue Buffalo dog food

But why wouldn't they, this sounds like a huge market that has been growing
"consumers spent $20 billion on pet care, $10 billion of which was on dog food, according to Nielsen"

I also think some of mills stuff tastes like it'd be better as dog food, maybe they want Blue's recipe for their cereal.
Damn. Well looks like I'll have to find my pets some new food. 
Another one bites the dust.
Wasn't there a big boycott on Blue Buffalo because it was being made in China? If anything GM will just pump out another shit brand like Ol Roy but use the name to rake in some suckers.
Guess I'm not buying Blue Buffalo for my cat anymore. Wouldn't doubt the food will now have a bunch of grains in it.
Do not fuck up my dog's food, General Mills.
I guess I will have to start making homemade dog food if I ever get another dog.  It's not too difficult to make in bulk and freeze.
Fromm,  Nutrisource, Acana, Orijen, Zignature, Nulo
Is this the pet food company that tries to convince complete idiots that their dogs should eat like wolves?
Who makes Call Of The Wild?
If you can get it I recommend Fromm dog and cat food. It‚Äôs a family owned business in Wisconsin and they‚Äôre fantastic. My pets love it and we have never had any issues. 
Dang that‚Äôs my cat‚Äôs food, better stock up before it turns to illness-causing crap. 
Doesn't the Blue Buffalo brand have a bunch of problems with it anyway? Is that the brand people kept finding mold on the bottom of the bag and it was killing their pets?

Edit: [Ya, Blue Buffalo has a mold problem that kills pets](http://www.businessinsider.com/blue-buffalo-moldy-dog-food-photo-accusation-2017-4)
For all the people here who worry that B.B. is now going to be crap, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs already crap! 
Anyone with any education in veterinary care and/or experience in veterinary medicine will tell you that it is some of the worst (but very well marketed) food on the market. 
I‚Äôve seen G.I. problems, skin problems, allergy problems, weight problems, etc. that can be attributed to their line of foods. 
They are also grossly overpriced. 
I‚Äôm not a doctor but I do work for a few of them who are very well educated in animal nutrition, regularly read studies and stay updated on dietary research. 
I‚Äôve never met a veterinarian, technician, or assistant who would feed their own pet Blue Buffalo. 
Switched to Performatrin Ultra almost 8 years back.  Have had no problems whatsoever.  Go Canada.

http://www.performatrin.com/performatrin-ultra/
[Merrick](https://www.merrickpetcare.com/) is an absolutely superior alternative. Family owned from Texas. Fantastic selection and comparable in price to Blue Buffalo.
Damn. So what to switch to?
Well shit, my dogs love the blue wilderness stuff.
I feed my dogs only premium foods, but never used Blue Buffalo anyway due to two of my dogs being allergic to poultry. I don't think I ever saw a BB formula that did not include it, even the fish flavored ones, amazingly. Unfortunately, a lot of kibble that was formerly made without poultry is now starting to include chicken fat in their recipes - it must have gotten cheap in the last two years. I also look for foods which contain 25% or  more protein, and a few brands which once contained this much have lowered it in the past two years. There are a few Merrick recipes that are good, have high protein, and have a good price, but hate buying it since they are now owned by Nestle. 
Jesus, what? That's double the price Star Wars cost. I guess they have physical assets, to be fair. 
What does $8 billion look like in cash? Is that a boatload of $100 bills? 
I use to work in the same building as Blue Buffalo's HQ. They seemed so small so the 8 billion dollar price tag is really something. To put it into perspective, the net worth of the Cowboys and NY Yankees combined would be less. 
In cash? So like, rolling in wheelbarrows of dollars?
Stopped buying blue buffalo for my dog about 2 months ago when it seemed like their product got worse.. My suspicions were right, glad I switched to Core my dog loves it.
And that's the end of Blue Buffalo 
My dad just makes dog food for his dog now. You can see the effect that real food has on animals within a week. It actually costs about the same to buy meat in bulk and ground it yourself. He also adds all of the nutrients and whatnot to make sure the dog gets a nice healthy meal. 
definitely not worth that, some dirty money definitely being laundered here
Still not as bad as Clorox buying Burt's Bees
Please General Mills, don‚Äôt mess with the recipes of the foods. My puppy and cat love the dry food, wet food, & treats. Heck the only reason my puppy got used to her crate was because I gave her the Turkey & Salmon biscuits.  
how do you even transport $8 billion in cash? how do you hand it to the person? who has to count all of that?
>in cash

That's a lot of hund-o's.
Victor dog food... thank me later. My baby went from runny, nasty bowel movements to much much healthier stool after making the switch.  I wish I had known about it before I started giving it to my lab.

Oh ya, they are being sued for allegedly containing lead in the good. Google it. Stay away from  bb
Time to switch cat food brands.
How many trucks does it take to move $8 billion in cash?
   Sending the message that pet food is better than human food???
This will be the end of that brand. It will soon have the same lack of any nutritional content as their processed cereals do. Too bad

So does this mean that we are going to get bachelor chow now? 


Who better to make dog cereal than the brand that makes people cereal? I guess the food quality is that low and would be healthier for pets...
Well, there goes a good quality pet food brand. 
Well, time to find a new dog food brand... 
ok lots of dog food experts here? is royal canin good? my dog seems to be fine with it but i guess i want to know if theres better. 
‚ÄúSir the promise of cash is not an incentive‚Äù 
Merrick and Earthborn are great dog and cat foods. A little expensive, but well worth buying it. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs goes exactly with Earthborn, but if you send them your receipt they plant a tree!
And the conglomerates get fatter...
No one is going to want that shit anymore 
Well this is very disappointing. I have two huskies, one 12 years old and the other almost 2. Can anyone recommend a different, high quality dog food brand? 
In cash ? With $ 100 notes ?
General Mills makes dog food for humans, and Blue Buffalo makes cereal for dogs. Seems like a purge to match.
What's the shelf life on Blue Buffalo like?  I might need to stock up on a dozen bags or so while we try to find the next brand.

*presses F to pay respects*
Honestly this could only improve Blue Buffalo's quality. Blue Buffalo is garbage compared to actual quality pet food like Merrick or Orijen.
Welp.  Time to switch brands.  My dogs loved it while it lasted.

Also, no one buys jack squat with $8 billion in *cash*.  Do they even know how many semi trucks filled with the largest legal tender it would take to pay someone with 8 billion in cash?  What a moronic title.  Who's the editor over at CNBC?
Most commercial pet food is absolute garbage. If it isn't now, it will be within the next decade or so. 

Make your own pet food. Feed your pets a natural diet. Us folks over at /r/rawpetfood are more than willing to help you get started! Don't let your cat or dog fall victim to another toxic pet food outbreak! Take it into your own hands :) 
Second. It‚Äôs amazing. 
Wow that looks like a good brand. I'll bring up buying it in the next board meeting. 
Switched mine from Blue Buffalo to Fromm awhile ago. Also highly recommend. Blue Buffalo has too much protein for some dogs, which was the original reason for switching mine off. 
my dog loved fromm. and the change in his coat was awesome! i switched him to http://rawznaturalpetfood.com (sorry I don't know how to hyperlink) and it has been evem better from there.
Fromm though has had only one recall and it's because they put a little more protein in their canned line than they wanted to. Super trustworthy brand. It's a little expensive, but they eat less of it because its not puppy mcdonalds, so it works out
Somehow people still feed their dog shit, I hope they would find fromms but it seems they simply just don‚Äôt care
Not exactly the same price point. I'm seeing $30 Fromm 4 lb bags on Amazon. The Blue 11 lb bag is about $30.
I read about them and bought two pack. sadly my cat didn't like Fromm :( so i went with Nutrience
I think you and I may have been in the same meeting...
Welp, that's the last of Blue Buffalo I'll ever buy. Time to switch foods.
Well, giant congloms buy companies like we buy a roll of paper towels. 

You don't expect it to last forever, you're just going to use it until it's just a cardboard roll at the center, then get another one.
Thanks so much for not making the food scientist a chef
Can anyone suggest a good dry cat food? Comparable to what blue wilderness was?
> (pronounced Hay-sus)

I always preferred Hey Zeus just to further blaspheme 
Hay-sus? Are you kidding me?

It's HEY, ZEUS
Spent seven years leading R&D teams for a major global pet food company. Blue is a great product, not just great marketing. No way can Mills achieve the synergies I'm assuming they've used to justify the deal without turning Blue into every other mass-market brand. Think about IAMS pre- and post-P&G. 
[removed]
The unpleasant fate of any food.
If it hadn't it would have anyway. Any big brand goes into brand maintenance mode. Once you figure you can't grow sales significantly any more by making a better product you start to try to show growth by making your profits more cheaply.
It already wasn‚Äôt that great
What if it is the other way around? What if General Mills decided that Blue Buffalo dog food was better than the cereal they were producing. Maybe in 6 to 8 months we will all be eating better quality dog food instead of cereal.
Blue Buffalo has solid marketing, but is not a good product. The only food I found that works is science diet for my dogs and all the foster dogs that I have coming and going. 
It's about time these big companies start providing access to euthanasia drugs for the smaller distributors who can't afford to cannibalize pets themselves.
Fromm is an *amazing* company that I highly recommend that makes top-shelf cat food.
Same. Been switching between this and Merrick. Merrick is absolutely amazing. Will be going 100% Merrick now.
[deleted]
I do as well.  Funny thing though, I grew up with at least three cats as a kid, all of them outdoor cats, all of them were fed Meow Mix, all of them lived to at least 16 and we had to put them down when they developed arthritis so bad they meowed in pain.  Anyway, I would talk my parents into buying better cat foods but those darn cats would never eat them, instead they woudl typically run over to sniff the food, then fight!  Anyway, I'm sure Meow Mix is garbage, but not one of my cats ever got cancer or had digestion issues or anything and medically serious other than scratches and such when they fought with coons, dogs, coyotes.  I guess we were just fortunate.
Mine loves Wellness dry food.  
I switched from blue to Nutro MaxCat wet and Orijen Dry, my cats love it, it's similar if not better in quality and I can get a months worth for roughly the same amount.
[deleted]
Taste of the Wild is pretty decent as far as the research I've conducted  has gone for a higher end cat food with no grains, that is also very reasonable on a budget.  Can easily order it on Amazon.  The only minor downside is the manufacture Taste of Wild outsources production to in the US had a recall of some pet food at one of it's facilities in 2012, but there has only been a very small handful of pet foods that haven't had some sort of recall.
/r/rawpetfood
Look on dogfoodadvisor.com

Orijen, Honest Kitchen, Primal & Stella & Chewy's are good brands but a bit pricey. 

Taste of the Wild is more affordable & comparable in quality to Blue so I'd try that first.
If you use Chewy, try [American Journey](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/american-journey-grain-free-dog-food/). We were struggling to find an alternative after Orijen was taken off there but AJ has great ingredients.
one of my dogs stopped eating her blue so i went with taste of the wild. they ate that fine until they went to my friends house and ate merricks for a few days. they stopped eating TOTW so i switched to merricks. seems like a great food to me.
[Merrick](https://www.merrickpetcare.com/) has been an absolutely stellar alternative, and my pets love it much more than most of Blue Buffalo.
If they carry it near you Fromm is a good alternative. It‚Äôs made here in Wisconsin. It‚Äôs family owned and a great product. 
My dog likes Acana.

One thst doesn't get much love is Performatrin Ultra Grain free varities. They are up there with other 5 star foods. My dog is on Ocean Recipe. Makes his coat super soft and silky.
alternatives to feeding your dog a food that has caused tons of pet deaths? hmmm. have you tried chocolate?
Accept nothing less than USDA or organic meats in your prospective pet foods. If not USDA or organic, you're getting industrial waste. 
/r/rawpetfood
Other options that are of good quality:

Canidae Pure

Orijen

Fromm

Merrick

Wellness

I & Love & You

Instinct (don't buy the $90 bag that has 'raw bites' in it, it;s a rip off.  their kibble is high quality, but that doesn't mean the company isn't willing to stick it to you)

Solid Gold (actually a super high quality brand, and has trippy burnt out hippy packaging too)

Most if not all of those should be available from most pet stores.  
[removed]
Pay attention to brands that are comparable in price but don‚Äôt blow all of their money on advertising. 
Hill‚Äôs/Science Diet is a very good brand but I‚Äôve never seen a commercial. 
Taste of the Wild made by Diamond Pet. Co-manufacturer who has had recalls and also makes private label products that I'm sure you'd think are shit. I'm not knocking your choice, merely pointing out things are always what they seem. 
Orijen is awesome, I switched my cats to their Tundra dry and they love it.
IAMS is owned by Mars, Inc.

/r/rawpetfood
Taste of the wild?
https://www.diamondpet.com

Taste of the Wild is made by Diamond Pet. Diamond also manufactures some private label products. 
It's had several recalls, if I remember correctly. I wouldn't feed it to any of my animals (I don't, anyway, because it's a PETA thing).
The grain free is the best of the Ultra group. My dog is on Ocean Recipe.
Bought by Nestle/Purina in 2015 :(
Victor dog food. Manufactured in Texas
:/  

Orijen?   

May have to stockpile the Blue Wilderness we feed our pupper.   

Damn it.  We've had to switch our pup's food before, it was a fucking nightmare (diarrhea....diarrhea as far as the eye can see).
Fresh Pet. Mostly refrigerated food. Public company, but still small. Good quality ingredients. Focus on growth, not cutting back to save every penny. Not right for every owner or pet, but should be on the list of considerations. 
[Merrick](https://www.merrickpetcare.com/) 

Great company and top quality. 
My dog will only eat freeze dried food but if she'd eat kibble I'd feed her Taste of the Wild. It's comparable to Blue. You can usually find TOTW at small pet supply stores other than Petco or Petsmart and Tractor Supply Co. usually carries it as well.
Science Diet. 
There are a lot of good options, here are a few that should be available in most pet stores and will be of at least equal quality to blue buffalo:

Merrick

Fromm

Orijen

Instinct

I & Love & You

Wellness

Canidae Pure

They're all going to be at roughly similar price points (Instinct has a couple product lines that get stupid expensive and are a complete rip off.  Stay away from their 'raw bites' kibble, as it is entirely a marketing ploy to get you to spend way more money.  Their normal kibble is reasonably priced and good quality though).  Most of those companies make grain-free lines if you want to go that route.
Yeah, I have only had bad experiences with Blue Buffalo with my dogs and the foster dogs that I regularly coming and going.
I ran into problems with it and switched after a vet told me digestive distress problems she sees in the clinic keep pointing back to Blue Buffalo.
Switched mine from Core to B.B. Guess we cancelled out.
but when it arrives this is what will happen
[https://giphy.com/gifs/money-swimming-diving-n59dQcO9yaaaY](https://giphy.com/gifs/money-swimming-diving-n59dQcO9yaaaY)
Cash in this case refers to it being through currency that they have on hand, not specifically in physical money. This would be compared to purchasing it through an issuance of debt.
Not stock. Not debt. Cash means cash on the balance sheet. 
They're using it as a slang for dollars, as opposed to some sort of financing plan where they make multiple payments over time
Yeah, instead of feeding your pet toxins, feed them pathogenic bacteria out of a completely scientifically unsupported belief that it's healthier.

It‚Äôs also got bad ingredients 
Fair point although prices can vary from grain to grain free and from entry level to premium and from vendor to vendor on Amazon.

Wellness is a great brand for cats and dogs. And for cats Fancy Feast is pretty great for its price. The classic pates are grain free and have a higher protein to fat ratio than most high-end expensive brands do
You didn't think it was time to switch after all the recalls they had recently?
4 Health from tractor farm supply, four stars on dogfood advisor.
Try Purina proplan. My new pups stomach didn't always sit well with blue bufffalo and she recommended to try Purina pro plan (nothing to do with the upset stomach, just our vet recommended us to try it as that is what she used to feed her dogs) My pup likes the food even more and her stomach issues went away 
you kept buying it even after learning they we're basically using leather as filler in the food? ha. lucky dog you have.
You should‚Äôve swapped a long time ago.  It‚Äôs been tested and terrible for a while now
Blue Buffalo is actually a really terrible pet food. You should probably switch anyways. I‚Äôm a vet tech and most animals that come in and have food problems are on Blue Buffalo.

[deleted]
I feed my cats Wellness dry food.
Having spent 30+ years in corporate America CPG, including General Mills/Pillsbury, can confirm.  When saving $0.001/lb leads to millions in profits, bonus-hungry execs just can't help themselves, even if they know they'll kill the brand in a couple years.
Blue Buffalo wouldn't tell me the macro breakdown of their food (was researching for a potential CKD cat) because they thought the macro breakdown was "proprietary" so they can go change my diaper.
I feel like these acquisitions and quality downgrades are pretty standard affair. And there‚Äôs a typical half life for these products before they become the cheap knockoff. Doc Martens, Craftsman even Pyrex. 
We use Fromm ourselves.
Don't even have to look as far back as Iams. Innova, Natural Balance etc. etc.
Thanks for the comments, OP! This is all very interesting as I just switched my cats food to Blue and have been loving it. The only references I've seen in the thread are for dog food alternatives. What other cat food brands should I look at?
Huh.  Is that why Iams went to shit?  My cats used to eat it with no problem, then all of a sudden they'd puke it up.  Not all the time, but when you're dealing with cat barf, even once a week is too much.  
Horrible animal food companies is why for the past 3 years  i learned to cooking fresh food for my dogs. It went from a 12 older dog could barley walk and ready to die and did not want to eat kibble to now she loves her food with fresh shredded chicken, steamed sweet potato, carrots and simple vitamin supplement. Now she plays and loves her morning walks and is very happy. Staying away from processed foods for our animals is as important as it is for us humans.
I know two people who work at Blue. The execs were going to out of their way today to convince employees that it is NOT a merger. Blue will be run separately and the CEO will remain.

So in corporate speak that means it will be a couple of years until the current execs all leave and the cost cutting comes to fuck everything up.
The synergies? What are those? 
I‚Äôve done the same and blue is actually a very inconsistent shit product 
It's early and I can't think. Why would it not be a good idea?
In Soviet Vietnam, dog foods you!
A lot of the science diet varieties have corn/wheat meal as a top ingredient, but it's better than pretty much any Purina or IAMS or other 'average' dry food variety.
\>Blue Buffalo is not a good product

\>I use Science Diet

lmfao
Can you elaborate on why you think it‚Äôs not a good product?
[This science diet?](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/hills-science-diet-dog-food-adult-dry/) compared to [this blue buffalo?](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/blue-buffalo-dog-food-wilderness-dry/)

Science diet isn't a good food. It's better than shit like Ol Roy, but that means very little. What do you mean by "works?"
I tried to give my cat science diet.  Won't touch the stuff.  Won't go near it.

So I feed him Ziwi Peak dry food, usually lamb, and then he loves Instinct/Royal Canin. Mostly rabbit flavor though...  He loves his rabbit more than any other type of food I've ever tried to feed him.  Venison a close second.

The pet store by my parents house sells fromm so I get their tunachovy when I visit with me cat, but it's pricey. I don't know if it's the area or the food.
Thank you, I picked up Merrick cat food @ PetCo because the employee there highly recommended it but I'll check this out as well.
I just want to come back & tell you that I called a local pet supply food store & they had samples of Fromm & I'm going to try it out on my kitty tonight. Thank you!! 
I will second this.  I also live in Wisconsin where it is based and work for a company that makes process equipment for them.  They have very high standards, even at the engineering and design levels.  I have a very high confidence in their products. I feed it to both my dogs and cat.

After doing a lot of dog food research for my puppy I went with Fromm. Their company has a wonderful history and they don't mess around with their source ingredients. This is obviously anecdotal evidence, but three years later and she's the healthiest, trimmest dog that I've ever seen in person (she also gets absolutely zero table scraps).

Here's hoping they never sell to some huge megacorp.
Man, I liked Merrick but have to keep an eye on them as well. They were bought by Nestle Purina a few years ago. They still rate as top of the line quality but who knows for how long. 
It isn't just the name of ingredients that matter, it is the quality anf sourcing as well
Ya but usually when corporations take over privately owned brands, the quality depletes over time or something happens that's bad, like cats or dogs get sick in some way. I just don't want the quality standards of a corporation when privately owned brands have something to lose if the quality isn't up to par. Also, knowing that corporations always take the cheapest route for their own self interests, I'd rather not support that & risk my cat's health even if the ingredients are the same. Eventually they won't be. 
If they were outdoor cats, they were likely killing mice and birds which would give them a better natural diet. 
Same here, but 2 cats
Fed Wellness dry to our dog. He loved it. And it's a great product by a great company. 
Lol Orijen and Blue are not similar in quality. At all.  Orijen is near the top and blue hovers below the midline. Orijen uses all organ meats and veggies/fruit to meet nutrient requirements where blue uses a standard synthetic  nutrient pack.
Thank you! 
We've been happy with Taste of the Wild for several years now. 
ToW recently (last spring) had a large salmonella and mold outbreak in their foods. They refused to recall and dozens of pets dies and thousands got sick. Would not support Diamond pet foods
Fromm.   https://frommfamily.com/
+1 for Taste of the Wild. Reasonably priced and protein based formula, been feeding my dog TotW for 2 years and he loves it.
Just so you know, dogfoodadvisor is not a reliable source of information for pet food. The website is run by a human dentist and their parameters for judging food are based on flawed criteria.
My two cents on dogfoodadvisor. The site is owned by a dental surgeon. He has a vet that helps him, but it seems like a bigger factor than nutrition in his ratings is foods having "controversial ingredients". 

Despite what a lot of people might think, big food companies do tons of research on animal nutrition, and that information is legally required to be given to anyone who asks. Big companies don't automatically make worse food. People assume that "filler" ingredients are a waste of space or bad for their animal. They may be cheaper for the company to produce with, but everything in them is going to be nutritionally beneficial.

Yeah, god forbid you drive to a local store to buy your food. Orjien pulled off chewy.com because they were bought by petsmart
Victor is a good alternative,  too.
Unfortunately they got bought out as well. Expect their quality to die.
Pretty sure Merrick was bought by Nestle/Purina a couple years ago and I assumed the quality was going to take the same dive as BB will with this recent acquisition. It's pretty standard practice for larger/cheaper brands to buy out competitors.
Merrick's feedlot in Hereford, Texas dumps waste right in to a creek that flows in to Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge.

[Their quality isn't close to current Blue Buffalo unfortunately.](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/natures-recipe-dry/)
Not really feasible for people with larger dogs, or even medium sized dogs for that matter.
Diamond has had one recall in 2012, and it was a voluntary one.  None of the tested Taste of Wild recalled pet food tested positive for salmonella.  Big companies make dozens of different products under private labels all the time.  And virtually every pet food manufacturer has had a recall or two.

Yeah, they might make some crap supermarket food or something, but they aren't just mixing ingredients/formulas up when they make the food.  And most of their ingredients for pet food comes from the US according to this https://www.petful.com/downloadnow/food-repor.pdf
Their treats are good too. I'm just picky about what my cat eats after that whole melamine issue as some pet food companies were using ingredients from China. My aunt lost one of her dogs because of tainted dog food. 
Yeah in a few months I'll get one more BIG dry food bag and a few cans of wet in the mean time (there's honestly so many good options now that this isn't a huge loss), but I'll have to research a new good dry option. 
Yep. I guess I have Jack London on my mind. 
I did a search for them and the first thing that came up was a recall of their product.  
PETA's behind Blue Buffalo? That organization has way to many black marks on it's history as it is.

I prefer WWF. 
I think Nestle only handles the distribution, they have no say what goes in the actual food.
I know Nestle/Purina bought them -- but I must admit. I use to buy Merrick before the sale (its made right here in my town), but found the quality control was poor. Like, cans of cat food would be GREAT, but other cans of the same kind would have almost no meat and all gravy. I recently bought some of the "new" Merrick and it seems like the quality has actually improved. My cats love it, too, so that's a plus.
Champion has both Orijen and Acana brands.  Acana has a lower calorie offering than Orijen if you dog is a bit overweight.
I just bought my first bag of blue wilderness now that my pup turned 1 and was super pumped about it lol. Fuck me I suppose.
Do you transition slowly? I‚Äôve never had an issue as long as I‚Äôm introducing it with their current food and swapping the ratio over a few days. 
Merrick is owned by Nestle. :(
Diamond Pet foods is a terrible company
[deleted]
Yup exactly why I dropped it, my dog went from pooping a solid twice a day to like 7 and struggling each time.
It‚Äôs cash because BUFF shareholders are receiving cash. General Mills doesn‚Äôt have anywhere close to $8bn of cash on hand and it looks like they will finance the transaction through a mix of debt and an equity raise.
lmao are you arguing that raw meat is bad for pets?

Forgot my cats and dogs evolved from tigers and wolves, which are well known for cooking their meat over campfires. 
My pets like it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
I think I'm going to go for Wellness Core based on [this](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/).
Doesn't want to work on mobile. What did the deleted comment say? 
Wellness is an excellent food. My senior German shepherd started turning his nose up at it though, so now I feed Earthborn. I was still feeding one of the biscuits but I'll have to switch that now.
Fancy Feast is also owned by a large corporation that has been found to be using slave labor. It's owned by Nestle and Nestle is the devil https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Purina_PetCare
I check and it wasn't for anything I use. My old man is pretty picky but I guess he'll just have to suck it up now.
4 health is made by diamond pet foods and they have been having issues as well. I would switch. Ingredients list is great but how they source and manufacture is iffy. 
how much more it cost?
You might want to rethink anything by Purina. I had to search to find anything besides flashy ads for how good their food is. You want to see meat meal, such as chicken, rather than whole meat as once you get the water out, there isn't as much content there.

Anyway here is the ingredients for [ Savor chicken & rice](https://www.proplan.com/dogs/products/savor-puppy-shredded-blend-chicken-rice-formula#ingredientsandguaranteedanalysis)

Ingredients include by-product meal that can come from any dead animal and ever contain feathers. Corn anything, is a filler and many dogs are allergic to it. They also can't digest corn. So even saying chicken & rice, they pad it out with cheap ingredients.
Chicken, brewers rice, poultry by-product meal (source of glucosamine), corn gluten meal, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), soybean meal, whole grain wheat, whole grain corn, corn germ meal, dried egg product, animal digest, brewers dried yeast, glycerin, fish meal (source of glucosamine), fish oil, calcium carbonate, salt, mono and dicalcium phosphate, potassium chloride, choline chloride, zinc proteinate, Vitamin E supplement, manganese proteinate, ferrous sulfate, sulfur, niacin, copper proteinate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, Vitamin D-3 supplement, calcium iodate, biotin, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), and sodium selenite

Shit, I didn't hear about that.  Though given the fact that they're more heavily marketed than they used to be I'm not surprised.  So, what's a good, reasonably priced dry dog food?
they are still one of the few that doesnt use corn etc. My gf's cat can only eat blue buffalo and a few others
Dogs can eat cardboard and be healthier than any human I know 
Nope, been feeding Earthborn for several years now but my dog likes one of the Blue Buff biscuits. So I'll stop feeding that. My dogs are always rescues in poor condition when they come in so they get the best. Don't worry, if anything they are a bit too "healthy." :)
Actually I feed Earthborne but my dog likes one of the biscuits. I'll have to switch her over now.
I feed Earthborn but my girl likes some of the biscuits.
Because "corporate personhood" is not the same as "corporations are people." Corporate personhood is the concept you want to look up and newsflash, it's been around since the 1700s
If that's really true, do you think that General Mills won't decrease the quality of the product? If they do decrease the quality of the product but still expect owning the brand to be worth 8 billion dollars, do you accept this as evidence that you're wrong?
My tenure so far is only 15 years, but spent in the same spaces as you (CPG, Food), and it's very true. The companies justify it by making a series of one degree shifts over the months, and each time say, "Yeah, but it's such a small change." What a consumer sees, however, is the huge departure from where it all started. 
The trick is that when you acquire a brand and drive it into the ground, the people buying the brand are almost always retards that allow you to utterly ruin it before they actually notice they're being cheated and deny you their business. In the meantime you've made back your investment plus a tidy sum, and your products occupy more space on shelves.
Costco has decent dog food.
^^ It's the same problem that affects heads of state. If I'm going to be gone in 4 years anyway, I can just make it look like we're doing great while I'm killing our long term profitability. The next guy will look like he's doing a shitty job, not me. 
[deleted]
Found Tom Segura's Reddit account. 
Everyone is worried that the dog food will drop in quality. I'm here waiting for them to introduce a new line of breakfast cereal that tastes strangely meaty or that I'll suddenly start seeing poultry by-product meal listed as an ingredient in Lucky Charms. 
[deleted]
wait what happened to docs, i was thinking about replacing my old pair 
Kinda makes a case for having cheap Chinese knockoffs readily available. It lessens the chance one of the better brands will get captured if there's already an approximate cheap version available. Why make a shittier Pepsi if there's already a Bepis?
Synergies is a general term I've heard and I used to refer to the efficiencies gained by combining to corporations. For example, you don't need two CEO's or two complete HR departments, and suppliers often give better prices when buying larger quantities, and retailers are more lenient with brand owners who have more to offer. Hope that helps.

Science Diet and Royal Canin, to name two, are formulated 100% for the animal with very little regard for trendy marketing. Meaning it's 100% possible to deliver a high-quality product with everything your pet needs without making it from ground up steaks and chicken breasts.  
That's what I ended up with after much trial and error. Whatever ends up working is what I'll go with. Blue Buffalo has too much litigation associated with it.
Blue Buffalo caused soft stool along with other food. Sensitive stomach Science Diet firm all that up.
[deleted]
Remember the good old days when Ol Roy was made from American sawdust and not the cheap Chinese sawdust?  Talk about a drop in quality!
Just curious if you are aware of this: https://www.petfoodsettlement.com/


Well, either there is [false advertising with Blue Buffalo](http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/purina-blue-buffalo-settle-false-advertising-lawsuit/article_6ecf86d3-7dcb-5fac-8f2a-724b2ddc4363.html) or Dog Food Advisor is like the credit agencies leading up to the 2008 crash.  

Then there is this [class action lawsuit](http://www.dogingtonpost.com/class-action-lawsuit-blue-buffalo-lead/) against Blue Buffalo where people received [checks](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/831324-blue-buffalo-pet-food-ingredients-class-action-settlement-checks-mailed/) this year.  

I guess Dog Food Advisor is woefully uninformed or is to dog manufacturers that the NRA is to gun manufacturers. 


Merrick is also great!
Ah... Good to know. I just read that they ONLY handle distribution, and have no part in the manufacturer, supply line, etc. But that is still good info to have.
Ughhh I just picked a bag up of this as well! This is disappointing, I hate Nestl√©. I buy nothing of theirs because I hate the corporation's practices. Guess I have to pick up something different. Thank you for pointing that out, they have their hands in everything.

Blue Buffalo has been shareholder-owned now for quite some time.

We have both of our dogs on ToTW and they really like it. Haven't tried many brands however since I'm worried about digestive issues while switching. Will say my rescue was on IAMS (former owner had her on it) before switching her to ToTW and she stopped eating dog poop within the day. Her fur also got a lot softer
There's a feed store near here that carries it, that could work out well. Danke.
This is the thing people miss when comparing small vs large companies. Everyone assume big companies are full of cigar-smoking, combed-back haired white men in their 60's who don't care about the consumer. Well, guess what, those companies are also the ones with SQF certification, FSMA compliance, and the money to employ Food Safety and Quality Assurance teams. 
Years ago my dog got salmonella from another tainted batch of TotW food. Looks like they're still having issues. Haven't had any problems with BB, so I'll probably stick with them for the time being.
I can't really find any information on that at all besides on a pro-make your own pet food website.  Diamond Pet Manufacturing or whatever it is called has to legally follow up on those issues, and if they didn't issue a voluntary recall, and the FDA didn't order a mandatory one, there wasn't an issue they could find with the food made.  I'm guessing you read that off of some newsblog or some such.
What is the pricing of Fromm compared to blue buffalo and Origen?  And where is it available?  I‚Äôm interested in trying it out for my two cats.  
Terrible sourcing standards though.  Also if a company cared about actual quality product, ToW wouldn't be their premium line with dozens of other lines that are comparable to ol roy and pedigree
'Nutritionally beneficial' is a pretty vague term with a lot of wiggle room, though.

A grain-heavy dog food is 'nutritionally beneficial' in that it will sate your dog and provide nutrients, but it's also FAR from an ideal choice if your concern is maximizing the longevity of your dog's life and minimizing the risk of health complications down the road.

Do some cost-saving fillers fit 1:1 with a higher cost ingredient that they're replacing and exhibit no other tangible changes in the quality of nutrition or potential unwanted side effects?  Maybe, but there are far more that do represent a compromise in quality, and consumers are right to be dubious when a parent company looking to cut costs starts to make the claim that a cheaper filler is nutritionally indistinguishable and that the creator of the original formulation was either oblivious or unjustified in their decision to avoid it.  I would imagine the demographic seeking Blue Buffalo and its equivalents aren't willing to make any compromises whatsoever, though.

Source:  Am also dating someone who works in the vet industry.
That..  is not a good way to judge the quality of the food.  Harder poops usually mean lower quality food
it could be the protein source instead of the brand sometimes :)
I buy online because back problems make it hard to lug the big bags out to my car (at home I use a dolly). I loved Orijen for my dog, but had to switch after they pulled from Amazon and Chewy.
Really?! I just switched to merricks :( 
Yes, but for Nestle Purina, Merrick is part of a wide portfolio of brands, product types, price levels, etc., and, while I'm not speaking first-hand, Purina is likely to leave Merrick as-is so they have an offering for that consumer segment while limiting the cost-savings opportunities to manufacturing and supply chain (e.g. better trucking rates due to Nestle scale, larger factories running more efficiently).  
[deleted]
I think Diamond is totally fine. Merely pointing out to previous commenter that TotW and Orijen are not so similar. 
Try Merrick's dry, or Solid Gold's. I also feed Natural Balance kibble and my cats have been healthy and happy.
Taste of the wild uses high quality ingredients, but their manufacturing process seems suspect.  There are a disturbingly large number of dogs having severe adverse reactions to taste of the wild, even after eating it for years.  
I've been feeding Fromm for several years, with raw as a supplement.

Trying to think--what's WWF? I'm coming up blank LOL
It's possible, being owned by Purina is enough for me to change brands though
oh honey
>if you dog is a bit overweight.  

Nah, she's a lean 80 pound Berner.  She was starting to gain weight (her high point was 84), but miraculously starting losing weight as my wife and I went lo carb.  Lol.  

The vet was a little worried that the dog lost 8 pounds in a year until we told her about our diet change.  Haha.
You're still good, they won't change anything right away. Plus all the dog food in stores right now is guaranteed to be the old stuff, I'm gonna stock up while I know the food isn't poison and look into alternatives
yeah.  It took a couple of weeks
I have a 6 yr. old ornery shih tzu with gnarly teeth that won't eat any kibble. She'll only eat freeze dried food or home cooked food. If I try to feed her anything else she goes on hunger strike which results in her throwing up bile from getting acid reflux. It's just easier for me to give in to the little terrorist.
It's significantly riskier than cooked meats which they are perfectly capable of digesting. Not to mention it spreads dangerous bacteria which colonize the pets into the environment through their feces, which can then find their way into other animals and children
Looks like a great choice.  Thanks for sharing that site as well.  It looks pretty comprehensive.
Well animals are no different than humans, they need variety too. It‚Äôs not a bad idea to change your pet food up every month or so
My dog doesn't do "switch" too well, her colon is remarkably unstable. Who do you recommend? My pooch gets a slice of freshpet with every meal as well. 
interesting, I'll have to do some more research and bring it up with our vet. We have been using proplans puppy formula that our vet recommended after we told her she was having some digestive issues with blue buffalo. It's about time to switch my pup to adult food soon so I'll bring it up at the next vet visit. 
I don't because it makes him puke bile. 

Edit: I was replying to a comment about rawhide. My dog pukes bile after eating rawhides.
Taste of the Wild is supposed to be a pretty good food for a reasonable price. 

If you are willing to spend more Orijen and Acana are supposed to be awesome. I have heard they have had trouble with their new us plant though, so you would want to buy the ones made in Canada.

Pet food allows lots of leeway for fuckery. Nothing simpler than shoveling trash to pets. 
And then they move on and buy up the next good product line, rinse and repeat. Disgustingly effective at making money.
Can confirm! Blue, while a great food (for now) can be very rich to some dogs. I used royal canin for a couple years but the most recent bag made my dog vomit every time he ate some. Very strange and my vet said there was probably something wrong with the food although I could barely get the company comment. Finally decided to give Costco a try and it's the best food my dogs had ever! Plus the price is great. Since switching I've heard a number of breaders recommend it too.
Diamond pet foods are far from "decent"

\*facepalm* now I *know* I'm not awake. I was reading Vietnam and my mind was saying South Korea.
No calorie conversion. Industry-speak for what you described; pet owners feed scraps and human food vs buying manufactured food. The markets aren't yet evolved to the same degree as NA, Europe, Japan. Pets are important, and population/ ownership is growing, but they aren't yet "family members" the way they have become in "Western"'cultures. 
Maybe I'm missing a reference to the Vietnam war or something but what does communism have to do with the rest of this?  Are poor people in "communist" Vietnam less able to buy it than the poor in Liberia?

It's a weird remark without (or with?) context
Don't talk bad about communism, Reddit loves it. :(
>Blue Buffalo caused soft stool along with other food  

Eh?  Ours eats Blue Wilderness, and she has small poops.  Especially for an 80 pound dog.
Organic is just a marketing term at this point. I wouldn't use it as a measure of quality.
Every meat on earth is organic. This guy doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about so disregard him. 
You mean the ingredient list that mentions containing multiple chicken products?
Ya it is, the ingredients are sound but someone also pointed out they're owned by Nestl√© :/ I'm going to try out Fromm like someone else said because the local pet supply store by me has samples!
Yes, but for Nestle Purina, Merrick is part of a wide portfolio of brands, product types, price levels, etc., and, while I'm not speaking first-hand, Purina is likely to leave Merrick as-is so they have an offering for that consumer segment while limiting the cost-savings opportunities to manufacturing and supply chain (e.g. better trucking rates due to Nestle scale, larger factories running more efficiently). Having been in this space for quite a while, and knowing these companies, I would be very surprised to see Nestle make changes to the Merrick line-up. 
Orijen/Acana
Canidae's Pure product line is a good option.
McDonalds meat vs. Meat from a local butcher.  Which one is quality
Quality in pet food, as someone with experience in that industry, typically refers to food safety followed by quality of ingredients.

Food safety is pretty simple. Is the food cooked thoroughly so as to stop microbial growth. Is the food handled safely to prevent re contamination of the cooked food. And, are there any foreign materials in the ingredients. For example, did a machine break and shred a piece of metal into the mixing equipment (extreme example). 

Ingredient quality if more subjective. Does the recipe use human grade meat, by products, grains, synthetic preservatives?

Food safety is an absolute. Ingredient quality is a bit more up for debate based on personal opinions and pet preference. 
For example a bunch of dogs and cats were killed by low quality wheat from China a few years ago. They had added a chemical so that it tested as having a higher level of protein (a sign of higher quality wheat that gets a higher price). The chemical is poisonous to dogs and cats however. That‚Äôs why quality and sourcing is important. 
So meat meals, for example, come in a variety grades based on the source of the meal.  High grade meals start off as normal cuts of meat.  That is, a high grade chicken meal is going to be dried and ground up chicken breasts/thighs.  Low grade meals are a way for a processor to squeeze some value out of non-marketable cuts.  So a low grade meal is going to be all the trimmings from the butchering process, which are then dried and ground up.

So, to recap: High grade meals take good cuts and grind them up.
Low grade meals take scraps and byproduct and grind them up.  

This impacts the nutrient profile of the meal.  


I've seen too many articles where pet food owned by large corporations have made pets sick. I'm not going to take the time to make the effort you could do in researching that subject. Sorry but I am @ work for 12 hours today & don't have the time to delve deeper than that bullshit reason lol & they could lose quality by the source of the ingredients or missed quality standards that would have otherwise been caught by a smaller scale company. I just find more mistakes happen en mass with corporations than any small business. Also supporting companies who cut corners or change things eventually, which they almost always do, doesn't sit well with me. Regardless, I'm not risking it. 
>> if the ingredients are the same  

> If that is true, how would they theoretically lose quality?  

Just because two raw materials have the same name does not mean they are identical.  Manufacturers can produce the "same" materials using different methods that produce different byproducts and qualities, and will almost certainly have different quality standards and acceptable limits for said products.  This leads to very not-insignificant differences between most raw materials that go into a given product, including pet food.  

Now imagine you've got an executive pushing for cost savings, a purchaser finds cheaper feedstocks, and the raw materials are swapped.  Same ingredient list, different end product.  In some cases it won't matter, but in others it does.  
I can also highly recommend Taste of the Wild. Good ingredients, good options in flavors, solid availability near me. Big, big fan. Been feeding it for 5 years almost now.
Totw is made by diamond and they are pretty big. They make Kirkland, 4health, Diamond and private label too. They got too big too fast  is the problem. Cutting corners left and right. So many variables when it comes to manufacturing pet food.
You guessed wrong.  I work in the pet food industry, and personally spoke with almost a hundred people whose dogs became sick. ToW should have been recalled last year and was not yet many dogs became very ill. Independent testing showed positive for mold and salmonella. I know of two cats that died and their vets said it was the food. I'm not getting info from blogs, its what I have personally seen and experienced.  

Something tells me it isn't impossible for a muliti billion dollsr corp to weasel out of a forced recall. Recalls hurt business and ToW is their bread and butter. When this was going on, the Diamond legal team was handing out papers to pet stores about how to discuss the issues experienced with their food. 

They knew there was an issue, and should have issued a recall, but chose to make money over saving lives. 

It is comparable in price.   We feed our cat the grain free varieties.   Not sure on availability, depends on the store and distribution in your area.   I only go to an independently owned pet store, sorry!
I understand.  That is unfortunate but they pulled off for good reason. Perhaps there is a local delivery service? Or a local store that will help you out
Merricks is still a good food, at least for now. I've found the consistency of quality has actually gone UP since their acquisition.
i stick to new zealand brands. zealandia and addictions :) 
i still buy merricks so im not saying its terrible, but before they were bought, my friend would buy their wet food. it had real carrots, veggies, and meats in the can. after nestle bought them it turned into mush. so it has changed a little, but how much i do not know.
I'm not really a fan of any of the Purina brands so while it's possible I still wouldn't choose to support them over other brands
That is not how it has happened in the past, why do you think this will be different with nestle?
The difference between a 3 and 4.5 star food is pretty big. The ingredients in a 3 star food are pretty trash.
World Wide Fund for Nature

PETA has a long standing creed that they want to irradiate domesticated animals and generally go about things in the worst way. Every few years there's usually a story about PETA killing neighborhood pets and throwing them in dumpsters. PETA is horrible. 
What's wrong with Purina?
Yeah true true. Although I am not necessarily in the financial situation to bulk buy dog food at the moment. Am I looking in the wrong place or is Orijen really 82 bucks for a 25 lb bag? 
My shi tzu is the same exact way, I feed her TOTW and 70% of the time she won't eat it dry and she'll go all day without eating and will vomit bile. What I do is either I moisten it up with warm water, or I just throw some carrots or another veggie in a blender and make it into a puree and mix it with her food and she eats all of it.
Cooked meat significantly degrades the nutritional value of the food. Dog/cat digestive tracts are designed to handle these bacteria. The argument that dog poop/cat poop will be dangerous is stupid - keep your moron kids away from animal shit. 

Also, have been feeding my cats raw for over a year and so far, according to their vet: their coats are better, teeth are cleaner, eyes are brighter, weight is better, blood sugar levels are better, etc. etc. etc. 

Unless you have an animal with severe medical issues that impacts their immune system, there‚Äôs virtually zero risk to feeding your animals human-quality, properly stored raw meat.
Sorry wall of text but dog food was my life for like 8 years. But My doggy is the same! She poops blood from food sensitivities. I feed Acana, and I used to feed it‚Äôs bigger and more expensive brother, Orijen. Acana is about $40-60 per 13lb but a 13 lb bag of the ‚Äúfreshwater fish‚Äù is at  the low end of 38 bucks but lasts my 60lb dog about 3-4 weeks. Made with lots of meat and lentils, she only needs 3/4c a feeding. She 7 and not fully active for reference.
For some background, I sold multiple brands of dog food at a small local store for years and have been to multiple trade shows,  pet food facilities, and always come back to Orijen/Acana (Champion Pet Foods) which is made in Canada and they just got a new place in Kentucky. Great manufacturing processes and sourcing local ingredients. And If those prices are too high the next level I recommend is 

Zignature(made at pets global plant in Wisconsin. been there, great place!)

Earthborn (made in Evansville IN, been there too. Local sources and family owned) 

Fromm (Family owned since 1904 and made in Wisconsin, haven‚Äôt been but heard it is lovely) 

There‚Äôs so many dog foods out there now and everyone seems like an expert. I‚Äôm not a vet but most vets do not learn about food. That‚Äôs what nutritionists are for. Just hills and Royal Canin are the only two I see getting  recommended by vets. Expensive and usually minimal ingredients to keep the system calm. Good for short term but pretty bland in my opinion. 


Lastly! Sorry...it‚Äôs almost over. When switching just match the first 3 or 4 ingredients to what your dog is eating now and follow a 10 day transition period.  When you completely change the protein source and the type of carbohydrates, then that‚Äôs usually the problem. The stomach isn‚Äôt prepared with the correct enzymes to break down the food so it just says ‚Äúfuck this, let‚Äôs just diarrhea our way out of this situation‚Äù 
In my experience vets don't know much about dog foods. They tend to get literature from the companies and don't have the time to do research unless they do it for their own dog. It's pretty easy to do your own research as a ton more info is available on line now. You want meat meal (of some type) as the main ingredient with maybe whole meat second and no grains as dogs can be allergic to corn and wheat. And absolutely NO by-products! Always be suspicious of any food that doesn't have a link easily available to ingredients. [Dog Food Advisor](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com) is a good resource simply because ingredients and a discussion of those ingredients are clearly posted. You can also sign up for recalls and alerts. Have fun learning about canine nutrition. Your dog will thank you for it.
I've heard good things about Orijen.  I received a sample at a local dog supply store.  While Blue Buffalo was pretty expensive at ~$50 for 24 pounds, Orijen is nearly $90 for 25 pounds.  I have 2 dogs, so that would be a significant increase in cost.

I care what my dogs consume, but a buddy of mine's vet told him to stop buying expensive shit and just go with Science Diet.  It makes me feel like I'm some Whole Foods helicopter parent when I drop that kind of cash on an animal that happily eats its own shit.
For a moment I thought your dog was a female.
Yeah, I don't see that happening.
That person is making an obvious joke lol 
In 2012, a presidential candidate, who certainly had the business experience to know better used the exact phrase "corporations are people."
That's EA's business model for making games.
I had no clue this could happen, but i think this might be happening to my cat(s). They love the salmon cat foods and nobody has quality ingredients except the blue buffalo wilderness. The cats love it, but every once in a while id find a little pile of throw up.

Since I'll be switching their food now either way, I'll look into one of these other companies



Blue is too inconsistent to be good. It‚Äôs been shit for about 5 years 
We switched from Blue to grain free wegmans dog food. 33 bucks for a 36 pound bag. We go through two bags a month.
Don't leave those of us in the dark hanging...better or worse than "decent?" I've never bought pet food from Costco. 
[deleted]
Yeah! Everything is supposed to go to shit!
It's not about the products. It's about the parent companies that buy the companies that make products and then devalue the product while charging the same for it as before if not more, siphoning the difference in value.
[‚ÄúVariety‚Äù](https://imgur.com/a/Qdv6I) 
Yeah it‚Äôs a good thing we have 100 different ways we can buy the same toothpaste. 
So what did you find to be the best? Our cat is on the early part of the last stages unfortunately. She's begun to develop oral dysphagea so soft/wet food is needed. She also has had a tendency to throw up on certain foods so it can be tough.
It‚Äôs no longer made of borosilicate glass.  It will shatter more easily from quick temperature changes (I.e. adding cold water to a hot glass pan) and is much less drop resistant.  
There are whole subcultures devoted to old cookware because most of the new stuff is shit. There are people that regularly haunt Goodwills and such trying to find it and sell it on ebay for a massive markup. My Ekco sauce pan that I got for for $4 at Goodwill 30 years ago still sells for $20 on ebay. 
[deleted]
The labware is the borosilicate glass. Can't tell you how many times I've abused those poor beakers but they've held up.
Every dog is different. I have encountered mostly liquid stools with my 2 dogs and around 10 fosters in the last 2.5 years. The reason with the fosters is that they were on Blue Buffalo, then I transitioned them off.
[Organic foods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food) definition

If the pet food doesn't claim USDA or organic, then its industrial waste, trash that would disgust and appalling you, almost certainly. 

It's a sad, simple truth of the feed industry. 
This is good to know. I once worked a low-level job at a pretty infamous standalone company that was absorbed by it‚Äôs huge nationwide competitor. The stores were completely opposite in ideals but we were still given a decent amount of leeway in running the old way.  
I'm glad to hear this. I use Merrick and it's been great for my dog. 
> Yes, but for Nestle Purina, Merrick is part of a wide portfolio of brands, product types, price levels, etc., and, while I'm not speaking first-hand, Purina is likely to leave Merrick as-is so they have an offering for that consumer segment while limiting the cost-savings opportunities to manufacturing and supply chain (e.g. better trucking rates due to Nestle scale, larger factories running more efficiently). Having been in this space for quite a while, and knowing these companies, I would be very surprised to see Nestle make changes to the Merrick line-up.

They already did though.  On some of their products, they started to use more meals instead of whole meats.  That is, all their products used to list a whole meat as the first ingredient.  After the Nestle acquisition, several products began to list a meat meal as the first ingredient.  

source - worked as the dog/cat department manager at a large national-chain pet store, and remember this happening. 
Thank you! 
both are better than dog food

[deleted]
Thats good to know! I switched my puppy from blue buffalo wilderness because I noticed all the vitamin levels and it seemed like way better food for not much more money than bb.
I feed my dog their kibble and wet food and the wet food still has real veggies in it. I‚Äôve seen carrots as well as other veggies that I can‚Äôt recall at the moment. The meat are big chunks too, not the pur√©e you get in a lot of other brands. The consistency isn‚Äôt perfect, so sometimes we‚Äôll get a can that‚Äôs not as full as usual or has more gravy than normal, but like 95% of the time it‚Äôs full of good-looking stuff so I can forgive the odd can here and there. And my dog goes nuts for it so that‚Äôs good too lol.

I have to admit that I am a bit turned off now that I know who owns them though, but that‚Äôs solely for my own human reasons and nothing to do with what the food does my for dog.
Did you ever notice that before the acquisition, the wet food lacked a consistency of quality? I did. I'd buy a case of say, Cowboy Cookout and most of the cans were super great, but there would always be a couple that had no meat and all gravy!!! I've recently bought some again and find the consistency of quality greatly improved
That I can't disagree with. 
Just one guys opinion who knows the space and these products fairly well. 
[deleted]
I've been fighting against PETA for 30 years. They are a terrorist group. (LOL I'm fully aware of all this.)

For those who aren't aware (not Valentinee):
PETA wants *no one* to have pets‚Äîthey truly believe that death is better than human ownership. Their money *does not* go to helping animals. They're the ones who started the whole "all breeders are evil" thing, which is simply not true. Their motto is "better dead than bred". They employ marketing geniuses‚ÄîI've got to hand it to them on that account‚Äî& they have a LOT of money to spend on it. Ingrid Newkirk is nasty beyond belief.

HSUS is in bed with them. That's why you often hear that you should support your *local* Humane Societies. Wayne Pacelle, who's recently stepped down because of sexual harassment allegations, is right up there with Newkirk.
I'd recommend the movie Pet Fooled, it's on Netflix
It's a mediocre food that you're paying more for than other good foods. See [Dog Food Advisor](https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com) to find better foods 
Yep. It's supposed to be the holy grail of dog foods, the same company makes one that has slightly less protein, search Acana dog food. A little bit cheaper but still not cheap by any means, premium dog food is expensive!
Please don't apologize for taking the time to write me a thoughtful complete answer, thank you. I've never had bleeding issues (9 yr old Australian shepherd) but the diarrhea issues sometimes come and go. The only thing that fixes that is antibiotics. I think I tried the Earthborn once and she didn't like it. She is a beef or chicken dog, hates the fish. I used to like to give her some merrick thanksgiving dinner but since the colon issues I keep the diet strict. I will tell you this the worst product was when my mom insisted she be allowed to have some nutrish because of Rachel Ray. I gave it away and the guy who I gave it to ended up throwing it out it made his dog sick too. 
"Food so good, they'll eat it twice"
The vet likely said to use that because they get paid to push it. My vet carries that same brand. Not saying it‚Äôs not a bad brand though. 
You'd be surprised or maybe not.
Diamond is top of the line
[deleted]
[deleted]
I'm so sorry to hear that, do you have them on prescription food like k/d?
> is much less drop resistant

I didn't realize there had been a change until I dropped one of my newer Pyrex bowls about 2 inches above my counter top. It exploded into hundreds of tiny shards. I've dropped some of my older Pyrex stuff that far plenty of times without that happening. It's really disappointing.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Goodwill price vs. Ebay price for literally anything is like this.
[deleted]
And it is also pretty thick glass (1000 ml beaker)
Organic means nothing. 
Well. Here's a dirty secret. Small companies with small distribution and small regulatory departments often label things as meat when a larger company like Purina, Mars, Smucker's would not risk the FTC crackdown and so ingredients don't change but post-acquisition the ingredient decks do change to reduce legal risk. 

Source - Have been a part of fixing ingredient lists of products acquired from "mom and pop" companies. 
> That's the problem I have with the statement. Most of these are safe so then it's just the highly debatable "quality" part.

Well, no, it's not.  Low quality meat meals, for example, are going to have a higher amount of byproduct used.  This raises the ash content  of the meal.  A high quality meal is going to use more actual meat, and so have a lower ash content.

The quality of the meal directly impacts the quality of nutrition.  

UNfortunately, there are no labelling requirements as to the grade of meat meal used.  So, unless the company goes out of their way to make it known, you have no way to know whether the meal used is primarily meat-based or if it contains a lot of trim and byproduct.  
No I don't have the time to put in the effort you, as a lazy person don't want to do yourself. I clearly have done my research prior to you responding, in order to form the stance I have otherwise I wouldn't believe what I do. Unless you yourself have some data to counter my claims, this is redundant. Like I said, I absolutely, 100% positively will not risk it so I don't know what you're doing here besides trying to be argumentative over something preference-wise that I as a consumer have the right to. I don't support large scale corporations if I can help it because from my perspective they make more mistakes because of the large quantities they produce. It isn't rocket science, avoiding that point would be naive.
I feed mostly raw, so it's all fairly local but I do usually buy a bag of kibble in case I'm too lazy. I'm lucky to live really close to Champion Pet Foods who make the Orijen and Acana brands so I usually stick with them. More expensive but no grain, GMO and very high quality.
Yes, but why? Large corporations have a long running habit of buying pet food companies with the promise of maintaining quality standards, and the food goes to shit in a few years.  Why will this be any different than the past?
Because it's the only source that actually looks at all ingredients and identifies ingredients that might not be good for your dog.
I'd rather not commit 1+ hrs for a question borne out of simple curiosity
thanks for this
Yeah no kidding! I want the best for my pup though so its worth it. Funny how much more I care about his health than mine lol
"There's still something in there..."
He wasn't selling dog food, he was trying to save my buddy some money.
So true! Am horrified that by-product is always high on the ingredient list though. 
Good to know!  I wish I had a Costco closer.  I tend to hit it up if I'm in Chicago, or visiting family in Madison.  Closest one though is over an hour from me, so it's not all that often.  
[deleted]
You must not have read to the end.
[deleted]
No the vet we took her to is the worst and the "perscription" food was just Royal Canine and is a dry kibble. With the oral Dysphagea she really needs that soft/wet food.
It was government pressure. Borosilicate glass was used heavily in drug creation due to the ability to drastically change temps without shattering.
Then they tempered it better or something because older Pyrex is definitely more drop resistant.  
I know. Thrift stores rock. I got a whole set of golf clubs with a leather bag for $20. They had belonged to a VP of a local tech company who paid $1,100 for them five years previous (he left a travel ID tag on them and I was able to track down the make and model of the clubs). If I played golf more then once every three years I'd be more impressed with that find. 
If your Pyrex has a green tint to it, it‚Äôs after the switch. That green tint is from it being made with soda-lime glass, which is weaker than borosilicate.
You can tell by the logo. All lower case = post change and all upper case = prior to
That's a not true. Certified USDA Organic provides the best indicator for food quality that we have. We know that without USDA certification, pet food is generally industrial waste, generally stuff that is bad news for pets.

> ¬†‚Äúorganic‚Äù has a precise meaning defined by the USDA‚Äôs National Organic Program (NOP). To be certified as organic, plant ingredients in pet foods must be grown without pesticides, artificial fertilizers, genetic modification, irradiation or sewage sludge. Animal ingredients must come from animals raised on organic feed, given access to the outdoors, and not treated with antibiotics or hormones. Producers must be inspected to make sure they adhere to these standards. 
 
--

> #By law, USDA certified¬†organic pet food must follow exactly the same requirements and standards as those established for organic human foods.

Choose USDA certified foods for your pets, or you literally feed them trash. Sad to say that that's the current state of the prolifically corrupt pet food industry. 
Small company?  Merrick was worth over $2 Billion when they were acquired.  
[deleted]
Wow, one person ITT who doesn't feed trash.  And you got downvoted. 
This is more abbreviated than the topic deserves, but Nestle has >30% dollar share in NA. Lots of brands spanning everything from value (Dog Chow) to premium mass (Purina One) to prescription vet diets. They do not however have any brands or any right-to-win with that portfolio in the space Merrick plays. If they take a shit on Merrick for a few bucks, that equity they've bought is toast, and then what? Still no brands that could extend into that space and they ruined the equity they bought. Again, I fully expect them to be looking for synergies, but not overhauling the diets, packaging, quality. IAMS via P&G was a good case study that none of the true Pet players (e.g. Purina, Mars) would want to repeat. 
[deleted]
I think they are more focused on profits than the well being of your pet plain and simple
Above commenter is mistaken. Diamond is far from top of the line, it isn't even above the halfway mark. Costco food is not food it is feed.
I hate it. I'm inundated with choice and I like being an informed consumer so I spend too much time on research. 
[deleted]
Can you go to a better vet, dry food is really bad for kidneys.
That is beyond idiotic. Yeah making drugs harder to make is going to stop drug production.
[deleted]
No. Like I said. Organic means nothing in terms of food. 

[The word "organic" is becoming little more than a money-maker for corporations who want to jump on the bandwagon.  In fact, the FDA and USDA, which are the very agencies that are supposed to be protecting the organic food supply, are intensely active in its adulteration.  A "certified organic" product can actually have a mix of organic and conventional ingredients.  In fact, under the law, you could manufacture "organic beer" with completely conventional hops, label it "USDA Certified Organic," and charge a premium price for it -- hops are allowed to be non-organic under USDA Certified Organic products.](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/02/09/amp/the-united-states-organic-deception.aspx) 
Lol please stop responding to me because you are grasping @ straws to argue. Like I said, if you have some data to counter my stance on things, then respond with those. Because the way you're responding is wasting more of both of our times when you could be looking into this instead of making me do it for you. Stop wasting your time grasping @ straws & maybe spend that time looking into this if it bothers you so much that I don't like corporations risks & self interests, not the interests of consumers. This line will lose customers & it's because of what I have previously stated. Still, I'm not going to risk buying food made by corporations for my pets because pets can't tell you when they feel like shit or when they're sick all the time like humans can. Have a good day. 
Thanks! I had a dog with chicken allergies that really got made me look at the ingredients of every pet food I've bought. My current dog is 10 and very fluffy and playful. I don't care about the downvotes, I'm going to go feed her a pound of raw bison and veggies and take her for a walk in the snow :)
That isn't the only time this has happened, and it has repeated over and over. Look what happened to California Naturals. Once a great food ruined by the greed of the corp that bought them. This happens all the time and doesn't seem to change. They haven't learned
It's not arbitrary when you consider the reason why they are rated the way they are. Which is based on overall quality of included ingredients.
Correct. Like 80% of consumer goods. 
I think there's a pretty big middle ground between "food" and "feed." I don't give my dogs food made by Diamond, but if a dog owner is making the choice to give "Nature's Domain" or whatever that grain free one is called at Costco over Pedigree/Ol'Roy, they're making a good decision. While I think pet ownership should gradually become more infrequent due to general irresponsibility of people... I don't think pet ownership should be limited to those who can afford Orijen/whatever either. 

(I feed Zignature kangaroo or catfish, been working alright for allergies my Australian shepherd has). 
Find a way to get paid for your research. Sharing it with others saves them time, which as you've noted, is valuable. Help the rest of us avoid these shitty products!
He should have spent more time in the 1980s Soviet Union waiting in line for the ONLY brand of any given product the state allows its people to have.
Yeah we're working on bringing her to the only board certified vet in our city. Unfortunately we've already spent a decent amount of money at this other place. We don't have her on dry food currently, we have her on the Freshpet food that is in the fridge at certain stores. A little high on the protein for her kidneys but we're running out of options.
It is funny that you can actually feel the difference. I have only been hunting for Pyrex the past year but you can feel a difference between older and newer Pyrex.
We're not talking about loose definitions concerning hops here, we're talking about, primarily, the relatively tight definitions concerning USDA organic meats, which have laws that are stringently applied, at least to the level that they provide a solid level of confidence in the quality of the meats.

You're making this out be about some yahoo tossing 'organic' on their label to sell crap, when what I'm talking about is USDA organic certified ingredients in pet foods.

It is clear that non-USDA-certified meats used in pet food are industrial waste and trash that you would never be allowed to feed directly to a human. Using USDA meats, particularly USDA Organic, is the indicator of quality for meat in pet foods.

#The fact is that a pet food that does not use USDA-certified meats is not a food that should be fed to pets or any other animal. 

The only reason to not use quality ingredients is because of the lucrative business that is selling industrial. Who needs to dispose of waste, what with the costs and efforts, when you can sell it for usage in the intentionally loosely-regulated arena of animal feed.

Good pet parent :)
So much unnecessary sensationalism. Water, like most tangible things in our world, is finite. People recognized that water availability was shrinking and capitalized by investing in it. Simple supply and demand economics. 

For the inevitable comment about "stealing" water or something to that effect: the Harvard endowment *purchased* the water rights from other people. That means someone else owned the water rights before them. At the end of the day, someone was going to own these rights, it was just a matter of who. 
[removed]
That's just a vague equivocation that could be applied to any business no matter how exploitative, and justified solely the basis that they paid for those water rights. 
Agreed. The headline from the paywalled [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-quietly-amasses-california-vineyardsand-the-water-underneath-1544456396) sounds more like journalism and less like an agenda:

> Harvard Quietly Amasses California Vineyards‚Äîand the Water Underneath

> Making a bet on climate change, the university‚Äôs $39 billion endowment has been snapping up farmland and the related water rights.

Well said
Everyone's property rights are, to some extent, curtailed by the laws mandated by the state. 

Changing the laws so as to effectively limit the obviously excessive practices of those, who exploit the loopholes, is an obligation of the state.

Property rights do not grant carte blanche. Nor does employing another individual, holding excessive wealth, etc.

All of man should be equal before an established set of laws. period. This is an ideal.
Stop using Trump's twitter feed like it's a valid source. You'll be less misinformed.
This was a logical roller coaster. Restricting the flow of water to help fish... I don't know what this means. Fish mostly live in the ocean so they're surrounded by water. Global warming has been promoted by scientists around the globe so it's not just liberals. I don't know what "importing illegals" has to do with water when this has to do with reparian rights and not immigration. 
lol i bet you accuse people of being npcs too
So you seem like a pretty abrasive person. I've gone through your post history to see pretty much what I expected. Lots of anti liberal stuff. Like a surprising amount. But no actual original opinions or anything constructive. 

You simultaneously believe "science is science and transgender==mental problem" and that scientists are all liberals that lie and fake their science to prove global warming is real. 

You're angry at liberal women quote "I hate them" but offer no explanation. You hate Bernie Sanders for pointing out Walmart doesn't pay their employees a living wage (going on to say he's a socialist, which I agree with but then you don't expand on that to say why it's bad). 

You're just a shell of a human touting whatever tickles your nipples without thinking about anything. 

And I'm sad for you. 
This article is deceptive in that it portrays the Harvard endowment fund as some conniving institution attempting to buy all water rights to dry out California. 

The reality is that someone owned the water rights before them. They simply made an investment decision and purchased water stock in the form of vineyards. The article's author is perfectly within her right to criticize the government for allowing such practices, but it is unfair to target a company doing lawful investments.  
I agree with what you state, I just don't understand the relevance. 
Ironic,  you think I care what you think.... 
Something being legal isn't the same as something being ethical. I think you're confusing the two.
Again, the with vague equivocating  

&nbsp;

Just because a market exists doesn't make it moral or just to participate in that market
In this case, you were arguing against the use of the word "stealing" since ownership rights had already been established.
The problem lies with their excersice of property rights that directly negatively affects the the local populace with water control measures etc.
By recognizing that water in this case is a common good then excessive exploitative use could be considered "stealing"


I never made any mention or suggestion of ethics. I think it was actually /u/danzofriend who mistook my statement as an equivocal way to tie in ethics into legality.  
What's so ambiguous about investment in natural resources? 

Natural resources are finite. People require natural resources. Water is a natural resource. Clean water supply is shrinking. Clean water demand is growing (more people, more pollution.) 

Therefore, the price of clean water will likely go up. Harvard endowment fund saw this and invested accordingly. I don't know how I can make that any more clear. 

Morality is another conversation entirely. If the author has an issue with the legality and/or morality of this type of investing, they should be criticizing local politicians and putting pressure on them, not a single party. 

Also, I would argue that water rights are best held by private interests. It both gives a financial interest to protect the source and ensures the most economic distribution of the water. 
Hence, my diatribe prior about everyone being equal and that property right should impose on the common good
"So much **unnecessary sensationalism**"     
"**Simple** supply and demand economics"     
"For the **inevitable** comment about "stealing"....."   
"someone else **owned** the water rights before them"   
And so on...  

&nbsp;

As you can see, you made many ethical arguments. You just implied them.
The empirical reality of an economic system of water rights isn't what's vague. What I'm pointing to is your argument that because water rights have existed in an economy, that criticism of participation in that market is "unnecessary sensationalism" and not "stealing". You start with nonspecific quantitative statements, but then use them to justify your qualitative statements. Then you claimed the argument of morality were two different argument after making it the center of your argument in your opening sentence. The actions of someone's local government don't erase the implications of a company's actions.

Take for instance if your local government becomes corrupt and decide all your assets now belong to them. Then your government sold them to me for $1. If I then walk into your home and start taking things as I see fit would you simply say this is "simple supply and demand economics", and any complaining would about "stealing" would be "unnecessary sensationalism"?

You can argue that water rights are best held by private parities, but reality has [shown that to be a false](https://www.newsweek.com/nestle-michigan-town-bottled-water-river-799495) conclusion. A consistent story has been shown of Nestle leveraging regulatory capture to pay under market rates for their water. The actions of both parties should be criticized. 

I'm getting the sense you like economic theories, but don't correlate them to the actual realities in which they are applied.

So I think you guys are having a bit of a miscommunication. 

The argument is that the article is unfairly targeting Harvard for smartly investing in a market that already exists. 

Whereas the counter argument is they should be targeted because they're profiting off of bad vibes. 

Bad vibes in this context are feelings, theories, and other intangible, unsourced, or unprovable statements about the possible damage caused by the market of buying water rights.

No, of course not. But that is a different premise as opposed to the California water rights scenario, so it's irrelevant. Please provide sources of California officials appropriating water rights and proceeding to have a firesale of said rights. 

>A consistent story has been shown of Nestle leveraging regulatory capture to pay under market rates for their water

Would you mind providing the source? Seems interesting. 

And that story you linked didn't provide any factual basis for damage. It used fickle language like "people *believe* Nestle is diminishing local water levels." I can only assume Nestle was able to successfully sue in court because the denial of their upgraded pipe wasn't based on anything in reality, just conjecture and half-baked theories. Don't know for sure since I haven't read the case or a summary, would be interesting though. 

>I'm getting the sense you like economic theories, but don't correlate them to the actual realities in which they are applied.

Again, link me articles where concrete, demonstrable damage to the environment has been caused on account of private water ownership. Leveraging water rights for economic gain are not environmental damages, just so we're clear in your citations. 
Go play the "request a million citations which are never specific enough or I win" game with someone else.   

I've said my piece, and you are clearly not going to get off your circular self justifying logic wheel
You have to concede that linking me an article which is entirely based off of people's beliefs doesn't warrant any credibility. C'mon. 
"I'm think I'm right, therefore I am, regardless of proof" is the kind of argument you're fighting against. 

You won't win.

Why doesn't Oregon start their own label and actually benefit from this. We don't want to sell water rights to Nestle....also ever heard of the drought?
Seriously, Nestle? Fucking lead?

Wait, Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream may contain peanuts? What kind of sick world are we living in?
That's what I thought it said at first, but then I re-read it. The problem is that some cartons that are labeled "chocolate chocolate chip" *really* contain "chocolate peanut butter".
I was all ready to jump on the hate train for rent-seeking corporatism, then I read the article:

>Nestl√© says that in 2014, the company bought about 50 million gallons from Sacramento, including water that is used in plant operations as well as sold in bottles. The total amount is less than two-thousandths of 1 percent of the city‚Äôs total annual water usage, company spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said.

> Nestl√© does not receive a discount or special rate for water that it buys from Sacramento, Nestle officials said. The company pays about $1 per 100 cubic feet of water, the same as any metered business or manufacturer, officials said.

> Nestl√©‚Äôs figures ‚Äúare in line with the water usage data collected by the city,‚Äù Sacramento spokeswoman Rhea Serran said in an email.
This is a smoke screen.  Bottled water is a tiny percentage of California's water useage.  The Ag industry wants to deflect.

Edit:  To add some numbers and examples for some of the comments I've been getting: Water bottling in California uses the nearly the equivalent of a single golf courses' water use.  There are over 1,100 golf courses in California.

Going after water bottling to fix a drought is the equivalent of hitting a single cockroach with a sledgehammer, then declaring victory over bugs.

Edit #2: Anyone still harping on the fact that bottled water should be curtailed is still missing the point.  Water bottling is stealing fractions of a penny while Agriculture is [burning big piles of $100 bills.](https://youtu.be/EDAA5o6xMc4?t=72)

TIL lots of Cali companies wastes water in a lot of ways
Bottled water is a massive scam but it's not the reason for California's water troubles. The state hasn't built a new reservoir in 30 years despite its population having grown by over 15 million people in that time span. 
Considering the horrible things Nestle has done over the years this is practically benign.  
But they ignore the 70 million gallons of water California used to frack last year

Okay. I've seen this circulating on Tumblr and I haven't made a response about it because I probably couldn't get through there. However, I hope I can get through here: 

The article says that the plant bought about 50 million gallons in 2014 - that's about 136986 gallons a day. 

According to Google, California has a population of about 38.8 million as of 2014.

[According to this site](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/qa-home-percapita.html), the average American uses 80-100 gallons of water a day - so let's play it safe and say that the average Californian uses 60. 

60 gallons per day per person times 38800000 people equals 2328000000, or 2.328 billion gallons of water a day. Divide 136986 (Nestle's daily water usage) by 2328000000 and multiply by 100 (for the percentage) and you get .005%. At 40 gallons per person per day, you get .008%. 20 gallons, .01%. They're not even making a pockmark. 

I'm not saying what they're doing is or isn't wrong, the fact is that they're not even making the smallest of dents compared to (the average) water usage of residential California. 

The real problem is that [27% of California is farmland](http://stuffaboutstates.com/california/agriculture.htm) (scroll down to the bottom),  and a good chunk of the total area of California is desert. 
"selling it back to the public at 1,000 percent profit"  
  
That's total nonsense. The cost of packaging, handling, distribution, etc is what you're paying for. The wholesale price for bottle water, the price Nestle is actually paid for those bottles, is very low. If you look at their financials, they are making good money, but their profits are fraction of what their wholesale price is, they are not making 1,000% profit, that person clearing understands very little about business. 
Does Cali have or are there plans to build a desalination plant? I mean if shits getting that serious why not contract one to be built. 
bottled water is almost never wasted and almost always drank entirely. you can be upset about the plastic but not the actual water. 
As someone who has worked at a Nestle Waters bottling facility, I can assure you, there are bigger things to worry about than one of these water factories.  I understand everyone likes to hate Nestle, but there is very little waste water used compared to water bottled.  Even cases that have to be scrapped are recycled, both the water and the packaging.  In fact, there were many months were we had 100% recycling (the only time we didn't was when he had to empty the compactor, which wasn't more often than once every few months).

Also, the fact they only purchased 50M gallons of water means they likely aren't producing as much as they could, as even one production line should be able to produce 260M half liter bottles a year (running around 80-85% efficiency), which would be 68.5M gallons of water.
It takes one gallon of water to make one almond. I think these people are barking up the wrong tree.
They are bottling California drinking water and using it for...drinking?  Oh the humanity.  What about pesticide companies using up to 5 gallons of water per home on lord knows how many houses?  All the yards and cars being washed with clean drinking water?  All the city fountains?  All the wealthy people in town with their elaborate fountains and pools?  I frankly don't think nestle is all that high on the priority list.  People just like to whine.
How much water is used by other manufacturing processes?  This is a relatively small amount of water compared to the BILLIONS of gallons used for other industry and the TRILLIONS used for farming.  
how about people focus on something that would make a difference, like the 80% of water used for agriculture?  How about California doesn't grow luxury food items during a drought?  
Nestle's response: "Seriously? This is like the least evil thing we do!"
35 million people in CA. By the time everyone does their morning piss/shit, more water has been used than Nestle uses all year.
>Nestl√© says that in 2014, the company bought about 50 million gallons from Sacramento, including water that is used in plant operations as well as sold in bottles. The total amount is less than two-thousandths of 1 percent of the city‚Äôs total annual water usage

< .002% of the city's water is used at this plant.  I wouldn't even consider shutting down the plant a start to the reform we need to get out of this drought.
Seattle here. You can have some of our rain,  just stay in California. 
It's fucking laughable to me that:

1. Californians have waited this long to get worked up over the water situation

2. They really think one factory is the source of their woes

3. They really think, at this late stage, protests mean anything.

The state's over-extended on water use in every single way, it's been so for a long time, and a few angry citizens with signs isn't going to magically return rain and snowfall to the state. 

They need to look at spooling down agriculture, spooling down fracking, and generally spooling down the entire state until it gets to a sustainable level. 

Will they do so? no. They'll keep looking for scape goats forever.
Hopefully this stresses people to find how to make cheap and efficient water desalination methods
They're off the hook: "The total amount is less than two-thousandths of 1 percent of the city‚Äôs total annual water usage, company spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said."
[deleted]
My family in California is just angry that they can't water their massive lawn.
Two Thousandths of a percent.  Not seeing overwhelming waste here compared to other water users.
Lol.... politics are so retarded.... They're protecting the farmers who use much more water than "bottled water" and we actually need water to drink, we can import crops... who's dumb idea was it to try and grow crops in the desert anyway? 
Do these morons even realize that the agriculture industry is the problem?
The big agriculture industries are apparently doing a very good job of diverting attention away from themselves and to "an evil giant corporation" for producing clean drinking water. 
For god's sake leave this alone people. There are a lot of reasons to hate bottled water. The amount of water being bottled IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
Ice bucket challenge wouldn't have faired so well if it were viral this year
Lets see, massively wasteful meat industry, almond industry, bottling water for resale in a historically drought plagued area and massive agriculture in an area where most of it never had the natural aquifer to support it as well as building massive cities and industrial bases in areas that never had the natural resources to support it.  Found the cause of California's problem.  Greedy idiots.  You're welcome.  Now you find the fix and can we make it a logical, common sense one please.
Desalinization plants. FIN. 
Well, if the new data is to be trusted, there's going to be more water available as soon as the delta smelt goes extinct. I believe the last test batch found 5 of them in a pretty large area of the delta. So that could mean water that can be re-directed to where it's needed.
Under no circumstances should the gold-rush population of California turn into the water-rush population and seek land in Florida.  After all, you can't eat water.
Agriculture is the problem, they use the majority of the water in an extremely wasteful fashion. There needs to be more efficiency there. This is minor
Honestly Nestl√©  should stick to chocolate milk cause their bottled water is nasty.
How about the 300 billion gallons that went towards protecting a tiny endangered fish?
The ceo of nestle has said on record that free natural accessible water is not a human right and should be privatized
This news is just upsetting.

A small step. But speaking with your wallet says a lot. 
As much as Nestle sucks raw eggs, the real culprit here is Big Ag.
This is distraction from fraking
Californian here. Is it true we're going to run out of all water and die in a year?
Instead of arguing about which industry to punish, why not implement a price floor for non-residential water? Isn't that the approach that is normally taken in the case of an undervalued resource?
Well time to raise goats now
Just an interesting factoid I came across.  How many of you knew there already IS a desalination facility in California?  

Background

In the face of a challenging water supply crisis in the late 1980‚Äôs, the City of Santa Barbara (City) constructed a seawater desalination facility as an emergency supply. The production capacity of the facility was 7,500 acre feet per year (AFY) with the potential for expansion up to 10,000 AFY.  The neighboring water districts of Montecito and Goleta contracted for entitlements of 1,250 AFY and 3,069 AFY, respectively, during the five year contract period.  The City had entitlement to 3,181 AFY.  All sharing of costs for construction was based on these entitlements.

After the plant was constructed, it was operated between March and June of 1992.  Due to abundant rainfall in the 1991-1992 winter and subsequent winters, the City‚Äôs drought condition was relieved and the desalination plant was placed into a standby mode.  The $34 million total construction cost was paid off during the initial 5-year contract period by the City, Goleta Water District, and Montecito Water District, with a City share of approximately $14.5 million.  However, the Goleta and Montecito Water Districts did not elect to extend or renew their interest in the facility after the initial five year contract period.

On June 4, 1991, City voters elected to make desalination a permanent part of the City‚Äôs water supply portfolio. With the approval of the Long Term Water Supply Program on July 5, 1994 (LTWSP1994) the City added the desalination facility to its permanent sources of water. An Environmental Impact Report on the LTWSP1994 was certified on May 24, 1994. On October 15, 1996, the California Coastal Commission issued a Coastal Development Permit to the City for permanent desalination facilities up to a maximum capacity of 10,000.  The permit provided for intermittent and base load operation.

Nestle owns the ag companies  directly/indirectly which are using all the water so it can sell the public water
"Crunch Nestle"
That's the best name ever.
The issue with water in CA isn't Nestle, although I thought so at one point.  Do a little research and you will find that most of the issue is the global obsession with the consumption of Almonds.  One gallon of water per almond.

According to the Agricultural Marketing Center, CA produced 2 billion pounds of almonds in 2012 alone. 

That is approximately 800 billion almonds per year = 800 billion gallons of water.  Nestle used about 244 million that they bottled and was resold, mostly in CA.  That is what?  1/3 of 1% of what the almond industry is using?

Come on guys.  Lets point the finger at the actual deserving culprit here/
This is a huge problem in other places where companies lock down safe water sources leaving unsafe sources for the population (or demanding payment for access). In California there is still far enough water to drink and bottle. 
So get angry at the municipality for selling water to them cheaply. This sounds like the same issue with the farmers.
I know this is horrible but being from Michigan and hearing about a drought in California just feels like [this] (http://blog.piktureplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/This-raccoon-hasn%E2%80%99t-had-this-much-fun-since-trash-day.gif)
I guess we can call this Watergate.
There are two things happening here and they're not connected:

1) People are stupid enough to pay a premium for bottled tap water

2) local authorities are creating ineffective restrictions on households 

Blaming Nestl√© for either of those is silly. Blame people and blame local authorities.
WE could (heaven forbid-unamerican) learn from other nations who suffer from lack of drinking(usable) water and yet live near where there is a lot of salty water. They invested in water desalination plants... i know i know it might mean we might have to buy one or two less F-35's or a drone or two but we ALL need to sacrifice,right? And cal. has the largest  body of water in the world as its western border,right?
Why don't we just take Los Angeles, and push it somewhere else?!
This isn't the first time California has been having issues with water. I remember reading about this when I was in middle school, which was nearly twenty years ago. Instead of making a big issue now, they should've been finding a solution years ago. Here's what Australia did when they were having a similar issue few years back (old article but I know the electric generations are built already): http://www.treehugger.com/clean-water/new-australian-desalination-plant-will-use-100-renewable-energy.html
http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581700 Romans could have fixed the drought
For the sake of curiosity: I know that agriculture is a huge component of the Californian economy, but how bad would it hurt the state if Sacramento imposed stricter limits on cash crops like almonds, versus food products with a wider appeal and usage (tomatoes, etc.)?
It's not mentioned here, but the REAL story is that about half of all homes in Sacramento have no water meters. Yes, if you want to take an hour-long shower, there's nothing stopping you. You just pay $42.  Absolutely insane.

At least that's being rectified. Finally.

The math has already been done on this. 70 million gallons is not a lot in context. Nestle is not abnormal in their use of water, or its cost, and they are not polluting it, while other water users are. They are making a killing on selling bottles of water to idiots who buy bottled water, yes, but it's the least of California's worries. You realize how much water it takes to keep an average golf course green in Sacramento? ~40 million gallons per year. How many residential lawns it takes to consume 70 million gallons in a year? Less than 1000. Nestle is a nice big target. But it's hypocritical to target them without also targeting golf courses, lawns, and the other ridiculously wasteful (and polluting) water users. That's fine and all to write a news story about Nestle and its destractors, but to give zero context about other comparable water uses is shoddy journalism.

http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/cep/ep_706ehep.pdf

The San Joaquin river is the largest source of tap and irrigation water in California.  It provides enough water to supply all the farms in the central valley. 
In recent years the government of California has been deliberately diverting 70% of the water from the river into the ocean in order to protect a species of endangered minnow known as the delta smelt.

This is not a problem caused by a drought. 


That plant is a drop in the bucket. Farms are soaking up much more. The only way to have averted this crisis was to have better foresight and plan ahead. That has not been done and now unless the weather patterns swing toward California's favor, they are in big trouble. 
That's all of those Northern California people. I used to live up there and talk of the drought was common and people tried to do things to help slow down the loss of water for the state. Now, however, I live in Southern California and people could care less here, lol. It's both funny and sad, but the water being saved up North is just being used by us in the South down here. The only think I've noticed is some local business have stopped running their fountains at all hours.
Oh noes!  They are stealing all your water, Calfornians.  Get your pitch forks and demand justice!  The drought has nothing to do with the lack of rain, or the massive farms growing in what is essentially desert but instead an evil, Republican, water bottling company, set up for profit.
Okay, serious question here. I read somewhere (I don't exactly know where) that the state of California had a order to pump water into the Bay Area to try and get an endangered species of fish (The Delta Smelt) to breed and it has failed, yet they still pump water instead of conserving it, why? Why wouldn't humanity take priority over this fish? Is it a keystone species? Don't species just naturally go extinct eventually?
Why are they always in need to blame someone?

If you want to see Nestle getting away with cheap water costs, come to Hope, B.C. Here they pay $2.25 CAD ($1.85 USD) per million litres. That's $7.00 USD per million gallons. They pay the B.C. government $562 CAD ($462 USD) every year for extracting water from the Hope aquifer.


It takes 4000 to 18000 gallons of water to make a Hamburger. How many of these Nestle protesters do you think stopped by McDonald's on their way back home? Barking up the wrong tree is being kind - these guys are 1000 parsecs from Earth barking into the void.

California is growing 80% of the world's almonds in desert conditions and they're pissed at a bottling company? I mean CA could also stop producing fucking RICE but let's blame the bottling company. 
Good. Selling public tap water back to the public for a profit is offensive at the best of times.
During a drought it's outright criminal.
[deleted]
>then I read the article

STOP THAT
the cows in CA use more water than almonds or any of the silly examples in most comments downthread.
So that 50,000,000 gallons of water only cost them $66,844. There are 7.48 gallons of water per cubic foot, which means that if they pay $1/100 cubic feet of water, then there are 748 gallons per dollar (7.48 gallons to 1 cubic foot). 50,000,000/748=66,844
That's what I don't get.  What rational reason is there for picking on Nestle rather than:

A) ALL bottled water companies.  Bottled water is a huge waste of material and money as it is;
B) the biggest users of water, industrial or otherwise.  This is penny wise, pound foolish stuff if you're going after bottled water;
C) the idiots who water their ornamental lawns and other frivolous uses in the middle of a drought.

If water supply is the problem, then set your priorities in terms of the allowable demands and stick to them and/or make the low priority ones pay through the nose for what water they do use (to fund infrastructure improvements to supply).
You telling me using millions of gallons of water on pistachios so I can have something to nibble on isn't worth it? How dare you.
Smoke screen for sure. It happens all the time, the common household is blamed for water shortage, using too much electricity, and so forth, while city centers continues to burn bright at 2am and water parks  continue to be built and golf courses stay green, and misting units keep people cool on a hot day.  If you live in the desert or an arid region, then acclimate. 

The only reason Nestle needs to be taken to task is it takes more water to make those bottles than water in the bottle. 
Most In-N-Out Burger restaurants in southern California sell 20-30,000 burgers a week. They have roughly 150 locations in So-Cal alone. That is 150(312.5x20,000)=937,500,000 gallons a week at one chain that just has 260 locations (Never mind McD's, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut etc.).I use In-N-Out as an example because they use (Edit: exclusively) California beef in their California/Nevada/Oregon/Utah locations maybe Arizona too. This would actually bring the locations number closer to 260-ish. 260(312.5x20,000)=1,625,000,000gallons. A week. Or 84,500,000,000 annually. Can some one convert that to acre feet?

Edit: 2500 gallons for a lb. of beef. In N Out patty is 1/8th of a pound 

Edit2:  259,320 acre feet annually.

Edit3: should also be noted that this is only for the beef. This does not include cheese/lettuce/tomato etc.
Yeah, it's weird. I mean, yelling at corporate usage of water in California? Yes. Yelling at Nestle for [the shit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9#Controversies) they do? Yes. Hell, even complaining about Nestle's bottled water when there's a reason (like the "tap water advertised as natural spring source water" thing)? Still yes! But this? This is bullshit. It's not even like they aren't providing a service. Is California exporting more bottled water than it is importing it? Do they lack bottled waters? Because if the water stays in California and people choose to consume it from bottles rather than from their tap, who the hell cares? Nestle is providing the same service every bottled water company provides: it makes water come to you inside of a bottle instead of you tap. That's what you pay for.
Specifically, animal ag.
For those of you that may have forgotten your fractions and percentages, you may express "less than two-thousandths of 1 percent" like this: 

    0.0019%
Golf courses in California use brown water.
You are now a mod of /r/nongolfers. 
But what will white people do on the weekends? 
Water is wasted everywhere in CA. Leaking hydrants, leaking this leaking that. Yet people cry if your faucet runs for 3 minutes instead of 2.

It's really not a scam. You are paying for the bottles and the convenience. I paid $3 for a 32 pack of water today, people work at the factory which bottles it(plus other people at the factory that makes the raw plastic etc), those bottles are distributed by truck drivers to hundreds of stores, store workers have to keep the shelves stocked with those heavy ass 32 packs, etc. $0.09 a bottle for that convenience is not a scam to me. Although personally I just use the store brand purified via reverse osmosis(surely originally from tap also), but I'm not going to pay a dime more for spring water. Plus I can pee in the empty bottle when when I am naked in my dorm room and don't have to get dressed to go to the public bathroom. That in it'self is worth the $0.09
Yeah, they even paid for the water straight up, no legal loopholes or unscrupulousness. This is not the reason for the drought, and doesn't even have an impact on the situation really.
Building reservoirs is useful when there's *too much* precipitation and you want to hold some in reserve instead of letting it flow downstream out of your use area. In recent years California has had too little precipitation: any new reservoirs would be dry, empty photo opportunities for politicians to say ‚Äúlook how much water we don't have‚Äù and nothing more.
Its a total scapegoat for the real problem. I'm sure some people here will bring up what the CEO said. However, most people don't put it in context or even quote him right. His comments were not evil or malicious in anyway. He basically said water needs to be given a value instead of being given away for practically free like it currently is. 

I happen to have typed up the exact words. The video is translated into English though.

> ‚Äúit‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population and there are two different options on the matter. The one opinion which I think is extreme is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about decalring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. And the other view says that water is a food stuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value. Personally I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff value so that we‚Äôre all aware that it has its price. And then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to water, and there are many different possibilities there. 


This is exactly what you'll see if you were to watch the video. Also, he isn't currently the CEO and hasn't been since 2007. 
I believe there is an article that states, the water paid for by the energy companies has been purchused at top dollar, and brings in Millions to the Cali economy.   

While the Agriculture water, used to produce crops, has been government funded and paid for with Pennies on the Dollar.     


Probably because that number is utterly insignificant as a proportion of the total water usage in California.
That's 106(.02) Olympic sized swimming pools([ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-size_swimming_pool)).

Which actually doesn't seem like as many as I was expecting.
70 million gallons is only 200 acre feet of water. That's about 200 households of water and is VERY little in the grand scheme of things.

Did you even read the article?
Would you be surprised to learn that about 9x that amount is used for steam flooding, which is the primary way oil is produced in places like Bakersfield? Probably would be, as most people just latch on to scary things instead of actually trying to understand and comprehend what is going on.
How does stupid misleading comments like the above get upvoted?

Fracking takes up a miniscule amount of water compared to the total and brings in a HUGE amount of tax revenue. If the only issue with fracking was the water they would be doing 5000% more.

I really want climate change to be dealt with but I have 0 faith in the environmental lobby because they're filled with idiots like the above.
Do you know how much 70m gallons of water costs to purchase.  
If I told you it was under $30,000, would you believe me?
From the article: "He added that members of Crunch Nestl√© also are concerned about the use of large amounts of water in hydraulic fracturing ‚Äì or ‚Äúfracking‚Äù ‚Äì which injects fluid into underground rock to release natural gas and oil.

That's nothing.
Because 70 million gallons is practically nothing.
Fracking comes up all the time on NextDoor for my community.  (I live in Southern California.)

The truth is fracking isn't part of the problem.  Out of the 38 billion gallons of water California uses each day, fracking is 2 million -- or .005%.


Duh, California is a liberal paradise state. They'd rather deflect and talk on and on about how the south is fracking like they aren't.
I think the real problem is that (Southern) California is overpopulated. 
Nestle said in their statement that that they earn about a 10% operating margin on their bottled water sales. Let's take a gander shall we?

Revenue - ~~6.9% of Nestle'e total revenue of 91.6 billion dollars = $6,320,400,000~~The [2014 Financial statements](http://www.nestle.com/asset-library/documents/library/documents/financial_statements/2014-financial-statements-en.pdf) show a revenue of $7,755,680.92

Bottle - $0.01, or $3,786,982.24 total.

Water - 189,270.5892 m^3/100 = 1892.71 billable units of water * 0.9963 = $1,885.71
6,400,000,000 ounces of water, 16.9 in a bottle = 378,698,224 bottles of water able to be produced, and each bottle of water cost Nestle $0.00000497945.

Labor - $2,217,600 = (((($15hrly*8hrs)*7days)*4wks)*12mths)*55 workers = $40,320 to each worker before taxes and withdrawals, and before any additional benefits. Cost per bottle was $0.00586 (total labor/total no of bottles produced

Warehouse Expenses - ???

Marketing Expenses - ???

Administrative Expenses - ???

Operating Profit (So far) - $1,749,212.97 

Operating Profit (By Nestle) - $749,331.01

So we can expect that the three unknowns we have here are equal to $999,882.

TL;DR - Nestle isn't full of shit, and they aren't making bookoo bucks off of bottled water. They're bringing in about 0.00535% of the companies $14 billion operating profit. And they're giving Californians 302,958,579 bottles of water. 
Yes, the word they were looking for was [markup](https://www.google.com/search?q=markup&oq=markup&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i65j0l3.695j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8). They are selling it to the customer at a markup of 1,000%.
I think that there's one/some in San Diego, but it's expensive as hell.
Yes, there is a 50 million gallon per day plant that will be going online in San Diego as early as this fall and another mothballed 50 MGD plant in Orange county that is also being considered to restart that would go online in 2018.  There's also a mothballed one in Santa Barbera that could be brought online with a little investment and other projects being considered all along the coast.  They're mainly waiting to see how the San Diego plant will do before they start, as far as environmentally impacting the coast and producing at capacity without issues.  I don't think either of those things will be a problem though personally.  
Source:  I work for an environmental consulting company in SoCal and worked on the Carlsbad (
San Diego) pilot plant.
If I'm not mistaken there *was* a desalination plant built in Santa Barbara during a drought in the 80s, but ended up not being used once the drought ended, and eventually was shut down. 

Edit: Santa Barbara not San Diego.  Also, [link to article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-santa-barbara-desal-20150303-story.html).
A desal plant is coming on line in San Diego, and the same company is re-applying for permits to open a plant in OC (permits were previously denied). 

It is expensive, though. An acre-foot of water costs double thru desal than it does through traditional sources. 

And the problem is the boom-bust cycle. It's dry now so desal seems like an ok investment. Then when El Ni√±o comes we're like "wtf why am I paying for desal?!"

Desal is part of the answer. So is conservation. But do is increased storage. 
Desalination is very costly and very inefficient. Plants take in about twice as much water as they produce iirc, and even in the months it would take to build one it would be very unlikely to have the capacity to suit the needs of a large population. 
It takes more water to make the plastic bottle than the amount of water the bottle contains.

> It takes one gallon of water to make one almond.

Almonds are absolutely the wrong target. Almonds are a crop that California's climate is absolutely amazing for, where the rest of the country would have substantial issues growing them.

The better targets are: alfalfa, corn, rice, and pasture. All of those are crops that either can be grown perfectly well elsewhere in the US or, really, don't even need to be grown at all. [Combined they take up 36% of California's water usage.](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioxGQ8Aa3JlMZdI5lDdaCgtc-Vk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale\(\)/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2365500/Screen_Shot_2014-10-17_at_3.15.20_PM.0.png) *All* nuts and fruits combine to take up 25% -- not just almonds. Alfalfa in particular is a horrible case, using up 14% of California's water and being grown ~~almost solely~~ in no small part as a low-value animal feed to be exported abroad, grown largely due to the byzantine rules guiding California's water rights and the fact that it can be grown in between the growing seasons of other crops.
It takes way more water to raise someone's steak.
>It takes one gallon of water to make one almond.

That's a cute version of the basic statistic, which measures how much water is required to bring an almond orchard to maturity over as long as four years.

Where does the water go?
I think your are just regurgitating what you seen here on reddit.  That isn't the main problem.
It doesn't do ANY good whatsoever to just think that farmers are going to stop growing some of their crops because they may seem unnecessary. I do t know where you grew up, but I was raised in the Central Valley of California where much of your food probably come from. These farmers are alive because of these crops. We can't just tell farmers to stop growing their crops or to grow less. The economic downturn of these farmers growing little to no crops only creates another problem. Where would these farmers turn to make money? And what kind of money would we have to spend to get food from other parts of the world 24/7/365?
Northern California has been pissed about the water situation since the 60's. My mom remembers when everyone was pissed when they put the pumps in. It wouldn't surprise me if this was a red herring by the argribusiness down south, they've been known to do shit like this.

A bunch of them got together when the Delta Smelt was ESA listed under the name 'Coalition for a Sustainable Delta' http://www.sustainabledelta.com/
They blamed everything under the sun for the Delta Smelt's decline except for the fact that 70% of it's habitat was being shipped down south.
I'd like to say that stupidity is not local to California, and not representative of everyone in California (it may be of the majority). It's also not common for individuals to see the effects of their water use on the supply, or for people to check up on X corporation's water consumption (before the drought was covered in the news). People tend to be short-sighted and blame as a defense mechanism.
Poland Springs is owned by Nestle. 
I used to respect Governor Brown until it became clear he has no intention of restricting farmers' usage of water, but instead wants to crack down on the 20% of water usage by everybody else outside of agriculture.
"Approximately nine million acres of farmland in California are irrigated, representing roughly 80% of all human water use."

Yea, it seems silly that they would go after just the water bottling plant. I'm sure there are many other beverage producers in the state that use water as a main ingredient. Why not them? Also, why only the fracking industry? Are there no other industrial activities using large amounts of water in CA? Or is that just the hot industry to protest at this time? If you want to protest on water use, get'em all.
Why not both?
Not only that, but people overlook the fact that if they stopped selling that water, it wouldn't make any dent in the consumption of water at all. Why? Because the people who buy it are still thirsty and will still drink some sort of fluid.
> They are a bad company

Why are they bad? 
Better press [this](http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqamr2upD01qdvatvo1_500.png).
Almonds are mostly a luxury though
its like a 4900% mark up on tap water...
If they are 100% efficient they can fill 5816 16.9oz bottles. I can buy a 24-28 pack for $3.99 at almost any store. So they that's about $0.16 a bottle. Which is about $930 revenue from $1 worth of water not counting all other operating cost.
It takes about a gallon of water to make a single almond.

I used to work at a food manufacturer, and our electric bill was a quarter million dollars a month. That's even worse than it sounds because we got a "bulk discount" which means we paid about half of what a residential user did per kwh. I loved the insanity of it all. We'd install motion detector switches in the bathrooms to "save electricity", and leave large (10+ hp) motors running because "it took too much work for the shutdown and startup sequence" 

Most golf courses use non-potable water.
So tell me how much water should I get for 8 double doubles? Cause my water bill is high. Can I off set that by ordering my beef in water consumption stats?
Those calculations may be right, however, I assume they don't get every single pound of meat used in fast food restaurants in California in-state. I imagine a good portion of that meat may be coming from another state without a drought.
In n out has 300 stores, your numbers might be off in CA

To put this into further perspective: estimates say that it will take [11 Trillion gallons](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/us/california-rains-and-drought/) to end the dought in California.

(84.5x10^9 / 11x10^12)*100 = 0.76%

We'd have to off-set the water production of every In-and-Out location over 130 times in order to end the drought.  

One bottled water plant almost doesn't matter at all in the face of things.




Or you can look at a bigger offender in California, one who quite literally ships water out of their state as a business model. Just one California brewery uses ~50 million gallons a year. Sierra Nevada brews 300,000 barrels a year. It takes 6 barrels of water, to make one barrel of beer, a barrel is 31 gallons. That's 55 million gallons a year. If you take in what it uses to actually grow the products to make beer, it goes up even higher. It takes 200 gallons of water to grow a pound of barley. About 60 pounds are used for every barrel of beer. They used 18 million pounds of barley, which takes 3.6 billion gallons of water to grow. Granted the barely isn't grown in California, but they are using local water sources to make their products and ship them all over the world. Hops are grown by Sierra Nevada in California, to get a pound of dried product, they need 500 gallons of water. They will use about a pound per barrel of beer (conservative figure), which is about 150 million gallons.

Technically, one brewery in California is shipping 200 million gallons of beer across the US, and world, a year. A four times larger offender than Nestle bottling water and selling it in a 200 mile radius.

Even then, isn't a lot of the bottled water in those places polluted as well? 
well for americans it's a scam.  I've been drinking tap water for years.

California lets lots of runoff run into the ocean quite often when there is lots of snow/rain.  The state needs to build more reservoirs so that when there is a surplus it will be stored for when a drought occurs and it is actually needed.

Food waste creates a major loss of resources and money. Water is one of those resources. If we stopped wasting half the food we usually do, we could make a huge impact in the water shortage.
This is pretty much exactly the argument made by IMF, World Bank, and Bechtel [during the lead up](http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/timeline.html) to the Bolivian water privatization fiasco and subsequent "War Over Water" earlier this century.     
    
         
    
    
> When asked about the events in Cochabamba during a press conference in Washington, D.C., World Bank President James Wolfensohn maintains that people in Bolivia and elsewhere should be charged for the use of public services (such as water), as public subsidies of such services lead to waste. **According to Wolfensohn, "The biggest problem with water is the waste of water through lack of charging."**        
    
How quickly we forget.
    
And he's perfectly right, in an American type of way.  If it has no value, all you are left with, is controls on how it's used.  And those controls are going to try to approximate a balance of personal use and business, but at no point is going to be as fine grained as price in a functioning market economy.
Still sounds pretty evil to me. 
It's much easier to just rip corporations though, the shitty government policies couldn't ever be to blame.

There's definitely a disconnect in how difficult it is for us to fathom these huge numbers.  Nestle has a good defense, if anyone cared to consider it: http://www.capradio.org/articles/2014/11/06/nestle-water-plants-impact-on-sacramentos-supply

> Brown said roughly three-quarters of the water bottled by the company in California, stays in the state. He said the water is shipped from the plant in a radius of roughly 200 miles.

I don't know if their numbers have been fact checked by anyone yet, but it's highly unlikely he would lie.
Not only that but fracking waters are often re-filtered to the point of drinking water quality after being used  (so long as fracking companies do their due diligence). That way, the water is used, filtered, and is then perfectly drinkable again. It doesn't just disappear like some claim it does (from fracking, anyways). It's water.

It's in the process of being built. People around here are joking that we're(Californians) gonna dry out the sea.
Exactly. There not idiots, its not like they don't know the technology is out there, its just too expensive to justify given what you can sell water at. 
Okay, but what's the end game, if not a desalination plant? Are Californians under the impression this is the worst of it, and conservation will be sufficient? 
Well it certainly wouldn't take *less*. 
Almonds are just an example used to demonstrate the incredible amount of water necessary for luxury foods. Your Alfalfa example is also factually wrong. While it makes for a good headline, only a small portion of Alfalfa is actually exported as there is plenty of demand for animal feed in the United States. The answer is simply to let water prices faced by agriculture to rise to market levels and therefore fairly optimal redistribution will occur. Whether more of the water goes to almonds or alfalfa doesn't really matter as the market will arrive at a fairly optimal result in the end.

You don't just get 1 steak from 1 cow. You get leather, steak, hamburger, milk for the duration of the life of the cow, etc. 

All you get from 1 almond is 1 fucking almond which supposedly takes 1 gallon of water to grow.
Back into the jet stream I'd imagine?
No one is telling Farmers to stop growing crops. Just stop growing water wasting crops. Almonds and rice should be grown in a wet climate. It is time that we reinvented ourselves as a climate-friendly state. Most the crops I have ever seen was grown very near the Ocean. Overcast skies and cooler temps help a lot. 
Diminishing resources and a constantly growing population. Less places for other animals to live. Makes survival harder for other animals and plants. It's the story the world over, and idiots pretend human overpopulation is not a problem.
Bottled water is just terrible in general. If more people drank their municipal tap water more people would care about their local water sheds. Also its ridiculously unsustainable to create a plastic bottle for every serving of water even if it is recycled.

Only appropriate use of disposable bottled water is during disasters where other potable water sources have been compromised.
Though they might drink fluid bottled elsewhere, instead of in California.
For a long time they would give women in 3rd world countries reduced cost formula, while educating the mothers that it was better for children than breast milk. The problem is that most water in 3rd world countries is tainted such that babies really should not be drinking it. This resulted in many dead babies who should have just been drinking their mother's milk. They are also a leader in buying up and privatizing water in the USA.
On top of all the other issues with baby milk formula and unclean water in developing counties they would give young mothers a limited supply of free formula for their new babies. This had the effect of stopping those mothers naturally producing their own milk which ment the mothers were now dependant on nestle formula to feed their children.
So is beef. I'm not a vegetarian or anything, but beef is by no means a necessity.
It also takes about 2,500 gallons to make a pound of beef.

Yeah, if it doesn't come from CA, it has a pretty good chance of coming from TX. And we're not doing so great with water down here, either.
Lets see.

>Number of cattle & calf operations: 915,000 (2012) 

>   29.7 million beef cows 
>    9.3 million milk cows
>    5.8 million beef replacement heifers, up 4% from Jan. 2014
>   33.9 million head calf crop (2013)
>    The average cow herd size: 40 head

>Value of U.S. beef exports: $5.711 billion (2013), up from $3.839 billion in 2010 

>Top export markets:  Japan, Canada, Mexico and South Korea 

>Top 5 states for all cattle and calves (2015): 
>  1. Texas - 11.8 million
>  2. Nebraska - 6.30 million
>  3. Kansas - 6 million
>  4. California - 5.2 million
>  5. Oklahoma - 4.6 million

So California produces 5.2/78.7 = 6.6% of the cattle produced in the US. The US is a net exporter of beef, but it is very close to break even, so lets ignore exports and imports.

At 38.8 Mill. people in California compared to the total US population of 320.2 Mill. California holds 12.1% of the US population of people.

So your imagination is most likely correct. Assuming that beef consumption in the US is roughly the same in all regions, California would be importing about as much beef as the produce themselves.

**TL/DR: Californians consume about twice as much beef as what is produced instate.**

Source: http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx

**edit - placed a decimal that had gone rogue**
I dunno, CA produces a _lot_ of beef.
They get it all in state. It's the way in n out likes to operate.
California is the second biggest producer after Texas. There are about 9 million cows here vs 16 million in Texas. Both are ridiculous numbers.
You are right. I am almost certain that is a rarity in fast food. Not quite so uncommon in sit down restaurants though. But this is why In N Out is such a good example of the ag/beef water waste. They only serve hamburgers. No chicken nuggets or anything else. Also all their meat comes from California except that Texas locations use Texas cattle. These numbers only talk about  how much water is used in raising the cow, not what gets used in a restaurant.
Wouldn't it be easier to blame an "evil" corporation like Nestle than, say, your little old neighbor Gertrude that runs her faucet for 3 minutes instead of 2?
It's easier to blame the masses who have to go to work rather than the corporations that write you huge checks.

Yet amid all this San Franciscans keep having to vote on a silly "restore hetch hetchy to its natural state" initiative. Thankfully there aren't yet enough idiots who vote yes. 
We can't just worry about human usage though. We have to account for environmental impacts when building reservoirs. Building reservoirs isn't a solution, it's about water management. 
> California lets lots of runoff run into the ocean quite often when there is lots of snow/rain

The "50% of the state's water for environmental purposes" figure includes water that flows in wild and scenic lakes and rivers, in addition to water released from reservoirs. Those "wild and scenic" rivers are protected by state and federal laws from being diverted. However, keep in mind that the Smith River is the only major river in California that is not already dammed, so many of the un-diverted rivers still flow into other rivers with dams on them.

Stored water (ie water in reservoirs) is used for environmental purposes for a variety of reasons, including keeping salty ocean water out of the Sacramento delta, maintaining in-stream fish and wildlife habitat, and supporting wetlands within wildlife preserves.

Diverting more Sacramento river delta water for human use at the cost of saltwater intrusion is counterproductive. No sensible person would suggest reducing environmental flows to the delta is a good idea.

California's rivers already have significant ecological problems due to their waters being diverted. By diverting even more, we must realize that there are serious, permanent, environmental ramifications. If there's a choice between a farmer having to fallow 15% of their land, and a river supporting wildlife, I think many people would choose to keep the river alive.
Plus the fact that humans can't go longer than a few days without water. Electricity, shelter, food, cars, etc pale in comparison.
...No, I think you misunderstand. His costs would be raising to. He isn't getting it for free somehow but everyone else has to pay more.

To be fair one of the biggest things to blame for our drought is the lack of rain.
It isn't really the fault of the government. These subsidies allow our food prices to be low.
Agriculture is big business
The devil isn't responsible for the DMV. 
Well, yes. So is bottled water. They're both bad.
They use as much water as one golf course. There are about 1,100 golf courses in California.

The phrase, "drop in a bucket" comes to mind.
Conversely, almonds are claimed to use 1.1 trillion gallons annually; [source](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/05/_10_percent_of_california_s_water_goes_to_almond_farming.html).

Which is ~~1,666,666.7~~ 1,666,667 Olympic sized swimming pools if my math is right.

Edit: Struck bonus sig figs and rounded up :-)

Edit 2: Ok, so fine. Lets call it 1.7mil olympic sized pools? Does that work better?
It's like people can only understand the most basic thing.  Hey, they're taking *our* water, which is normally free, and *selling* it to us!  For a profit!  You can tell because it is literally water.  

But all the other people buying water for other purposes, no.. that's bad...  Even though that bottled water could be extremely useful if the drought got really bad and people's wells aren't working.
I want to know who's behind the Nestle hate fest that's been going on in the media lately. 
Wow, looking at this makes it pretty clear that these guys just hate Nestle.

There are more than a few reasons to hate Nestle(read: encouraging mothers (who couldn't afford formula) to formula feed their babies(knowing that they didn't have access to clean water to mix their formula) when they could have breastfed with no problem at all.

But this water plant is hardly worth a protest.
In some cases, fracking uses previously contaminated sources of water, after it's done used for fracking, and then cleaned, the water is perfect.

They are ignoring all the cost outside of the water itself as they don't believe that bottled water is a legitimate business. 
1000% markup on a $0.01 product is $0.10, they use percent because it sounds 100x bigger than it is. 
that just gets you one step closer to drinking your own piss

...hope for rain? 
I'm working with a hydrologist on a project right now, and so he and I are in close contact with other hydrologists and climatologists and other ologists who are *freaking the fuck out*. There are no sound models to predict the weather patterns we are experiencing, and no way to know whether or not we will return to normal rainfall. The ocean currents and wind patterns are all far from ideal.
  
We haven't experienced a drought this bad since we started recording snowpack and temps.
  
Agribusiness needs to adapt. Hopefully the government stops subsidizing crops that are not water friendly. We may even stop shipping rice overseas to Japan where it just sits in warehouses and never gets eaten. (http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2008-05-22/how-japan-helped-ease-the-rice-crisisbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice)
  
Basically, we're going to be fine if policymakers react properly. Lawns are gonezo, though. Oh and property values might go down.
why not?
> The answer is simply to let water prices faced by agriculture to rise to market levels and therefore fairly optimal redistribution will occur.

Under California's current system of water rights, this will never happen. People with cheap water have a right to that cheap water. You either have to tax them or take away their rights. There are roughly 4000 individual entities (such as corporations) which have senior water rights to over half of the state's water supply. They are guaranteed by law to receive all of their water at cost before anyone else with junior rights can receive a drop. 

Meanwhile, those with junior water rights have been promised over five times the amount of water which naturally occurs in the state. 

The state needs a plan to make sure that it can sustainably use the amount of water it has.
> Almonds are just an example used to demonstrate the incredible amount of water necessary for luxury foods.

Which is irrelevant for determining what to do. If the "luxury" crops need California's climate and the other crops *don't*, then you relocate the other ones.

> Alfalfa example is also factually wrong. While it makes for a good headline, only a small portion of Alfalfa is actually exported as there is plenty of demand for animal feed in the United States

I'll accept that "almost solely" was likely too strong of a claim and thus, wrong, but the overall point of the mention of alfalfa wasn't to scaremonger about the exportation (that's more to enhance the "less necessary to grow" sub-point) but the low value of the crop and the circumstances of it being grown. [Which are absolutely true](http://www.vox.com/2014/10/31/7135249/could-water-markets-help-solve-the-wests-water-crisis). And it's [not like export of alfalfa is a small thing in California](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-feeding-china-hay-20140609-story.html#page=1).

> The answer is simply to let water prices faced by agriculture to rise to market levels and therefore fairly optimal redistribution will occur.

I don't think we're too far in disagreement on the solution. A link I used earlier ([this one](http://www.vox.com/2014/10/31/7135249/could-water-markets-help-solve-the-wests-water-crisis)) notes the merits of using water markets to help California deal with the drought. I think a solution along those lines is probably the most practical we can implement, and would likely displace the crops that don't need to be grown in California and/or provide little value per unit of water usage.

Doesn't change that almonds (or nuts & fruits in general) are the wrong target though!
Irrigation includes irrigating things like alfalfa that are used to feed livestock.
[deleted]
And yet another report said 47% of water is used for meat/dairy.
70% of irrigated crops are animal feed
[false](http://i.imgur.com/d5yG40M.png)

[source](http://pacinst.org/publication/assessment-of-californias-water-footprint/)
I think generally dairy cows are different from cows raised for beef. Don't know about leather, and it's probably different on family farms.
Actually you normally don't get meat from dairy cows. I'm not sure about leather but you don't get all of those things you listed just from one cow. Raising a cow is not very efficient at all when it comes to water.
Raising cows isn't overly efficient. If you're a small farm with a few cows and you use most of the stuff - sure. Massive farms though, different story. 

Dairy cows and meat cows aren't the same. The water used for cows isn't only for drinking, but also for watering the feed they eat.

Also, cow poo gives off an insane amount of methane. Which doesn't really help.

Though I imagine there's all kinds of other BS things that people won't give up. Like fancy golf courses and swimming pools. It always blows my mind when I see huge pools at private homes that are within a reasonable distance to the ocean / lakes. What a waste. Let's not forget about people watering their lawns non stop and washing their cars.
> more people would care about their local water sheds

In California, most people's watersheds are 150+ miles away in the Sierra Nevada mountains. People live on the coast, which is obviously on the west side of the state, and they get their water from the mountains, which are on the east side of the state.

For example, San Francisco [gets 85% of its water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir](http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=355), which is nearly 200 miles away.

Los Angeles gets [90%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Department_of_Water_and_Power#Water_system) of its water through three aqueducts: the [LA Aqueduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Aqueduct), [California Aqueduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Aqueduct), and the [Colorado River Aqueduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct), which are 419 miles, 701 miles, and 242 miles long, respectively.

Basically, Californians don't *have* local watersheds. Well, they do, but not leading to their kitchen faucet. If they buy bottled water that Nestle bottles in Sacramento, it's entirely possible it's coming from a watershed *nearer* to them than where their tap water comes from.

You're right that disposable containers are wasteful, but that's a separate issue from dealing with the drought.

Brita changed my life! We've been using it at home for about 5 years now and holy fuck we probably saved thousands of dollars by now. Used to go to bjs and buy 4/ 5 packs of bottled water every 2 weeks (Poland spring is like 5$ for a case of 24), now just fill up the pitcher in the fridge, pour 3 or 4 sports bottles for work, throw it in a little cooler with an ice pack and always have tasty fresh water with me.
If you're really a water snob, then at least get a water cooler and order the 5 gallon jug service where the jugs are always reused. I don't get how people can live on bottled water without giving one thought to the environmental impact. 
Meh, bottled water is really no different from any other bottled drink. Are you only going to drink beer during an earthquake from now on?
It's sort of an idiot fad. Probably it'll go away around the time 8-10 year olds start
slamming red bulls 3-4 times a day, and guzzling coffee drinks. 

Then all the fluids will be in saline/dextrose bags because everyone has early kidney failure. :D 
I'd imagine all meat is fundamentally more water-costly than vegetables. Beef is just an easy example. All of our livestock eat plants, after all.
[deleted]
Why are we raising beef in what is pretty much a desert? Isn't there a state better than California, preferably one with more water, to raise beef stock in?
What really shits me, is that here in Australia we heavily subsidize water for the massive beef industry whilst residential consumption is thousands of times more expensive and has a lot of restrictions. You can get fined a few hundred for watering your lawn on the wrong day.

Meanwhile, the trillions of litres used for raising cattle isn't even for our long term benefit. The fucking cows drink all our good water practically for free, then they jump on a ship and fuck off overseas. Where they're sold into foreign markets for nearly the sole benefit of the the beef industry owners.

They're sold dirt cheap and any taxes collected are far outstripped by the costs of all the water and various other subsidies they've received. Meanwhile, you can can buy Australian beef cheaper almost anywhere else in the world, from the cheapest scraps to the elite-grade sashimi of the outback. Wanna try a choice cut of the best wagyu or angus we have to offer? Well I hear it's cheaper and easier to find in Japan..

If all the money we spent, all the environmental impact from deforestation,  pollution, all extreme water consumption it caused resulted in me being able to get half a kilo (1lbs for those still measuring against the heaviest dead rat found found each first week of spring)  of decent enough rib eye to faintly sear on my hotplate before devouring myself at home for around $10, then I'd be cool with it. Nothing too fancy, just fresh enough that the term 'undercooked' is just a nonsensical meshing of noises that sound almost like words before you realize only crazy people try to squark at an imaginary hamster. 

I suppose that the high cost of beef isn't completely undeserved. I mean I had never eaten a steak cooked properly until I made it myself. Everywhere you look in these parts people crucify any cut of meat like it was pork that was left in the car parked outside in the middle of summer for a week after being bought from some very sickly looking prostitute drug addicts that didn't want it because they mistook the foodbank bag it was left at their door in for an empty bag to throw up in after a bad hit they got for some bad head.  Oh and it's possessed by HitlerPolPotBushJnr. Well at least I grew up knowing what a good tasting grisly lamb chop tasted like. I just grew up thinking steak was just a dry tasteless chop with all the good parts trimmed off,I neve realized it was a completely different flavour experience. 
Thank you so much for posting this.  I'm sick of people bringing up the goddamn almonds when meat takes up so much more.
> It also takes about 2,500 gallons to make a pound of beef.

To be fair, most of the water is placed back into the environment. Just like the gallon used to make a single almond. The water that a cow drinks is excreted and then soaked back into the ground. Most cattle are raised in range land. They drink from the available water in the mountains. Cattle are released to range land typically in early spring and then gathered back up in late fall. 

The water that is used in feed-lots is treated and returned to the water supply. Blaming food sources for water shortages doesn't make any sense.
[That number is grossly exagerated.](http://www.megatome.com/2009/06/07/raising-beef-is-not-killing-the-environment/)
Absolutely. I would go to the length to even say that if you eat meat or animal products you can't seriously call yourself an environmentalist. When you look at the environmental impact of meat and animal product production, the figures are truly staggering. 

The drought in California is largely the result of lack of water conservation in the form of people's eating habits. The farmers are going to produce what is demanded by consumers. Changing your diet to more plant based products is the single most effective way you can help to conserve water.

To produce one hamburger requires around 630 gallons of water which is the equivalent of 15 standard sized bathtubs filled with water (42 gallons per tub). Replace burgers with plant based fods and the drought is over folks.
And there are 50,000 people in Palm Springs, and 5,000,000 cattle in California. 

Edit: Forgot, 500 lbs of beef per cow.
I don't believe that last bit. 700 gallons per person a day? That's 11,824,795,500 gallons of water a year for just 46281 people. New York City has 8.406 million people and uses 214,773,300,000 gallons a year. Palm Springs' population is a half of a percentile of the total population of NYC, but somehow uses 5.5% of NYC's total yearly water usage? I dunno man. That said, fuck Palm Springs and I hope it dries up into a dusty cooter.
Doesn't a lot of that water get recycled anyway?  I mean, a pistachio doesn't actually have 3/4 of a gallon of water in it.  The water has to go somewhere.  One would think it would either drain or evaporate back into the water cycle.
Do you have a source on the Palm Springs part?
The difference is size. We're talking about one fucking almond for a gallon of water. You're of course intentionally ignoring the size variance, as though a tomato is comparable to a single almond.

And walnuts? A much smaller footprint in terms of the number of walnuts grown vs almonds.

Almonds take three times as much water as all of Los Angeles uses for residential and business purposes.

70% of almonds are exported. If you want to know where all of California's water is going, it's going to China, which is the largest consumer of exported California almonds.
Palm Springs population: 46,281  
Palm Springs per capita consumption: 700 gallons/day.  
Total Palm Springs consumption: 32 million gallons/day.  
Almond water consumption: **FUCKING 3 BILLION GALLONS/DAY.**  
  
But the worst part is about 70% of these almonds (2.1 BILLION GALLONS OF WATER PER DAY) get exported overseas. Mostly to China.  
  
So good fucking job defending corporate America while they rape us in the ass so the Chinese can have a snack food.
[deleted]
Wait.. How the fuck are they using 700 gallons a day per person 
[deleted]
15 years is peak production, they are profitably harvestable at the latest 5 years old.  
> California holds 121% of the US population of people.

I think you forgot a decimal
Thanks for bringing this up.

This issue is completely global, and we are now starting to feel the constraints of the biome's carrying capacity push back.

California needs to implement changes, as do we all in every part of the globe. 

Our interconnectedness is becoming increasingly harder to dismiss. 
Why can't I find a water bottle that doesn't make the water taste strange? I can't stand metal bottles, the best I've found is clear plastic, but even then you get a plastic smell. I usually just use a glass, though, and have a filter at home.
A filter requires more effort to get, a reusable water bottle is far less convenient.
You're pointing out the difference between infrequent events, and America's absolutely massive daily consumption of bottled water, in every region.  
> San Franciscans keep having to vote on a silly "restore hetch hetchy to its natural state" initiative

San Francisco‚Äôs water rights, and its source of water, are to the Tuolumne River. Their water rights are tied to the Tuolumne River, which flows through the Hetch Hetchy Valley, and then on down into the San Joaquin River and then into the bay delta and the San Francisco Bay. If Hetch Hetchy were removed, that water could still be stored further downstream, in existing reservoirs, or in new reservoirs that aren't in a national park. Nobody‚Äôs trying to take away San Francisco‚Äôs water rights.
The thing is: people NEED water and WILL pay whatever they must to get it. The consumer will be the one to eat up the cost increase. 
The people with the most money would end up owning most of the clean water. May take one year, may take 100, but that is what would happen. Seems more extreme to me to (potentially) put the populations water supply in the hands of a few people.  
Something needs to be done. No question about it. Is this really an answer though.

 
Except Nestle pays little to nothing for water. So his whole "market value" is pure bullshit. If he truly believed in the market value then they'd pay what normal consumers pay for water.
That's how it should work, that's how it never works.
Exactly. Are people in California really going to argue that water has no value in the marketplace? 
Well, there are many ways to do this. I would google, ****solutions to solve food waste**** and then look at this video or vice versa. http://www.ted.com/talks/tristram_stuart_the_global_food_waste_scandal 
Make it illegal to throw out unexpired food. Force stores to send their day old bread to homeless shelters or just sell discounted instead. 
For instance, all your fruit and veg looks nice and regular at the supermarket. Huge portions of it that *doesn't* look regular (might be 1/5th to 2/3rds) gets rejected because the supermarket doesn't think customers will want it.

Not to mention all the food that sits on a shelf, goes out of date, gets thrown away.
If you've seen the eating habits of Americans you would know that this is a futile waste. /s

Ultimately this it's a supply and demand problem. To completely eliminate food waste you would need every food item (potato, tomato, steak, easy mac, etc) to be consumed by a customer. In supply chain production it's a concept called [one to one lot sizing](http://continuations.com/post/61372297/kaizen-for-developers-lot-size-one). You don't produce a finished good until you have demand for a finished good, and then you produce exactly one good that is immediately sold. The above article details why this is more effective than mass producing finished good inventory, but there are problems associated with it. If you have unpredictable demand, for example, food. 

There are 300 million Americans living in the US right now and nearly all of them are going to eat food and a variety of it. Think about trying to accurately predict how much and what kinds of food will want to eat in the next week. It's incredibly difficult to do just because of the sheer number of options. Therefore grocery stores keep a couple of units of food on the shelves for consumers to buy, and a safety stock in the back in case the shelves go empty. Once the safety stock dips below a certain point, a purchase order is sent to whichever company makes a certain product that tells them to ship more product. And when that company's safety stock of raw material is used producing their product they send a purchase order to their supplier's supplier to send more raw material, and so on. What happens is that companies keep a safety stock on hand that tends to inflate market demand, and creates waste within the supply chain.

What if everyone knew what they were going to buy at the grocery a week in advance and told the store to a couple weeks ahead of time what they wanted and paid for it then? Grocery stores wouldn't need to keep as large of a safety stock on hand and would over the course of time decrease the amount of inventory they carried in the back. Then their suppliers and supplier's suppliers would become more efficient as well, ideally all the way back to the farmers, who would still need to grow a large inventory but would have a better idea of how much they would need to plant, thus reducing the amount of water used to grow all the foods. Restaurants would still be somewhat unpredictable, but maybe the reduced prices at the groceries would encourage people to make more of their own meals. Or we could apply the same system to restaurants and everyone plan their dining out events weeks ahead of time...but that's an example for a different time.
Agree totally.  The way the price is set has to reflect reality of the costs of extracting and delivering the water.  When you let a business cost shift it harms all other users.

I think there is also a problem with private extraction, aka, wells.  
Maybe we shouldn't have populated the southwest so heavily considering the high risk for something like this to happen. Californians love to like fun at the east and talk about how nice and sunny it always is. The part they conveniently ignore is that good weather comes with a downside.
The gods are angry at us! Don sackcloth and repent! 
But they also don't directly transfer the real price of goods to the consumer which leads to an inefficient economy. Therefore, foods that aren't as detrimental to water and energy supplies will not be purchased as much as they should in order to lead to a sustainable economy. In other words, when water and energy supplies are subsidized, the cost of a calorie to the consumer is skewed. Therefore, a consumer will consume a calorie that is not necessarily the most efficient economically. 

>It isn't really the fault of the government.

It absolutely is the fault of the government as much as the consumer and corporations. If you subsidize/tax the cost of water appropriately, at which point our water resources are sustainable from year-to-year, then consumer and farmer behavior will adopt. If the demand happens to be more than the supply of water it will spur the development of desalination plants. As in, when water supplies are effectively controlled to last, there will not be droughts. This is the same concept behind the carbon markets in California that are controlling to release of CO2 into the environment (AB32). 

>These subsidies allow our food prices to be low.

The food prices are low since your taxes subsidize the food. The price of a burger that you see at McDonalds is not the real cost.
The subsidies have been a crutch for our farms and enables them to act like a government agency they haven't updated their water/growing practices. Charge fur the water, food prices go up but money from the New prices will help wic and such
California primarily grows 'luxury' crops. Almonds, in particular, use an absurd amount of water and are grown in large quantities there with government water, because almond farmers make bank when they don't have to pay for water. If corn and meat prices were allowed to normalize, yeah, shit would go crazy.

The world can live with more expensive almonds, pistachios, and kiwi though.

Edit: Correction, mostly luxury crops and dairy products. So at least half of it is sort of defensible in a drought!
That only accounts for 2% of the states economy. Let's keep things in perspective.
I live in Sacramento, and all of the golf courses here are bright and green, when we can't even water our own lawns, wash our cars, or take showers longer than 10 minutes. We should let the fucking golf courses go brown, considering we're in the middle of the worst drought in recorded state history.
Too many sig figs. -5 pts
And [alfalfa alone](http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/workgroups/lcfssustain/hanson.pdf), which is fed mainly to dairy cows in CA, drinks up more than twice the amount used for almonds. Add to that the water used for forage/pasture, plus the water that the cows actually drink?

Almonds aren't good for water use, but if you're gonna get mad about *almonds*, you ought to be *furious* about cows.
If I was to look at who profits from this deception, I'd look to the AG industry. AG uses 11,078,948,518,000 (eleven trillion) gallons of water every year or about 110,000 times as much as Nestle. But I see way more coverage of the statistically irrelevant amount Nestle uses (of which 75% is actually consumed by humans) than the astronomical amount AG uses. 

So, being a bit of a cynic, I would not be surprised to find AG is writing checks to this protest group. And it would appear to be a good investment.
Activist groups, sadly.  Bottled water was already a target and the crash of their water problems have made it easier than ever.  Incidentally, I'm not a fan of the product either but I hope to keep an open mind.

I grew up in California and every summer is heat wave, drought, and conservation.  This problem has been going on for decades, but you can always count on leaders to pay no mind to posterity.
Nestl√© is not a very likeable corporation? (And I say this a swiss person)  
Their track record is pretty bad (maybe not worse than other big corps, but I think they got into the media for it way more).
Why does anyone need to be "behind" it? There are plenty of good reasons to hate Nestle.
I buy CO2 to make soda. I buy it from a company that gets it out of the air without paying any fees to the state. $15 gets me all the soda my family can drink in 6 months. What's the markup on that?
It will in time, and life on earth will recover.

Note what's going unsaid here.

I think this was supposed to be a clever answer based on the assumption that the water in the bottle is included in the equation.
He's commenting as though the amount of water needed to make a bottle of water includes the water in contains.  After all, it's not a bottle of water unless there's water in it.  He was being funny, but at the same time, he's right.
Alfalfa that we then export to china.
Dairy cows consume more water than feeder cattle. At a ratio of 1:1.3, if I recall correctly.
Old dairy cows become hamburger. Boy calves become veal. They're not raised for meat but they're sure used for meat.
Most but not all. I live in the Tahoe Basin and I can literally see my drinking water supply shimmering in the morning sun looking out my window right now. A good chunk of people around here have bumper stickers saying "Drink Tahoe Tap" and are active with The League to Save Lake Tahoe. Now I understand that it's a lot easier to get people motivated to protect such a beautiful watershed but I still think if people relied more on their tap water than buying bottled they would care more about where their tap water came from, regardless of geographic distance.
Yes most large cities on California's coast get their water from reservoirs fed by Sierra snow melt but there are still some places in the central valley that rely on local aquifers. If people in that area had a greater interest in protecting those aquifers they may give greater consideration to the zoning laws that allow Fracking Companies to pump waste water back into the ground in such a way that could possibly contaminate that water or also be more concerned about the effects of agricultural run off.
Arguing about water rights in The West isn't anything new and I don't think we're going to settle anything posting on Reddit about it. As Mark Twain once said "In The West Whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting."
Just pouring tap wanter into a pitcher and leaving it in the fridge will get rid of the chlorine taste because it will gas off. But yea, brita or pur filter will make almost all tap water as good as any bottled water.
As a swede i get surprised every time I hear an american talk about their water consumption. I, and almost every other swede, have been drinking tap water our entire lives. 

The tap water costs about 2.5√∂re/litre (~$0.01/gallon). It is almost free guys! Why not demand drinkable tap water??

It takes ~500 gallons of water to raze a crowd of protesters.  
The fundamental problem with water in California is that it isn't priced according to supply and demand. You'd expect agriculture to use too much water when it's priced too low -- and they do.

It's also super cheap to ship stuff to China from California, because so many manufactured goods are already shipped to California from China, so the ships are going back anyway and space on them is basically free.

Result: they farm alfalfa in California and ship it to China to feed to cows in China.
Actually, California is a huge assortment of ecosystems and the central valley is not a desert... At least it isn't supposed to be.  Massive water diversions have caused desertification in parts of the central valley and the valleys just east of the Sierra Nevada.  With out massive water diversions (and normal snow pack and melt) the central valley would be a combination of fresh water marshes, oak savanna, and grass land.  And state wide water diversion projects continue on today, essentially pumping water south.  

The state has been drying out from the bottom up for the last couple of decades and instead of people changing their habits and their practices, they've doubled down in increased agriculture in the south. It's insane.  Every time I see those huge pipes running up and out of the Central Valley toward L.A., or sprinklers running on crops around Bakersfield in the summer, it makes me sick.   And would you like to know which county has some of the highest water use per person?  I bet you'll never guess. 
It's not just that cows are grown in California, it's that the alfalfa and other feed for the cattle, which are all extremely water-intensive crops, are grown there as well.
California is not pretty much a desert. California is pretty much all Mediterranean, even LA and most of Yosemite. 
This mild climate makes raising cattle very easy... In most normal years, californian farmers can raise forage crops like alfalfa year round by using natural water in the winter (via rain, fog, ambient humidity), and pump irrigation in the summer. So usually there's no problem feeding beef. It's these years of abnormal weather and lack of rain that gives farmers the need to irrigate prematurely and deplete their groundwater resources. 
Its not about the beef, it's about the cheese. "great cheese comes from happy cows.  Happy cows come from California." /s
Because a California cow is a happy cow. 
Cause happy cows! YAY
the water that goes into a 1,000 pound steer would float a destroyer, it's pretty ridiculous.

edit:
According to this US government water page it takes 4000-18000 gallons of water to make a 1/3 pound hamburger, so 12000-54000 for a lb.

You just compared a single city of people to the amount of cows in all of California. Hardly an accurate comparison.
It is hard to stomach, right?
  
125+ golf courses
Plot twist: Palm Springs is a touristic place visited by huge number of people who "drink" all that extra water. 
There isn't much in the way of lawns in much of NYC.
Evaporation is the problem and why flood irrigation deserves the greatest amount of our attention.
The Palm Springs part is probably true but misleading since it's such a big tourist town. Yes hotels with golf courses and swimming pools will use lots of water per resident of the city. As an extreme version of this look at this guy's source for Vernon in that article. It's not the residents pushing that per capita number high, it's business. I think we can all agree that agriculture needs to cut back, golf courses need to cut back, and everyone needs to get over having a beautiful green lawn for awhile. 
Maybe don't value the foods on their size but rather their nutritional value and caloric content. 


The statistic is WRONG. That's a cute version of the basic statistic, which measures how much water is required to bring an almond orchard to maturity over as long as four years.
Yeah, trying to compare an almond to any of those things is just plain silly.

If you scale the water used by the size, you find that an almond uses around 3x more water than a tomato (please don't quote me, I approximated the sizes)

And if I wasn't lazy and on my phone at 1 am, I would compare the nutritional value as well, and maybe also the number that are exported. Maybe tomorrow, I guess.

But they are so delicious. I love almonds
You still seem to be missing the fact that we are using several times more water for meat/dairy in California than we are for almonds [one source](http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/workgroups/lcfssustain/hanson.pdf). You can look those facts up elsewhere; the water footprint of cows is starting to be revealed as people realize that even though almonds are bad, animal farming is worse.
Tbh the Chinese environment has been getting fucked over for years to produce crap for us too.
Export jobs to China and they're taking our jerbs!

Export Chinese jobs to the US and they're raping our resources!
Found the arnold palmer.
Thanks. I have corrected that
Good news! You can buy portable glass bottles that are encased in rubber. They're not that easy to break though they're certainly easier to break than plastic. But, at least you're not growing man titties with every sip. 
Once I've filled my bottle, I leave the top off whenever I'm not traveling with it. It pretty much sits at my desk all day, so it's not like the it needs to stay sealed. That seems to prevent any weird smells, as far as I can tell.

As for when I'm out doing things (hiking, biking, etc.), either I've refilled the bottle recently enough not to get a smell, or I don't really mind because I'm thirsty as hell.
I honestly found it's the type of plastic for me. Plastic recycling number 5 does it for me.(Plus it's usually BPA free)
I find that most aluminium bottles give the water a strange taste, but stainless steel bottles are fine.
Glass water bottles are a thing. Camelback and Ello both make them.
> but even then you get a plastic smell

I mean, you get that same plastic smell/taste with bottle water too. 

Honestly though, I don't really care all that much about people drinking bottled water, I'm just more annoyed with some of the logically deficient explanations people are giving me to justify their use, like the guy who spends 4 dollars so he can gain $2.40 in returnables (as an "investment") or the guy who says that getting a filter is too much of an inconvenience when they're sold at the exact same place as bottled water and are 1/10 of the weight. 
I have [this glass bottle](http://www.amazon.com/Ello-Syndicate-20-oz-Glass-Bottle/dp/B00BUTN4P8) and I really like it.  The mouthpiece is also made of glass so there's no plastic taste or leaching risk.

I got mine at Costco, a pack of 2 for $15.
1. Go to Amazon
2. Order filtered jug/bottle
3. Wait

No, the thing is that corporations like Nestle and all of the farmers in California, and pulp mills and industrial processing plants, and on and on all have access to water at dirt cheap prices.  What he was implying is that he thinks it is ridiculous that water is priced as cheaply as it is, especially for industrial/food growth use because it being so cheap allows companies to waste it left right and center AND THEY DO.

Almonds for example.  Nobody in California should be allowed to grow them, IMO as they represent a crazy waste of water.  It takes 5 gallons of water to grow one single almond.  That 3lb bag of almonds at Costco you get for $20?  It took 5500 GALLONS of water to grow that one bag.  That's insane.  People bitching about that water plant bottling water?  One case of these almonds at Costco probably took more water to make than they use in a week.
In case of California he could be paying more than what consumers are paying, if all consumers had to pay were the transportation costs of the water while an outside company paid for the value of the water itself while still bearing the cost of transportation outside of this purchase. 

A huge problem is as a Californian we aren't responsible with paying the market rate of water, rather only the costs of transportation. If we were tasked with paying the cost of water given its current supply and demand, people would be much less reluctant to hold on to their 1/2 acre of grass.
They do, thats the point. The current normal value is extremely cheap. They pay just as much as every other business out there (excluding the oil industry which pays way more). 
"Finish what's on your plate or GO TO JAIL!"

Talk about the ultimate nanny state, huh? _Or_ we could just let the price of water rise so _everyone_ has the incentive to put effort into conserving it...
Those fruits and veggies aren't just thrown away.

Where do you think apple sauce and ketchup comes from? The ugly fruits and veggies get processed into these products.
At the store level, I agree. At the industrial / commercial level, they waste very little. Fruits and vegetables are sorted by quality. The ones with no bad spots are sent to stores to be purchased whole. The bad ones are juiced and pulped. The really bad ones are sent out to be fed to hogs and other livestock. They don't get sent to the landfill, they just get turned into other food.
Lots of major population centers are in areas they arguably 'shouldn't be'. Should anybody live in Arizona or Nevada at all? Alaska? New Orleans is a ticking time bomb. Most of Florida won't survive sea level rise of merely a few feet. Chicago is frozen solid half the year; New York City is barely floating above sea level, and for Buddha knows how much longer.  The entirety of the Netherlands shouldn't even exist right now.

Southern California is no more special or different other than the fact that we fund stupid projects instead of useful ones and act when it's too late.  Desalination is the only way to go at this point, and if we realized that twenty years ago and spent as much money and energy on our water problems instead of useless bullet trains and other nonsense, this wouldn't even be an issue.
>It absolutely is the fault of the government as much as the consumer and corporations. If you subsidize/tax the cost of water appropriately, at which point our water resources are sustainable from year-to-year, then consumer and farmer behavior will adopt. If the demand happens to be more than the supply of water it will spur the development of desalination plants. As in, when water supplies are effectively controlled to last, there will not be droughts. This is the same concept behind the carbon markets in California that are controlling to release of CO2 into the environment (AB32).

A: desalination plants are prohibitively expensive ways to produce water - there's no way farms could generate the capital required to build these without the government subsidies you're rejecting.

B: desalination plants have an awful track record for environmental impact - great, we'd have slightly more water several years from now if the policies you suggest are implemented, but we'd kill most marine wildlife.

The easiest solution to sustaining water resources is simply to consume less water dependent foods. Right now the average US citizen consumes 100 gallons of water per day, thanks to absurdly high consumption of meat, milk and water-intensive crops (in California's case, almonds). There's also a lot of wastage due to various inefficiencies in water-intensive processes, so water conservation is still very applicable to California.
Boy do I have a chart for you. Page 4 - http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/workgroups/lcfssustain/hanson.pdf

Also California is the breadbasket of the USA. They don't just grow luxury crops. They grow pretty much everything, from veggies to flowers to trees to animal forages.


> If corn and meat prices were allowed to normalize, yeah, shit would go crazy.

We should really stop putting corn in everything! Also we should be consuming far less meat...
Where did this "luxury crop" mantra crap come from? Google CA farming, there is a great page that shows this to be false
> That only accounts for 2% of the states economy. Let's keep things in perspective.

I think their point was aimed at the "corporations" part of the comment above theirs -- agriculture is largely done by larger businesses these days. In other words, you'd be "ripping" corporations whether you take aim at Nestle or agriculture.

That's what I interpreted it as, anyway.

Fuck Sig figs
I've also met some folks that are still pissed about this: [Nestle boycott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott).

Most of them are pissed because their parents told them to be though.
The markup of your soda stream is not relevant. A lot of people are rejecting bottled beverages as a business model, especially bottled water. All these guys are asking is that if the average Californian is supposed to cut 30% of their water use, why should they allow Nestl√© bottle and sell such a precious resource. When the do their math they ignore they overhead and simply do what it cost the consumer in a bottle - what it would cost a consumer from the tap=1000%. When I lived on 
farm 6 years ago I could fill a 50 gallon tank of drinkable water at the water company for what some of these designer waters charge for 20oz. 
*Paging the dinosaurs.*
I see.  I was thinking of 'water bottle' as just the bottle.
Most of the alfalfa produced in the United States stays in the United States.  In fact, the closest thing to a reliable source that I can find says the less than 5% of American hay (admittedly, this does count nationwide production as well as hay from other sources) is exported.  The majority of these crops are grown for livestock.  Although, we really shouldn't be exporting something that uses so much water.
[deleted]
Obviously because they produce milk and the water in it doesn't come from nowhere.
[removed]
I drink tap water in every city I travel to. The water in the US is drinkable. People are sometimes too picky about slight chlorine smells or mineral tastes.
We have drinkable tap water, people are just picky or believe bottled is better.
Canadian here, I drink nothing but fluoridated tap water. Don't even pay directly, just municipal taxes tied to land. 

Tap water is safer than bottled water. 
The root problem isn't an issue with our tap water. Everyone has access to drinkable tap water. Our problem is that we have a disposable culture. We're not groomed to think sustainably, and you will see that in every facet of daily life.
Dane here, and I strongly agree. Both environmental and economical it sounds silly to drink bottles water, but of course we also have had good, non-poluted water supplies all our life. 

By the way, I like your water! In some way it tastes different than the one I got, but nice as well. 
Until they're ripe 
0.198129 Gallons is equvilant to 749.999 Milliliters. Pretty much a standard bottle of bourbon. 

749.99 MLs is a little over 17 shots. 

Color me impressed. If you are the average adult male at 195.5 pounds and you drank 17 shots in, say 6 hours. your BAC would be 0.25

it would take you 16 hours to come under the legal limit. 

It takes only a couple of beers to make a child
Alfalfa kind of gets a bad rap for this.
It is generally a filler crop because it is extremely low effort. You plant it once and you don't need to re-seed. When there isn't a drought you don't need to water it if you aren't trying to maximize the yields.

IMO: LA and Southern Cali has benefited for a seriously long period of time [by removing water that should replenish more northern areas aquifers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Aqueduct) and with this extended drought they are just now feeling what should have been a major issue years ago.

This is watching the politics/climate-change debate happen in miniature.
Soooo... going full-on Fallout: New Vegas?
Palm Springs/Riverside County? 
Ooo, oak savannah sounds NICE...
The sad thing is that alfalfa was brought to the US from Australia because it was such an amazing dry land crop.  Then farmers got used to getting a 4th and sometimes even 5th cutting per season out of it if they water the shit out of it and now suddenly the alfalfa farmers cry their eyes out if the State threatens to cut their water.  
Since when is alfalfa water intensive?



It grows when it rains.
You're right. As a California rancher, most cows get their water from springs and stock ponds. People say "Oh, it takes so much water to grow beef," but they don't realize that water wouldn't be used by humans anyhow.
Hey man, that commercial convinced me. 

Clearly, the happiness of cows is measured scientifically, and that the objective goodness of cheese has a strong correlation with cow happiness that has been proven to be causative.

They wouldn't fund CG cows for anything else.
So the reason palm springs has high water usage is because of commercial use not residential use. Your 700 gallons per resident was misleading.
Palm Springs is almost pure tourism built around golf courses and swimming pools.  It used to be known as a place where the Hollywood would go to get away from everything.  These days it is retired folk and gays (nothing wrong with that). 
Yeah these numbers are just being thrown around. 

What is actually important is transpiration volume vs delivered volume, per unit of product. 

This is the efficiency loss. If they're hitting any decent efficiency, then it really isn't the farm's fault (other than being where they are).

If (much more likely) the efficiency is exceptionally low, the issue is the political influence that is the ag industry keeping their water prices low, and therefore efficiency is of very little concern. 

Either way, raising the cost of water to a true supply and demand state, then taxing it a bit higher to fund high efficiency subsidies (to repair the damage already done) is the way to fix it.
I wonder if the state can pass a law about lawns that overrides the green lawn rules that so many HOA's have.
Palm Springs is also mostly an Aquifer, so they are fucking themselves, there is also an Aquifer reclamation project that collects mountain water runoff to replenish the Aquifer (doesn't match the water loss but it's something dammit)
Also fuck Golf; a lame game, and fuck Lawns

There is also a large Agricultural region in the Coachella valley out in Mecca, lot's of Sod grown that is sent out, used a few times for the Super Bowl, for example. and Artichokes and shit.
can i get a source on this? i'd like to see thanks
If you scale them by their caloric content you'll find that the almond uses less water than the tomato. 

What is this arbitrary size value anyways? 

Cotton Candy is way bigger than an almond, does that fill me up more or something? 

Look at it by nutritional value and caloric content, not how big the fruit is...
It is ordinarily recycled naturally, through the soil and water table like all water used on plants is.  Unfortunately, the biggest problem is that there is a physical drought going on and water retention in the water tables just isn't happening.  
Ok fine, more effort to use a filter.

And no, carrying around a reusable bottle is not the same. The size of a bottle of water can vary, it can be discarded and it requires no planning.

I mean if you're talking about somebody who regularly goes on runs with water bottles, yeah they should probably get a reusable one. But if you're talking about somebody who is randomly thirsty away from home, a bottle clearly wins. For me, the latter situation is orders of magnitude more common.
Actually, it makes sense to grow almonds in California. In fact, UC Davis, the big ag school for CA, recommends it. 

What you're missing is that the #1 use for water in California is Alfalfa. They irrigate animal feed, and then feed that to their huge dairy industry, which is 2nd only to Wisconsin. The rest of the Alfalfa they export. Almonds don't have shit on water usage compared to Alfalfa, and other forages grown purely to feed other animals.

check out the graph on page 4 - http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/workgroups/lcfssustain/hanson.pdf
I never once thought about this, I always was under the impression that California is the worst situated state but you're right.
As a Californian I have to say, Sacramento is as at least as likely to flood to death as New Orleans, if not more so. Don't let us off that easy.
Damn you humanity for existing!
>desalination plants are prohibitively expensive ways to produce water - there's no way farms could generate the capital required to build these without the government subsidies you're rejecting.

Ideally desalination plants would not be needed. If you gradually tax water, the economy will adapt appropriately and reduce their water consumption. There is, however, some lower limit that is a function of population, food per person, and basic sanitation. So desalination plants would likely be a last resort, when the cost of water equals the environmental impact and cost of the plant. They're also a fairly risky endeavor.

>The easiest solution to sustaining water resources is simply to consume less water dependent foods. Right now the average US citizen consumes 100 gallons of water per day, thanks to absurdly high consumption of meat, milk and water-intensive crops (in California's case, almonds). 

I totally agree! But this is easier said than done. The average consumer will respond a lot more to price pressures than to social pressure. Coupled with this is ending the Nixon-implemented subsidies for corn and soy, and going back to the pre-Nixon system ([Early Butz for more info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Butz)).

>There's also a lot of wastage due to various inefficiencies in water-intensive processes, so water conservation is still very applicable to California.

I also agree. Utilities like PG&E have programs in place to support these measures, but you can only do so much with current water prices or lack of government controls. There are already energy measures in place for how efficient buildings need to be, the same should be the case for water technology.
> The easiest solution to sustaining water resources is simply to consume less water dependent foods.

This is not a solution at all, as there is no way to implement it. It's basically abstinence education, meaning it sounds nice, and it addresses one person's moral sense of their own actions, but does nothing to solve the larger problem. 

Getting people to eat the foods you want them to eat is neither easy nor cheap. Neither is manipulating the food prices to get them to do exactly what you want them to do through taxes and regulation.
I like the data you provide but holy hell if that researcher uses 'sunset' slide template with clip art I can see why noone in edu/gov work is taken seriously by professional orgs.  Also, "emmiter clogs" is a new kink in my armchair quarterbacking proponentship for drip irrigation.  Damn.

Another thought, unspeakable at every level except when shit really hits the fan, is we stop farming in CA arid zones altogether.  Or move entirely to crops that support the Mediterranean climate in our area.  Olives, grapes, herbs.  Hell, Venice beach passed topless sunbathing, we might as well embrace full Italian.  But noooo. "Cows and alfalfa!  Fuck the world!"
California only produces 8% of us food, agriculture is only 2% of our economy.

Losing all California food production won't result in anyone going hungry.

And lets look at your source, questionable as it is. Note the last page in the summary.  If we want more water, agriculture has to go. He says that's not an option, but gives no reason as to why. Going off the stats, I disagree. 

If we terminated all almond production alone we would gain a 50% increase in water for residents while losing less than one percent of the economic boon.
I lived abroad for a time in S. Korea, the amount of meat they eat compared to us is a stark difference. I believe it's a third less. Getting Americans to eat less meat is going to be harder than healing the Israel/Palestinian divide.
Let prices reflect foods true cost.  People will stop consuming as much meat, or not, but who cares.  Least they'd be paying for it.
I suppose that is another way to look at it. Hard to tell from text sometimes.
In Sacramento water comes from the river, which comes from Folsom lake, which is filled by snowmelt.  It can be treated for consumption or used raw for agriculture.  It is not a big step to treat this water as it is close to the source already.
I would say most are. But you know what else you could be using reclaimed water for? Agriculture and some industrial uses. Don't get me wrong. I'm a golfer. I like playing golf. But, and I say this as someone who lives in a desert and would have to drive multiple hours to play golf... maybe those of us who live in deserts ought not to have lush, green golf courses in our back yards? Maybe we ought to try inventing other ways to play the game at home (like Top Golf) or some sort of indoor course on artificial turf?
Yeah, I'd wager the fig crops are insignificant in comparison to the almonds.
I was looking into this too, and I found CA specific sources! Seems like CA makes about 6-7M tons of alfalfa/year. Now, for export, I did not find more reliable sources than news articles, but it seems like probably 0.6M is exported.

http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Historical_Data/Hay-Alf.pdf
It's manufactured demand. Pure marketing right down to the core. Convince people tap water is gross and you have a market that pines for your product forever.
I'm with you. I think bottled water has made people too picky. I really think the tap water is fine.
And it's completely possible to get used to water that is objectively worse than the kind you've had before.  I moved from a region with great tap water to one with pretty bad water.  It took a few months but like an itchy sweater you can literally get used to anything.   There's only one place I've ever been in the US where the water was actually undrinkable due to sulfur.

I would like to make a modest proposal to solve the water crisis.
Jesus, 4.2 million gallons of water over 12 years?!
Just stick them in a paper bag with a banana peel. Water crisis solved. 
That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about the subject to dispute it.

That's not where their feed gets water from.
That's how they *getcha*.
I'm relatively certain that the state government still has more authority than your housing association. 
They already have.
"more effort".... "no planning". And there you go.
>I totally agree! But this is easier said than done. The average consumer will respond a lot more to price pressures than to social pressure. Coupled with this is ending the Nixon-implemented subsidies for corn and soy, and going back to the pre-Nixon system (Early Butz for more info).

I'm not sure that this is correct. It's very cost effective (payback of conversion within weeks) to use social pressure and education to change people's habits. It can cost about $2.4 to convince a person to eat substantially less, or no, meat, just by leafletting. Greater price regulation of water would be good, and potentially greater taxation too, but this is an option that's not as politically difficult to achieve, and can have substantial impact in the short term at low cost, so we should definitely be pursuing it.
> This is not a solution at all, as there is no way to implement it. It's basically abstinence education, meaning it sounds nice, and it addresses one person's moral sense of their own actions, but does nothing to solve the larger problem.

Implementation is simply removing water subsidies for agriculture.

People are still gonna eat, but most people will balk at the prices for water-intensive foods. Problem solved.
The way to solve the problem is to allow people and business to actually pay the true price of water. Let the invisible hand work its magic and we'd be consuming water at a sustainable level. We could even allow individuals to have their first x number of gallons ( a reasonable amount for washing and drinking) and let the price float after that. 

It's nearly impossible to regulate out every possible area of water waste, but if you allow the price to reflect how precious of a resource it truly is, suddenly it makes a lot more sense to replace old toilets and leaky faucets... And it would no longer be economically feasible to have a freaking bottled water company selling your water out of state.
Or,  here's a crazy thought, stop growing water dependent crops in a place 

#WITH NO FUCKING WATER
True but do you know how much water fish need versus cows?

/s
Hmm, interesting point. Glad you mentioned it. 
I would argue the tap water is even better. Might taste different - you'll get used to it - but it also contains more minerals.

Bottled water is just filtered tap water, with less minerals.
If it isn't something seriosly wrong with the water source you normally just have to filter the water. What type of filter depends on what is wrong with the water. Easy fix!
Isn't it mostly irish children then?

"Roses are red, and ripe for the plucking.

Pick them early, then use ethylene gas. 
Preserve them in salt, much less water needed.
You just pulled 4.2 million gallons out of your ass, eh...

 Move to California please, we need the water regardless of where it comes.
At least you're honest ;)  
the average US water consumption is at around 580L/day (about 153 gallon) according to this site: http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=757  
If we assume that a kids uses about the average water we can calculate it:  
18*365,25*580Liter = around 3,8 million Liters, and that's around 1 million gallons
Actually it's probably not too far off the mark. I did a quick Google search which claimed upwards of 100 gallons per day. That particular site didn't have a break down, but I found a few others that estimated closer to 150 gallons per day so some of that may factor in water used to produce the food we eat as well. 

100 gallons per day comes out to 438,000 gallons over a 12 year period, so approximately one order of magnitude difference. 
South Africa has destroyed itself.
This will create a great opportunity for organized crime.
   Capetown is the first - expect others to follow.    People have little to no friggin idea how much water they waste, especially in the US.  
Why is the average Canadians water usage relevant? South Africa is in no way comparable. 
You mean South Africa's policy of "blame whitey" isn't working out?

> "As part of its long-term response to the crisis, the city is building desalination plants to obtain drinking water from the Atlantic Ocean. But a large-scale use of desalination plants would be too expensive for the city to afford, experts say."

Wait...so they are building insanely expensive desalination plants that won't even meet the amount they need?

It's even worse there then I thought.

Most Governments can handle a drought, but not this one.  Poor planning and stupid people running the country combined for this, blaming climate change is pathetic.

Droughts are part of life, and the people will pay for ignoring policies for the last two years of drought that could have saved them.
Sounds like, dare I say, a bit of a shithole
South Africa was just denouncing Trump's descriptive term for their region and now this. 

South Africa sure sounds like a "food mountain" place to be.
For us in USA, 25 liters is about 6.5 gallons.  For an average American, that is one typical day of toilet flushing.  Imagine having to let the toilet ferment and flushing it only once a day, cutting back on dish washing and spending money on disposable wares, not being able to have a proper shower or bath just a lame sponge bath to clean up yourself. Oh and about a gallon to drink per day.
This is how the hunger games start isn't it
This needs to be front page news. Don't expect this to stop with Capetown. 
Why should I feel bad for  the South African government after the policies they implement?
What a wonderful place seems seems not to be a shithole
The South African government _completely fucks something up again_.  Is it news if it‚Äôs an expectation at this point?

They were warned _years_ in advance about their energy crisis and did fuckall about that.  Shitting the bed with their water management was just going to be the next thing.

I really do like South Africa as I have fond memories there.  Which is why I don‚Äôt appreciate the government _completely_ fucking it up.
They better start building desalination plants now. Better late than never. What's going to happen is the taps are going be shut down for the vast majority, and the wealthy elite will have the water that's left, and be selling bottled for high prices. Already the gangs are smuggling WATER. This is going to lead to mass revolt. 
I bet we as the internet could shame Nestle into funding a revitalization of their water production. 
They need that sign language guy to save them.

By drought...
You don‚Äôt even know why. Bravo. 
Why is that? 
yeah, the economy has doubled in size in the last 20 years, but sure, whatever you say pal.
Shit, if I had brains I'd be filling up bottles of water and selling them as we speak.
Most of the United States has plenty of water.  It is somewhat short in the midwest and southwest.  In the early 1900s there were some magnificent water projects built that largely mitigated water issues in that part of the country.  A lot of those areas have seen massive population growth, sometimes doubling or tripling but we've really haven't invested in water infrastructure to keep up.  That is the problem in the United States.  

Water is a renewable resource and it isn't something that we use up.  You burn oil and you don't have oil anymore, but when you water plants (plants do "use" a very small amount of water by stripping the hydrogen atoms off), take showers, drink, etc. that water is still there and still usable if it is treated.  
The amount of water wasted by commercial farming and companies like Nestle that bottle groundwater makes the water that regular people waste completely negligible. If there was some bit of regulation on those Industries there would be no water shortage, but then who would bribe the politicians?
my neighbours spend 2 hours watering their lawns all summer long, even when we have drought conditions or even if it rains regularly, they NEED to have the GREENEST lawn ever!

When my friend grew up in Johannesburg, a city made in the middle of nowhere with all water pumped in. And they ran out of water and were all rationed to from what I remember 4L water a day. So South Africa being temperate/arid this shouldn‚Äôt be new. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs hot today‚Äù and blame climate change but don‚Äôt confuse weather and climate. This drought has been going for years. (Just trying to put it into context as it not being new) It‚Äôs akin to one of the many factors in the Syrian conflict. (SA civil war soon?) The UAE (or Qatar can‚Äôt remember) is looking into water distillation as well. But one of the issues is how much power it takes. With the already existing rolling brown outs this would be a less than ideal solution for SA.
  
See, for me the issue isn't calling a place a shithole. Plenty of places ARE shitholes. The issue is the president saying it, partly because presidents represent the US to the world and this should be stately, and in part because, given his history with people of color and seeming fondness for white supremacy groups, it just reinforces that he IS a racist.

Sounds like a normal day back when I lived in Detroit.
So I guess I'm the only one that pees in the sink?
In a traditional toilet that would suck but I don't have one. I wash my dishes in a small tub, then do a quick rinse. I do use mostly disposable plates but silverwear and bowls I wash because disposable silverware is only good for flinging food onto my shirt. I take a quick shower where I loofah and suds up first every 3 days or so with a .5gpm shower head. The water that comes out while its warming up goes into a jug that I use to flush my low flow toilet. 4 gallons a day is very doable, 6 would increase my shower schedule!

It's not nearly as bad as you make it sound. I have 92 gallons that I fill up every 25 days or so and I've never run out (though this time was damn close, ALL the pipes everywhere were frozen! No fillups!). I'm not sure how much I use when I stop at a laundramat. Twice a month that probably eats up a bit of the 2.5 I dont use daily.

Feel bad for the people who aren't going to have any running water, not the govenment. Cape Town didn't even vote for the ruling party. 
Why is the government of South Africa even something that is on your mind to 'feel bad' for?  Shouldn't it be the citizens?  The government doesn't need the water, the people do.  You should feel bad for the citizens of South Africa because they are human.  It is similar to someone showing a bit of sympathy toward you when a natural disaster strikes your area even though there are politicians that represent you are doing some fucked up things too.
Nah Nestle's one of those companies like google or verizon where they don't give a shit about PR because they know you're gonna buy their shit either way

Cape Town is going through one of the biggest drought in a millennium. Maybe that is why they are having trouble getting water for their citizens. Or does that not fit your narrative?
>but sure, whatever you say pal.

And yet people don't have drinking water in a major city? Sure whatever you say pal.

Las Vegas and Phoenix have no business being the size that they are based on the amount of available water sources in the area. The cities are just killing Lake Mead. 
Did you just say the midwest doesn‚Äôt have water? The midwest might be among the world leaders for freshwater in a region. They just don‚Äôt use it
Agribusiness wastes 10x as much as Nestle ever will.  Not defending Nestle (shitbag company) by any means, but there are far bigger perpetrators.

My best friends family is from South Africa, they say they will never go back. Sad because it used to not be a giant shithole. 
Isn't there an obscene amount of districts in the US that have water not fit to drink?
they currently have it, there is a risk of running out. A  bit like California with its droughts, or the midwest when the Ogallala Aquifer is due to run dry in the next 30 years.

Its not like things were better under apartheid, where about 10% of the country had drinking water.
Most of the gains have gone to whites and coloureds.

Depends on how you define the midwest.  The further west and south you get in the US the less water there is available.  If you are talking Iowa, Missouri, Eastern Kansas, Eastern Nebraska, etc. yeah there is plenty of water.  
The whole bottled water debacle, at least in regards to water usage is a tempest in a teapot. 

People see stories like [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/27/573774328/california-says-nestle-lacks-permits-to-extract-millions-of-gallons-of-water) and get up in arms but have no reference to how much water that is.

62.6 million gallons of water per year is a lot and they should get fined out the ass for not having a permit to pull it, but growing an acre of almonds requires about 3 acre feet per year. That's 96K gallons per acre per year. 

Nestles bottled water in CA amounts to about the same as used by 700 acre of almonds. There are 1,110,000 acres of almonds in CA that together use 1,585 times as much water, and that's just for that one crop.

Bottled water, while stupid (in a place with potable tap water) is about the last thing on the list as far as wasteful uses of water. As drinking water, even terribly packaged, it's about the most critical usage there is.
They are using a ridiculous amount of water in a very wasteful fashion just to save a couple dollars here and there.  It's not some farmer and his family field, it is giant corporations that use robots to farm and don't care about anything but getting more money.
Do you think that water conservation, or just not being wasteful should be dependent on price or availability? Would you run your garden hose into the street for 24 hours a day if you were not charged for it?
It looked large when I did it in my head, and never using metric it these numbers still confound me daily.

Yeah imagine drinking bathing and washing up with what amount to for some people a comparable about to what they waste in a day. Although what I haven‚Äôt seen much is that in SA they do a lot of rain water collection as well. I‚Äôm not sure how much they do in CT but other places in the Garden Route it‚Äôs pretty common. Mostly coz the tap water is poisonous.
Just an idea. With the racial tensions and socio-economic divide it‚Äôs one of many outcomes that could occur with the catalyst of a drought.
If Obama said ‚Äúwhy do we have Libyans coming here from that shitshow‚Äù, then yes it would be like that. But he didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not.

Did you actually read the article?  They are in a drought that is expected to happen every few thousand years... how is that not a natural disaster?  Has the government not been performing enough rain dances?  Perhaps you could explain how this is "government in action".
Cape Town is an opposition stronghold, they didn't vote for the ANC.
Well, that area of Africa is already in an area of lower precipitation just due to the nature of ocean/wind circulation.  That‚Äôs the case for the nearby Namib Desert at least.
Not our largest city. Imagine if NYC was about to run out of water.
> they currently have it, there is a risk of running out

According to the article, "The city has suffered two consecutive years of severe drought". 

My thoughts certainly echo yours in hoping that the drought ends before the end of April, when water will only be available to residents from 200 collection points across the city, however that does not seem particularly likely.
Sure. They've really stepped it up lately in the mining industry. African countries never have any credit or capitol so they dig mines in exchange for the vast majority of the mineral rights.
They better have a way of dealing with salt accumulation...
Shit that's stupid. Why do some people always feel the need to make issues about immigrants or whatever else fits their narrative?
Midwest is Nebraska to Ohio. That region has the most water in the US. The Great Lakes and Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Michigan.
Do you think Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada are in the Mid West? 
Honestly, why not? Your example is ridiculous of course, but if the supply of water far exceeds the amount being consumed why worry? 
Personally no, I wouldn't be that wasteful. I am just saying when prices are low there is less incentive to save or conserve. It's not an individual issue it's a societal issue.
it's beer math if I'm honest, I derive it from 1/2L (16.9oz) ~ pint
Good on you for admitting.
The DA is a multi-racial party. Why do you want to bring back racial segregation?

We don‚Äôt have a national popular vote for president.  We never have.  I feel like people should know this by now.
If Hillary won the electoral but not popular, you realize that the exact opposite people would bring it up constantly, right? You would never peep a word about it, because you were happy that your person won.  
  
Personally I would be fine with doing away with the electoral college and going to straight majority vote. But most people tend to complain about it only when their person loses.
hence my quotes around the word elected.
But I didn't vote for this. 
Would it be north south Africa and south south Africa or east south Africa and west south Africa. Or southwest africa and southeast africa. 
It is indeed, although the Cape has always been verdant. 
your acting as if water shortages are something unique to poorer places, rather that a reality of geography.
and this discounts economic growth how? Should they have endebted themselves to the US instead?
The Great Lakes are ours.  Keep your filthy hands off.
No I think they are in the south west.
Why is my example rediculous? Beacuse you think that nobody would be that wasteful with water? But you don't think there's any such thing as waste because there is no charge, right? I kind of feel silly to have to explain this but your decisions can't always be determined by cost incurred by you. I am no environmentalist or hippie but as I get older, I personally started feeling a lot more aware about efficiencies and global impact. For example, I get very annoyed when Amazon ships me a tiny product (say some batteries), in a large (14 x 12 x 5 inch) box. It costs me nothing for the shipping (I have Prime). But I think about how wasteful it is to have this box travel by air to get me in two days, when most of it is air. This might not bother you because, again, it's free, but one day it might. Just like one day you might think of water as a valuable resource.
Oh, that's just another actual Nazi around here.  I just come to accept that they are going to be more active and bold on threads like these, but that they are statistically over-represented.  There's no point in engaging them, because they are dishonest.  Just downvote and move on.

When have I said that? Water shortages can happen anywhere but at the same time, mismanaged water resources can cause shortages. 

Shortages can also be mitigated by planning years and years in advance and not doing so, when a population is clearly at risk, also counts as mismanagement. In this case too much water was allocated to agriculture. If they are working on projects now (they're drilling for new aquifers now, that's for sure), it is obviously far too little and far too late.

Look to the [Southwest United States, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_Texas_drought#Prevention), they had a drought and what did they do? They built 69 damns, doubled the number of reservoirs, and changed water practices. That's how you solve a problem like this in a drought-prone region.

It's not the people of South Africa or Cape Town that have failed, quite the contrary, they are conserving an incredible amount of water; it is the government of South Africa that has failed.  
It doesnt discount anything. If they were smart they would dig the mines themselves and keep ALL money generated. They cant seem to find a non-corrupt leader that cares at all about the people, however. They always go the route of doing as little as possible for a small amount of money *right now* as opposed to investments.


Great Lakes = Midwest

Kansas = Great Plains
So which Midwest are you referring to? 
He is saying if water is free we probably don't have to worry about conserving it because there is enough supply for it to be free.
they are depressingly common in threads on South Africa for some reason.
so you want a race based society.

That might be valid, if Drought prevention was the only thing the SA government needed to spend money on.
because isolationism never works. Ever. Its the same reason your electronics are manufactured in china, and why Thames water was owned by a german infrastructure company. More efficient and cheaper.

Unless you want to nationalise the mining industry (and when has that ever gone wrong?/s) you cant exactly stop foreign investors from buying shares in companies, or setting up their own operations on land they bought from the government. 
[removed]
and that explains why trump supporters keep insisting they are the "will of the people" then?
A perfect example of the cognitive dissonance we live in today. Water is discovered in a drought stricken state and people decide that the best use for this rare commodity is to have a foreign company come in, bottle it and ship it out of state. Brilliant.

Screw Nestle and their water privatization steps.

Screw Nestle and their use of slave labourers


 
Phoenix is water rich and manages its water carefully - so much so that it this plant is a literal drop in the bucket increase in terms of water consumption, and even less significant so when compared to water that Arizona/Phoenix is entitled to that doesn't get used (via Central Arizona Project Canal and various forms of water management in the area).

So this doesn't really bother me for one major reason: People are going to continue to buy bottled water anyways, and I would much rather not be transporting it across the globe or country. The majority of the cost of a bottle of water is the transportation of it, generating tons of co2. In the case of Phoenix, which does have the water and the people there WILL be consuming it in bottles anyways, move the bottling locally. It's not as if they are planning to ship every bottle out of the region. 


You guys realize that the amount of water these guys bottle is so small compared to the daily states usage that it's not really even worth mentioning? It was stupid when people when people were bitching about it in California and it's stupid to bitch about it in Arizona. When the state is using multiple *billions* of gallons of water per *day* it makes very little difference what Nestle does.

Reigning in agriculture water waste is the only thing that will make a dent.
[removed]
Could someone explain why this is an issue, other than a dislike of the company? It can't be the quantity. Nestle is taking a tiny amount by any measurement. They're taking less than nearby Phoenix pours down the drain in an hour. 

If it's the idea of selling water, then what does one do when one needs to buy water? Is this somehow immoral? It takes capital to pump, filter and distribute water, whether that water is for pouring down a drain, or bottling. This is drinking water after all, not lawn water, toilet flushing, showering, car washing water. 

Finally, how do you propose to distribute water in cases where tap water is either not available, or too disgusting to drink?
This just in:  Nestle discovers that their employees are 90% water, bottles them.

Considering the top comments are a variation of "fuck Nestl√©", here's some relevant text from the article no one bothered to read:

>The Nestl√© plant would use about 35 million gallons (or 264 million half-liter bottles) when it opens in the spring, or about 0.037 percent of the volume that comes out of the city's plants and wells.¬†

Is it going to be a huge drain on the city? Assuming the numbers are correct, no. Sorry to interrupt the Fuck Nestl√© circlejerk with facts. 
>Company that bottles water bottles water

I get the Nestle hate around here, but c'mon.

Edit: and just as I suspected...

>Phoenix produced about 95 billion gallons of water in 2015... The Nestl√© plant would use about 35 million gallons... or about 0.037 percent of the volume that comes out of the city's plants and wells.
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
so they wanna open up a plant where people can work at, and sell a product that would take up a tiny fraction of what the area actually has, and sell it to people who willingly buy it              and they're assholes for this?
If you don't live in a high-lead place like Flint, Michigan, quit drinking bottled water.

It's not like the people in the desert *need* water. 
I was told when a bottle water company bottles water like this, it actually uses .000001% of the actual water in the area and people are just looking for a scapegoat to blame the water shortage on.  If Nestle didn't bottle this water and sell it, would life be good in the desert?
[deleted]
It's hilarious that people get upset over a private company bottling water.  Bottled water companies actually sell water at a really high price.

Whereas water for residential and agricultural use is almost given away.  Politicians tend to determine the price of that water, which is why we have farmers growing water heavy crops in abundance in California.

If we decided to price public water at even a fraction of what bottled water companies are charging per gallon, that would go a long way to reducing consumption.
There is a book, published in 1986 called [Cadillac Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Desert), which has predicted all of these water issues.

The problem is not really bottling water, that's peanuts. The problem is mostly irrigation, subsidized agriculture and salinity. In short people should not be living in a place like Arizona (or Southern California) in those numbers to begin with. And farming there is completely crazy and a recipe for destruction in the next 50 years.

I could go on about this since I just finished the aforementioned book, but I don't know if anyone will care.
For a moment, I thought we were in /r/nottheonion
Honestly I live in Phoenix and can't drink the tap water as it tastes too fucking disgusting. I buy Nestl√© water by the 5 gallon bottle at home and fill reusable cups and bottles from that. When my 5 gallon bottle is finished I return it for reuse/recycling and get a discount on the next bottle. So this is a net positive for me as the water I am purchasing is basically paying them to extensively filter my tap water and make it palatable here instead of elsewhere. 
I hate Nestle as much as the next guy, but if they funded the discovery they own it, right? Oil companies keep the oil they find.

Privatization would work extremely well IF there was perfect competition. If you could have multiple companies in every local market, the price would follow supply/demand laws. The problem I see is the Comcast effect. Comcast may not be a true monopoly nation wide, but they sure are a monopoly in local markets and the customer pays the monopoly price in those markets.
Once I thought of bottling Sahel water and selling it as an exclusive drink, quite pricy because there's so preciously little of it. It was just an experiment in cynical thinking though, noone would be so monstrous as to actually do this, I thought.
Nestle should pump around McDowell and 48th Street in Phoenix. Plenty of ground water. Nestle could even use the EPA test wells in the Super Fund Cleanup site there.

I grew up in Riverside California. We have very hard water that comes from the Colorado river. It's dropped into the Lake Matthews system and processed for our water supply. My grandfather used a salt system to soften the water. It always had a nasty taste. So we used five gallon jugs of water delivered twice a week. If we didn't need one we left a full one on the patio. I've drunk bottled water since I was a child. I have no problem with bottled or filtered water. I rarely drink tap water. When I do I get a headache.

well worth a read. 
&gt;The Nestl√© plant would use about 35 million gallons (or 264 million half-liter bottles) when it opens in the spring, or about 0.037% of the volume that comes out of the city's plants and wells. 

So, basically nothing. 
Nestle tastes like shit and everyone that I know hates it as well. It tastes so fucking bad.
Is there any way we can just collectively hire a guy that follows Nestle around and whenever someone from there looks at water the guy poisons it.  
Nestle is widely considered the fucking devil throughout Europe for their wickedly exploitive and polluting practices, but here in America, no one seems to know or care, and SOME will even loudly defend it as 'it's legal so stop crying about free enterprise, commie!', 'MURCAH!'.

It's as if you believe those in power aren't serving anyone's interests but their own. A frightening amount of you are obscenely trusting or wildly naive; either way, you don't realize you're being raped.
Nestle is the Comcast of food
Phoenix resident, no fan of Nestle, bottled water is stupid. That said, we have much larger problems with water. For one, we insist on growing alfalfa and cotton in the fucking desert! Saudi Arabia is buying up land and groundwater rights to grow alfalfa for their dairy operations. Alfalfa is a very water intensive crop, in essence we are shipping water to the middle east. 
http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-saudi-arabia-alfalfa-20160329-story.html
We have 350 days of sunshine and we insist on powering our homes with a nuke. A nuke that uses 20,000 gallons of water a minute to cool the reactor. Sure its reclaimed, but isn't all water? Meanwhile our politicians and electric utilities are doing their best to kill rooftop solar. 
 https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2015/12/29/palo-verde-nuclear-power-plant-continues-to-defy-desert/
Sure we live in a harsh environment but politicians and the peoples lack of willingness to work together may prove to be our downfall. 
Nestle needs kicked in the balls.
This has been proven to be a complete red herring.

The issue is water used for agriculture and not human consumption. We continue to hear about this garbage because it fits the narrative but it has been proven to be a completely inconsequential amount of water
So the water was have begun.... 
This is why nestle is the ONLY water I won't buy.
They have the best water. Water from the Arizona desert is great. Nestle is a great company.
Excellent news! Now maybe they can start fracking in that area to make the water even better.
No surprise - Nestle has been doing this in California as well in the midst of their historically destructive drought.

that's not what cognitive dissonance means
Nestle will bottle and sell 35 million gallons per year.  Phoenix uses 95 *billion* gallons per year.  AZ agriculture uses 1.5 *trillion* gallons of water a year.   The bottled water Nestle will produce in Phoenix will be sold in Phoenix, which is a huge market for bottled water.  Did you even read the article, or do you just knee-jerk-react to every headline you read?
Since nobody actually read the article, Nestle is asking to bottle less than half a percent of Phoenix's water supply, far less actually. Plus some of the water will certainly be sold in the state and region, they're not going to ship Phoenix water to the Northeast lol. I know Nestle has done some fucked up things but honestly this is just a headline irrationally scaring people and is actually pretty reasonable.
> Water is discovered in a drought stricken state

This is Arizona not California.  Arizona is no more in a drought than Georgia and has adequate water supplies for over 100 years.

We actually get snow in Arizona believe it or not. There's more to Arizona than a patch of desert that people identify with as the whole state.  We have aspens and pine trees too.

However, Nestle is evil and needs to GTFO.
Here in Maine they do the same. No cost to pull all the water. Our state wants to keep those $12/hour jobs.
Where in the article does it say they're shipping it out of state?  Nestle may serve the local community with their brand of filtered water.
This is by far the most widely misused term in my area of study...

Cognitive dissonance is the psychological tension resulting from holding two opposing cognitions or attitudes.

A common example is an individual who smokes cigarettes yet holds that they are very bad for their health.

You're using the term cognitive dissonance out of context. I don't mean to be offensive, just informative. I see this term misused on reddit a lot.
The water was not "discovered".  Their source is City of Phoenix municipal water.  It's designed to serve the local market, not to ship out of state.  I'm from Phoenix.  I looked at the Nestle bottles in the stores now and they are bottled in San Bernardino, CA.  That is arguably a less sustainable source which is being shipped 300 miles out of state.  If people want water bottling to go away quit buying bottled water.  There are mountains of bottled water in every grocery store.  It has to come from somewhere.
Why do you hate freedom?!
I fail to see what cognitive dissonance has to do with this. Does cognitive dissonance actually mean anything any more?
Bottling ground water in a remote area has nothing to do with a drought.

Sorry.

Now, the fact that we've accepted the monetization of a basic need just shows a cultural problem.

I foresee Republicans "privatizing" city water systems and normalizing water prices to be comparable to bottle water market prices.  AKA  Your tap water being metered in the dollar per liter range.
Cognitive dissonance, narrative and anecdote... Reddit's 3 favorite words.
It's called capitalism, and it works.


We're not California man, our water is rationed very well and we aren't building homes with big lawns or growing tropical nuts. We're gonna be fine.

Also it's rained all week here. Monsoon season lol.
> people

If by "people" you mean "soulless corporations", then yes.
Thats actually happening down here in New Zealand. A few Chinese companies are exporting our water. I say it's greed more than anything. 
> people decide that

I don't think the CEO of Nestle lives in Arizona, so why should he care about those people when he could make more money elsewhere.  We live in a capitalist society, not one of your lovey-dovey socialist ones.

(/s obviously)
The thing that pissed me off the most was the slide that showed that Phoenix used less water from a river than it was *entitled*. The city using less water than they could is a good thing from which everyone benefits. Except Nestle uses this as an excuse to increase bottling there. Fuck them. 
This isn't an example of cognitive dissonance at all. You don't seem to know what that phrase means.
This "drought" isn't a big deal, I've lived in Arizona my whole life and I didn't even know we were in a drought.
Theres a massive aquifer if you flipped arizona upside down it would be a fresh water ocean. Its just under a shitload of. Caliche clay (dont think i spelled caliche right)
Such a smart idea. Those people must be smart in that state. So smart. Man o man. 
> cognitive dissonance 

I don't think that means what you think it means.
And that's why I try to not buy any Nestle stuff. But it's hard to do. They own literally so many brands 
That's not what cognitive dissonance means. Nestle isn't holding two contradictory beliefs. They never cared or claimed to care about Arizona or its droughts. They bought the rights to the water, legally, and sold it, legally, to the customers who bought it legally. 

What do we do? Start a commune and distribute water? Build an extremely expensive and inefficient pipeline and pumping plant all the way to the nearest city? It's in the fucking desert. 


Correct. I don't deny that Nestl√© has some pretty shitty policies, and I understand why people use them as a symbolic example of irresponsible resource extraction, but even if the company ceased all operations tomorrow, the drought in the Southwest and particularly California would continue unchanged. Most water use comes from agriculture.
Also:

* There are 3 similarly sized water-bottling plants already operating in the city.
* Phoenix has a proactive government keeping groundwater extraction at the same level as when the city had 400,000 less people.
* The city is entitled to at least twice as much water as it consumes.
* Residents are the third largest consumers per capita of bottled water, likely meaning most of the production will stay local and save resources.

This is much ado about nothing.
Same with their extractions in California, yet people go nuts over it. It's virtually nothing. 
Phew! I enjoy the occasional Crunch bar -- didn't wanna have to give that up.
Yeah but they own the politicians you elect. So they can go ahead with their scarce water privatization.
Right? If I try to collect water that falls on my property that's illegal, even when it doesn't affect any surrounding properties, is not a navigable stream etc. The EPA still tries to bullshit and bully you into compliance, but a faceless multinational corporation can just come into your land steal your water and sell it back to you.

It's stupid, we didn't invent water, it was here billions of years before humanity existed, to think that some species with opposable thumbs and an unwarranted sense of self importance can just declare something theirs exclusively when they've only been here for ~100,000 years is just the height of arrogance. 
[deleted]
I give it a decade before they find a way to privatize the air we breathe 
Well Nestle's CEO rightfully said that water is a commodity. We may not like it, but it costs money to get it pumped up and in the end towards your home, being in bottles or through tubes it doesn't matter. The whole infrastructure costs money thus water also has a certain value.

Mind you, in the same interview he also said that drought stricken countries in Africa are a different situation, where Nestle doesn't participate in pumping up water at cost.

We may hate Nestle as much as we want but they are unfortunately right. Water isn't for free.
people don't care they just hate nestle
Don't forget that phoenix owns the water rights to the entire salt river basin. Interesting fact, Tempe Town Lake, which is on the salt river bed, is filled with Colorado River water from CAP.
>People are going to continue to buy bottled water anyways

We need to change consumerist mentality into realizing bottled water is bad for both the environment and their pocketbook.
[deleted]
This bullshit is on reddit on a weekly basis.

Nestle is probably an evil giant corporation, but there isn't anything that unique from what I can see. 

They aren't stealing all of our water. It's not even close to a fraction of a percent of daily use.

They are also using it for drinking water, which is probably the most responsible use of fresh water I can think of. They aren't growing tropical fruits in a dessert with it. Which plenty of other people are doing.
It too bugs me when people think Arizona is six years from running out of water when it's just flat out a lie.  They think Arizona is all desert and cacti.
The issue is less how it's used and more where it goes. When it isn't returned to the local water systems it puts strain on the enviornment. You remember that story of part of California slowly sinking and destroying the ecosystem? That's what happens when you don't return to the water table.
When Nestl√© bottles water, where do you think they sell it?
I have a near limitless supply out outrage, I don't have to ration it out based on how bad the bad thing they did was. I'll bitch about big ag in their threads, boycott them where I can, and vote against their interests too. But this is a Nestle thread, and they have earned their hate, I don't have to let them off the hook just because there are people who do worse. That's like arguing that we shouldn't bother stopping bank robbers while there are still murderers out there. I can do both, trust me.
> operate in the interest of profit and share holders first

This wouldn't be a such a problem if we had properly protective regulations and agencies with properly funded authority to enforce them. A free market, capitalist society is fine, but only if regulations are part of the checks and balances.
Isn't that capitalism? Like.. the whole thing the US economy is based on?
> is another example that large corporations operate in the interest of profit and share holders first everywhere in the world and that it's not just a problem with US corporations.

That is literally the point of businesses. 
> Nestle, based in Switzerland, is another example that large corporations operate in the interest of profit and share holders first everywhere in the world

Sooo... like every company in the history of forever?

Shareholders are anyone with a pension, for example a large portion of the elderly. If you want some of the profits why not become a shareholder? NSRGY is publicly traded.

This is a story everywhere. It's the perfect slacktivist facebook story.
>Could someone explain why this is an issue, other than a dislike of the company?

You must be new here. Just wait till Columbus day rolls around.
At least the water I use in my backyard ends up in the same exact place it would have had I let my downspouts just dump it. I am just delaying the process by a couple of days while growing my vegetables. 

Nestle would own the world's water and sell it all back to us if they could. 
> this shitstain of a company ~~sends~~ **sells** the water they bottle all over the world

Profit is the most important thing, not people.


Why would they send Arizona water at phenomenal shipping costs around the world? It's not Fiji water that Nestle sells.
> while this shitstain of a company sends the water they bottle all over the world.

Thereby creating a fuckton of plastic garbage that really isn't necessary. 
Or they send it around the valley like Walmart already does bottling municipal water. 
Wasn't that oregon?
They do not ship it all over the world. That would cost an insane amount of money to do. 
Not to mention, the logic that Nestle uses in the article is a sound practice: Put the water plant where people need the water most. It's going to cut down on logistics and transportation costs (including a carbon footprint). 

The downside though, according to the article, is that the sources that bring the water into AZ (namely the Salt and Colorado rivers) are beginning to dwindle. Almost none of the water available is ground-water. 
And I guarantee when you slap that .037% in a bottle and charge 20 cents for half a liter it is dramatically less likely to be wasted than it would have been otherwise. 
How much are they paying for those 35 million gallons of water?
Globalism at its finest. Let's have a foreign owned company come into a desert region of our country and bottle up water at a discounted rate to sell to China because they fucked up their water when they stole all of our jobs. So China gets our jobs and our water, and some foreign company gets all the profits and Americans get to fight over what remains of water in the Colorado River.

(You call yourself based, you fucking globalist apologist). Keep American water in America. Deport Nestle. 


How do they get it, if they don't buy it or pay someone to pump it to their house?
I get what you're saying but... they aren't taking or keeping water from anyone.
This is the answer. 

Similarly, if you think we burn too much gasoline, great. Favor massive increases on gas prices...
John Wesley Powell voiced similar problems around the time of his survey of the Colorado River. The entire West doesn't have the amount of water the rest of the country has. Too many rain shadows from too many mountain ranges. 

A friend of mine told me that the community pool in a Maine town didn't used to use chemicals. They just drained the pool everyday and put in fresh water. 
I'll believe there's a water shortage in Arizona when they stop growing fucking cotton there.  
oil and water arent the same types of resources. 



We are worried about that. Too bad no other group wants to do anything about it. You even have people ITT standing up for a multi billion dollar corporation that wouldn't hesitate to comer the market on a commodity or sell you a product with the cheapest ingredients known to man with disregard for human health. 

Fact is that nestle is part of the smaller problem. We have a government that permits this madness for money. And a world economy planned and manipulated by private entities in cohorts with these very same companies.

Problem is we can't do anything about it because as soon as we open our mouths the sheep have been trained to fall asleep or not care and go back to living in a debt burdened, corporate lifestyle that breeds more ignorance and corporatism. 


same with nestle and loads of stuff. massive monopoly, they and..like two other companies, run all of the foodstuffs market. 
Why not, if the proceeds allow people to live in the sahel (if they want to). There's already massive migration out of the sahel. It isn't because of Nestle.
Water is extremely cheap. It's quite literally the cheapest thing that is available for sale. 

That's why we don't bother with complex, expensive, energy wasting projects like boiling the oceans.
Finally, a good reason to colonize the moon! I'm sure the cost of shipping big tanks of water from the moon to the Earth will be economical
I moved to Arizona 10 years ago and get very sick when I drink the tap water I believe our water also comes from the same place and is undrinkable.
Nestle has been taking millions of gallons of water on [expired permits for 25 years.](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-nestle-water-lawsuit-20151013-story.html)
california's draught is half farce to begin with though. California's geographical location makes it a fairly dry region, this was compounded by the cutting down of a large amount of its trees which were responsible for catching moisture and turning it into perpetual fog. 

Most of the 'drought' striken areas in california are man made, with water being sent from non-drought areas to be used in industry and agriculture which is the source of its economy after they've consumed and destroyed all their own local sources. They can't stop wasting water because then theyd be broke, so they buy it/steal it from other parts of the state or from other states. 

That being said, there's very little reason what so ever to sell water to nestle for the purposes of bottling it to resell. They dont pay enough and aren't a valuable source of taxes or employment to justify the slick deals they made/have. 
Legit question that I'm hoping for clarity on. 

To my knowledge, Nestle filers and bottles the water and sells a pack of 24 for a few bucks. How is this different than paying the government for tap water delivery to your home? What's the alternative to Nestle?

Thanks!
Are we mad at Nestle for buying it or the state of California for selling it to them? These circle jerks never make sense.

>Irrigation water for golf courses includes surface water, groundwater and reclaimed water, State Department of Water Resources officials said.

You are being dishonest and misrepresenting the facts. You can't drink sewage, but you can use it to water golf courses. 

>having locals drink this water 

they would get sick, and die. Reclaimed water is specifically not fit for human consumption. It's literally garbage, and it is why 'rich people' can get so much of it to water their grass.  
Your article doesn't say if phoenix courses use municipal water like Nestl√© or if they use reclaimed water. Big difference. Also, those rich people drive a tourist industry that brings people to town and gives lots of people jobs. They still use an absurd amount of water, but I'm guessing the 800x is a bit high. 
Thank you, people love to be outraged more at the fact we are bottling water then the obscene water wastage that happens on a massive scale elsewhere. 99% of that bottled water will be used to directly hydrate a thirsty human. Maybe it's not the most efficient system but the end result is basically the main reason we want water. 
Incorrect, for California. Again being in one of our worst droughts. I was in Dallas, TX, sweating bullets last summer. Walk into their huge grocery store (parallel company to Ralph's), and one 1.5l bottle of Arrowhead was $2. For $2.25 (on sale!) mind you, I could get (and I did) buy a 24 pack of Nestl√©...bottled in Ontario, CA. Sweet.
Actually, they did discover the water like "oil." They found a ground water reservoir that was "untapped," purchased water rights for the area from the state and then proceded with business. The problem is that states like arizona cant spend money on finding these water columns because the government has low concerns on spending money on environmental concerns. Meanwhile, nestle can spend money on these adventures and still make money.
They did not have to bribe anyone.  They are buying municipal water just like any other customer.  The City has very little leeway to pick and choose who can buy water.
Don't let your piddly facts get in the way of the blind reddit hate machine.
It is the new buzzword on Reddit. It seems we have moved past calling everything the Dunning Kruger effect. Not sure if people are trying to punch above their vocab weight class or what, but these misused terms definitely come and go.
I was very confused by their wording. Why do people use phrases they clearly don't understand? It just makes them look stupid. 
Most people on Reddit believe everything they hear and read
Assuming they stick to what they ask for, which, historically, they're not very good at. 
>oey vey it's just a half a percent!!

And what happens when that half a percent is what tips the natural reservoirs over the point at which they can naturally recover and instead contributes to completely exhausting it? We are humans, we need water to do certain things. Just because 1 wasteful activity is only x amount of the water being used, that doesn't make it any less wasteful. That half of percent saved now could mean the difference between life and death 50 years from now.

We do not need bottled water in any capacity in the united states. 
> Arizona is no more in a drought than Georgia and has adequate water supplies for over 100 years

The article states 35 year supply of ground water and that once you start needing to use ground water, that it will probably be hard to reverse.
> There's more to Arizona than a patch of desert that people identify with as the whole state

Patch? almost half the state is a desert climate. And its population centers are in the desert areas.
Actually, Arizona is junior to California's allocation of the Colorado per the Compact. The pact was written in the 20's a time of unusual wetness. Arizona has been in a drought for decades.
I'm not sure what you mean by saying "Arizona is no more in a drought than Georgia" but [Arizona is in a prolonged drought](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) and suffering from the same depletion of long term groundwater reserves as California.

> Now, the fact that we've accepted the monetization of a basic need just shows a cultural problem.

Like food? Should we not sell food?
> Most water use comes from agriculture.

People don't get this. On one side you have people denying the drought in California is bad because "it's not like people are dying of thirst" and on the other hand you have people who judge you for not taking 2 minute showers. When the problem isn't with consumers. 

The biggest problems with the drought concern agriculture, a good chunk of our economy. It's using an unsustainable amount of water since we like don't have rain anymore snd that's bad because ag is responsible for a significant part of our economy. 
Yeah but that doesn't fall into the narrative of "capitalism is exclusively bad" that some people love to perpetuate on Reddit 
That's why I find it funny when people say, "Well just get out and vote!" especially now with superpacs being able to anonymously ~~bribe~~ donate to candidates. They are *all* bought and paid for before they even get into office.

If enough people boycott Nestl√©, they won't have enough money to buy politicians.
Also folks still buy Nestle products. They own A TON of brands, and absolutely nobody cares about the downsides of buying a Nestle owned brand.

Guys, if you didn't buy their shit, they wouldn't be able to fuck us all over. 
Y'all should just elect me. There is no reason why a politician can't go to his people for every vote of importance to gauge response. We have the technology.
Dam, where do you live that it's illegal to collect rain water?
Your problem is with government, not with Nestle. Nestle is buying water rights from government. The reason you can't collect rain water or have limited rights to the water on your property is because of government.
Well in this case they are buying the water, treating it even further, and the selling it back. Not really seeing the problem?
Thanks.Just fixed it. 
I foresee a spaceballs-like future.
As the air quality decreases... this will absolutely happen. Not necessarily by Nestl√©, but it won't be for a lack of trying on their part.

The "cans of fresh canadian mountain air" being sold already are mostly novelty items, but this will change.
Reagan predicted it! He once said "The government would tax you for the air your breathe, if they could figure out how."

But seriously, that was basically the carbon trading market that Gore set up a few years back.
That's odd; the City of Tempe says much of it comes from the [Salt River](http://www.tempe.gov/city-hall/community-development/tempe-town-lake/how-town-lake-works/town-lake-water-quality) now.

>The 2004-2005 flood event and subsequent flood events along the lower Salt River had a profound effect on Town Lake water operations and lake water management practices. Prior to this period the channel upstream of Town Lake was generally dry and the lake received little to no inflow from the ephemeral Salt River channel. All water required to maintain lake levels was delivered by outside sources through the SRP canal system or from Tempe‚Äôs seepage recovery wells. Since this flood event in 2005, and subsequent flood water periods through 2010, the river bed has remained saturated and the lake receives almost constant inflow from the various water sources contributing to the Salt River upstream of Tempe. These variable inflows from upstream water sources now constitute the single largest source of water for Tempe Town Lake each year since 2005. 

And [reclaim water:](http://www.tempe.gov/city-hall/community-development/tempe-town-lake/fast-facts-coloring-book-slideshows-and-videos/town-lake-fast-facts)

>Water to keep the lake full comes from reclaimed water, recharge and recovery and water exchanges
> Phoenix uses 95 billion gpy.

And that's just the Phoenix, which is mostly residential water usage. The big user is agriculture which uses...wait for it...[1.5 *TRILLION*](http://www.azwater.gov/AzDWR/PublicInformationOfficer/documents/supplydemand.pdf) gallons of water annually. So with that in mind...who gives a flying fuck what Nestle is doing with their bottled water.
Most golf courses use reclaimed water from sewage treatment plants.
Yeah I mean if it were practical to ship it, Illinois would have a huge export. haha
I can't believe people still pay for bottled water.
Exactly. It's not like taking water out of an aquifer is going to prevent it from raining or something. Plus now people can actually *drink* that water, instead of it going unused. People are so quick to be outraged.
The article even says its to cut down on transportation costs (presumably transportation to Arizona and nearby areas).
I thought nestle got shit on for their unethical labor practices?
Phoenix tap water is also terrible and undrinkable.  
They also assume that Nestle is stealing water by bottling it and selling elsewhere. The reason why Nestle is bottling everywhere and hitting the news so much is because they are bottling locally for local markets so that they can save on shipping costs.
They're not giving it away, and not for relatively cheap.
Yeah, but the reason we're not six years from running out, is we used to not let companies like Nestle waste it.  With this change in direction, we'll likely get there soon enough.
They probably sell it in the Southwest region, honestly. They already have 29 bottling plants so it wouldn't make sense to ship Southwest-bottled water to regions elsewhere, though maybe the Southwest region is a good hub for international distribution.

As uacoop said the amount they are using is extremely negligible, and the water probably goes to the people in the region. Seems fine to me.
It literally doesn't matter. It's such a small fraction they could send all their shipments to the moon...everyday....for a thousand years and it still wouldn't matter at all.
Arizona. Like the article says they will.
> where do you think they sell it?

They will be selling it in the region. The purpose of building a plant down there is to save on transportation costs.
The problem is that, as exactly what happened already, these corporations simply buy up or staff regulating agencies with their own people.
I don't really understand why more people don't question the fundamental concept of incorporation. People seem to think that capitalism = corporations. But all capitalism means is a society where trade and industry are controlled by private interests for profit and not the state. How does that imply that the state must create a legal construct whereby people can create an avatar that acts on their behalf within the market and bears the burden of liability and responsibility? 

Imagine the concept if done for any motive other than profit. Let's say I think it would be fun to create a lake of fire and poison in my back yard. Not for profit in any way. Just sounds enjoyable. How would you feel if I suggested the government should allow me to create a limited liability entity to bear the responsibility for any harm caused by my hellpit? So that when it causes a forest fire and poisons the groundwater I can direct all complaints to Death Lake LLC.

But if I want to mine for coal and accidentally end up creating a disaster of a similar scale, I can do just that and no one blinks an eye. The corporation pays a fine or declares bankruptcy at worst and people lose some or all of the money they put into it explicitly but still often walk away with more than they had before they started. 
The Swiss are quite greedy for such a small country.  But then again, most of the native population is well-off, and they will absolutely steal from whomever they can in order to keep the facade going.
Its so frustrating to watch people repeat completely false nonsense. 


This is a prime example of people taking what someone said and then imaging what they personal think it means rather than just taking it at its word. Its really a plague across reddit. People can't just read something and accept it. There has to be some other implication or 500 page backstory that means something completely different  than what was said. 
Water is heavy and cheap. It's probably very uneconomical to ship it halfway across the world in volume.
> sell to China

Why in the fuck would they pay to transport bottles of water to China from Arizona? This water is definitely going to stay in America.
There's a huge price difference between paying your local Public Water System for water and paying a bottler for the same water.

Public tap water in the US costs an average of $1.22 per gallon. And in most cases, bottled water is no better or even worse than tap water. Bottled water often comes from metropolitan systems. The bottler takes the tap water, runs it through a couple of filters to make it taste better, bottles it and sells it to you for a 300% markup. And bottled water goes through *much* less testing than water from your public utility.

Source: 23+ years in the water regulation and testing business.
New England is a very wet place. There's not much pressing need to conserve water in a wet, lightly populated rural state like Maine.
Exactly my point, it makes no fucking sense to move water for hundreds of miles just to grow cotton in the desert.
We are not 'standing up for a multi billion dollar corporation', we are standing up for facts. Nestle is using a minute fraction of a percent and adding jobs to the region. They've done some terrible things before so they can go fuck themselves. But I don't see a problem with this particular action.
Yeah good ol oligopolies. 
> Water is extremely cheap. 

Because it is plentiful... however, don't let that turn off the circlejerk that this incredibly cheap substance is also utterly scarce somehow
>Water is extremely cheap

Depends on where and when. Are we talking Phoenix, AZ or Seattle, WA? During times of scarcity, you can't afford to not have water. Creating more energy efficient ways of recycling and claiming clean water is a must. 
So bottling water out of the desert isn't complex and a waste of energy?
Look into San Diego  they have a desalination plant
Nestle has a [dubious history](http://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6?op=1) where people are concerned period.
who needs permit when you got politicians in your pocket
[Not to mention using child slavery!](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/nestle-admits-slavery-thailand-while-fighting-child-labor-lawsuit-ivory-coast) (May not be the best source but I'm on my phone) 
Nestle has been allowed by the state to take all the water they want to the entire time. Nothing nefarious here just shitty state officials allowing stupity to continue for decades. Can't really demonize a complete amoral company for asking to take something and the people in charge saying 'sure go right ahead' . 
That's insane!
But the BLM'll send out a federal goon squad after a rancher with expired grazing rights.
This happens because all Nestle executives are worthless pieces of dog shit.
Dammit why does Nestle have to make really yummy stuff!?!?! 
This is incorrect, and doesn't properly account for where most of the state's water comes from. A large part of the problem is that states northern to us are growing in population, and therefore taking a larger part of their share of the Colorado River water which feeds into many of our key reservoirs and aqueducts. Previously, we got away with grossly over-harvesting because we were picking up the leftovers from Nevada and other states, whose populations couldn't possibly use their whole allocated amount. But the agreement is long in the tooth, and needs to be reevaluated, because other states are getting closer and closer to capping out each year, and they technically have first right. That, compounded with and lowered rain and snowfall (anecdotally, mammoth was a patchy joke of a ski resort all season last year) that does exist create a problem, made worse by inefficient agricultural usage (California is actually *very* good when it comes to water efficiency by the public).
That 24 pack for a couple bucks is around a nickels worth from the tap.
the production of those few gulps in bottles requires up to 10 times the amount of water you end up with
The answer is both.
It's not like you can't do both.
[deleted]
Nestle hasn't had a permit in 25 years, I would say it falls on both.
For California/Arizona *allowing* water to be sold to a corporation and, in turn, shipped elsewhere when the inhabitants of the region are being hammered with the costs of water conservation. 
Can I be mad at the people who buy the water? 
This, complaining about Nestle pumping up a bit of water which is legally sold to them and ignoring the massive farmers. Who in the right mind plants rice and other high water usage vegetation in that region. Nestle of course can't be ignored but that isn't even a drop on in the bucket, it's the general farming that goes on in California that's a big problem.
A lot of the courses in Phoenix are fed from CAP (Colorado River).

Well is there a better use for drinking water than being drank? Isn't that the whole point?
So that's a thing
Is this mostly an environmental thing? are there sustainable ways to golf?
Unless you give a percentage of the water which is potable, you are being just as misleading.
[deleted]
I'm sure the bottling operation also provides jobs.
I think the problem a lot of people have with bottled water is the fact that there is so much waste produced from the plastic left over, creating pollution because many people forget to recycle. Add to that the huge increase in price of water the smaller the bottle you put it in, and it adds up to make very little common or economic sense to buy bottled water except in the event of emergency or other limited uses. Using refillable bottles (large and small) and installing water filters at home seems to be the best course of action we can take to limit this impact on the earth.
Someone send in Daniel Craig.
> They found a ground water reservoir that was "untapped," 

Nope, this plant is using City of Phoenix municipal water. They are buying water from the city just like any other local business.
[deleted]
Wow. Consider me corrected. Did I miss that in this article or did you find that from some other source? If they own the land and the water rights why was this even a state issue? Was the PowerPoint slide made from the campaign to allow Nestle to lease the rights? Is that how this worked? 

I wonder if I can buy land with a well and get my own water rights secured for the future when dirt hits the fan.


edit:
I'm gonna need a source, as I said in another post, before I had access to the computer to edit this one. I'm not thinking this is correct information.
Why does Nestle bother with this sort of stuff when they could open the plant in a state with plenty of water, like along the Mississippi?
Then why does this slide exist? 

https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibLM9LR4W8LE/v0/-1x-1.png

Also, you say they are buying municipal water. Some other poster above says they found their own groundwater.

WTF?
Your epidermis is showing.  Matriculate it away before you embarrass your solvency.
It just means "stupid" now. 

A guy in one of those weather threads started on about how dumb liberals were for calling hot days evidence of global warming, and not calling cold days evidence of global cooling.

I responded something along the lines of "There's no cognitive dissonance there. Both extraordinarily hot AND cold days are evidence of climate change because they're both extremes"

He responded with ~"YOUR'E THE ONE WITH COGNITIVE DISSONANCE! CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T REAL!"


That makes sense. I saw someone use it incorrectly in another sub earlier today and thought it was odd, but didn't feel compelled to point it out.

I think what happens is someone reads something, looks it up, thinks they understand it, then applies it where it may very loosely fit. Another person improperly infers the wrong definition, uses it, and spreads incorrect usage. 

And then reddit users believe they understand what "Cognitive dissonance" means. When someone comes along and corrects them, they retort with "The meaning used to be more strict than it is, but language is fluid and this is now how we use it."
Remember when everything was a fallacy? You couldn't tie your god damn shoes without one being cited to you. (Go ahead, you assholes)
Hey, that's an ad hominid attack you're using there buddy.
You must be new here. They've had a hardon for cognitive dissonance for years.
That's a bit harsh don't you think? It should be ok to try something without knowing completely if it's correct, especially when it's as harmless as speech.
Hmm, yes, shallow and pedantic.
>This is probably an unpopular opinion but I feel like not everything should have a price tag thrown on it. Maybe save that water for a good purpose, instead of bottling it and making people pay for it? Again, probably an unpopular opinion since literally everything and anything is a commodity these days. 

Lol Nestle is bottling like a tenth of one percent of Phoenix's water. To put that in perspective, for someone who is making $50k a year this is $18 worth of their income. $1.50/month. You telling Phoenix to save the water instead of bottling it is like me telling you to save the money you were going to spend on McDonalds value fries instead of eating a snack. It is very negligible.

Besides, this adds 40-50 jobs and probably improves the availability of bottled water in the region... probably worth $1.50/month level of percent.
[deleted]
How is bottled drinking water not a good purpose? There is huge demand for bottled water in Phoenix, which is where it's being sold.
Not Bernie, not Gary Johnson, not Jill Stein. I'm sorry but the majority of people have one person to blame for corrupt people being in charge of the government and that's themselves. For being so unimaginative and restrictive by voting for the lesser of two evils for decades instead of going to the other sources.

Anyone who is reading this probably isn't even really the issue. It's all the people who will never be exposed to the ideas I just blurted that perpetuate this system.

If our campaign finance system needs anything its transparency so I know who to avoid.
But you still need to vote. That's just the minimum a citizen can do. Third party, write in, whatever.
Wall Street also has a lot of influence. 
Canal street has bootleg DVDs 
Problem is I bet the average person doesn't know or remember exactly which brands are Nestle. Sure they may consciously avoid brands that actually say Nestle but they may still be buying Gerber baby food, California Pizza Kitchen pizzas, and L'oreal brand soaps. Heck, even the bottled water aisle has multiple Nestle products under other names. Someone may refuse to buy Nestle water but they still might buy Ozarka or a local looking brand like Deer Park or Arrowhead. It would be nice to have some sort of large colored sticker that let people know when 1/3 of the products in their stores are owned by one corporation. 
I don't buy Nestle anything anymore. When I'm shopping I discuss what Nestle is doing with other customers. Some care, some don't but I'm still getting the word out.
Like the referendum in Britain 
Yes there is: the people are fucking retarded.
[State laws on rainwater harvesting](http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/rainwater-harvesting.aspx)
GE sells home water and air filtration systems and has [a history of polluting waterways](https://www.google.com/search?q=GE+pollution)

3M sells air and water filtration systems, also has a history of industrial pollution.

Same for [Honeywell, who the EPA says are the most prolific polluters in the united states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell#Environmental_record). They sell air filtration systems.

Funny how we by and large wouldn't need these things if it weren't for the companies selling them.
It's honestly been awhile since I was told that, so thanks for correcting me. 
The thing is, it's not the fact that we use that much, it's the fact that we need every drop. Arizona not only supplies Arizona with water, but also most of California and a lot of Nevada. 35 million gallons may not sound like much, but it's a lot when you're in a drought. 
[deleted]
Maybe. They also apparently convinced poor African mothers to use their baby formula instead of breast milk and it caused all sorts of health issues for a generation.

I don't know what exactly happened... But i do know that this water issue is blown up nonsense.
Definitely not. But you'd have to dump capitalism on its head to stop them from making money selling stuff.
[deleted]
Exactly, this is a situation where corporate and environmental interests are aligned. Nestle makes more money be saving on transportation costs, and the environment is helped by not having the CO2 costs of shipping water. I mean it would be better if everyone didn't use bottled water, but this is better than shipping it from 1000 miles away
This is the sad truth, they essentially write their own regulations and are so large as to absorb the costs while smaller competitors get forced out.

This is a cronyism problem.
[deleted]
They're well off because they operate as a complete free market economy. Just like Singapore, they have become immensely successful despite their small size because of finance and global trading.

It has nothing to do with your idiotic stereotypes or fallacies 
>And in most cases, bottled water is no better or even worse than tap water. 

23 years in water regulation and testing, never tasted a drop of Phoenix tap water.  It's disgusting.
> Public tap water in the US costs an average of $1.22 per gallon.

I think you mean bottled. Average tap water from the sink is $0.004 a gallon.
Yeah, but couldn't the people who want cheap water buy it from the Public Water System and people who want it in a fancy bottle with a slight flowery taste get it from Nestle?

>Public tap water in the US costs an average of $1.22 per gallon.

Is water in my town really 1/100 of the average cost? That seems odd.
but... Nestle!
All of that is true but Nestle is only looking to use 0.0037% of the city's water supply. That's a rounding error. 

If we want to raise the price of water, go for it, but it's silly to blame Nestle for Arizona's water shortages.
> During times of scarcity, you can't afford to not have water.

So don't make giant urban areas in the middle of the dry desert which can't sustain them...
In Phoenix, people pay $30 to use 9,000 gallons of water per month. That includes the cost of infrastructure, transportation, etc. 

That's $0.003 per gallon or $1087 per acre foot (326,000 gallons). 

In San Diego, the from water desalination plants cost around $2000-$2500 per acre foot BEFORE you transport it anywhere.[source](http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25859513/nations-largest-ocean-desalination-plant-goes-up-near) 

So yeah, desalination costs too much. 
Yes and it costs a fortune. 

> Almost every discussion about desalination begins and ends with cost.

>Desalinated water typically costs about $2,000 an acre foot -- roughly the amount of water a family of five uses in a year. The cost is about double that of water obtained from building a new reservoir or recycling wastewater, according to a 2013 study from the state Department of Water Resources.

>And its price tag is at least four times the cost of obtaining "new water" from conservation methods -- such as paying farmers to install drip irrigation, or providing rebates for homeowners to rip out lawns or buy water-efficient toilets.

>"We look out and see a vast ocean. It seems obvious," said Heather Cooley, water director for the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Oakland. "But it's cost prohibitive for most places in California."

Nestle should be banned from doing business in the US.

The stupidity is coerced, they're both to blame.  
With the addition of 24 bottles that don't degrade
Work harder!
The drinking water system feeds all the taps in your home. You drink, cook, and wash from the same system. The water you don't drink goes down the drain. Waste water recycling reuses the water that went down the drain for a second purpose, usually landscaping.
/r/ofcoursethatsathing 
It's just a joke really.
It's not one or the other. Nestl√© is taking water locals already have, putting it in plastic bottles and then charging a lot for it. And it only gives a couple dozen people jobs. If i lived in Phoenix I'd buy a canteen and have all the delicious water i want. I'm assuming it is delicious since people are willing to buy it as nestle purelife. 

It's more than just tourism. Think of all the snowbirds that live there so they can play golf all winter.

Ahh yes the plot to quantum of solace.  You know the plot of a movie is captivating when it's the Bolivians tap water bond is trying to save. 
Daniel Day Lewis?

He seemed to have the whole oil thing down so why not water?
Sucks to be whoever gets that water then. Phx water is notoriously nasty tasting.
Where do they ship and sell this water? 
That water tastes like shit. They must be filtering it.
I might be more upset that a facility that size is only creating 40-50 new jobs.  
No good....someone bigger will just drink your milkshake....he'll drink it up.
> If they own the land and the water rights why was this even a state issue?

-----
Land and subsurface-mineral rights can be separated, but in this case, they were still tied together.Regardless of the ownership of the property, this would be a state issue given their policy over water conservation and because the state can exercise eminent domain over: "Reservoirs, canals, ditches, flumes, aqueducts and pipes, for the use of a county, city, town or village, or its inhabitants, or for public transportation for supplying mines and other industrial enterprises, farms and farm neighborhoods with water for irrigation, domestic and other needful purposes, and for generating electricity." Moreover, "Nestle Waters will spend $35 million to revamp a west Phoenix warehouse into a plant treating city water and selling it as Pure Life brand bottles." The City takes issue because they can stop this in its tracks through environmental law, property law, or municipal law; Or they can tax the manufacturing/production facility and boast about creating tons of jobs (but really only 40-50) during the next campaign cycle.
 

>Was the PowerPoint slide made from the campaign to allow Nestle to lease the rights? Is that how this worked?

-----

This Powerpoint slide was from the city's June 10th presentation given in response to citizens raising concerns to city council and trying to reason that Nestle's bottling will amount to 0.035 billion gallons in the first year, while Phoenix produced 95 billion gallons. Part of the debate is that Nestle will continue to grow and expand operations, as they've done at other bottling sites, and will eventually impose an environmental-social cost to the city that far outweighs the short-term tax revenue gained by the City of Phoenix. The City's argument is that whether the water flows through the tap and reaches the Phoenix market, or whether it is bottled and sold to the Phoenix market, makes little difference as long as the Phoenix market is still the recipient of that water. This is flawed thinking because we know that Nestle, despite what they might say, is not going to bottle the water in Phoenix and only sell that water to Phoenix residents for the life of the plant's operations. That is the important takeaway--that at some time in the future, other places outside of Phoenix, Arizona, and the desert southwest will likely be receiving bottled water from Phoenix's water sheds/rivers and groundwater storage reservoirs. 
Private property rights have run amok and people have been brainwashed to believe in the sanctity of private property rights.

That water should be a non-privatizable public asset due to it's necessity in stabilizing the society.
They are not using ground water. There are well restrictions in Phoenix all the way down to Tucson. There are other parts of the state where foreign companies are buying land to grow crops, in that instance the milkshake rule is in full effect
Transportation Costs.
The people who say they found their own groundwater are simply incorrect.  I'm from Phoenix and have read several articles that state basically this: 
"Nestle Waters will spend $35 million to revamp a west Phoenix warehouse into a plant treating city water and selling it as Pure Life brand bottles, city and company officials said."
That slide seems to indicate that the Phoenix water supply (Salt and Verde rivers) can support the additional usage by the plant.
I call it the retardation effect. Articulation of the repatriated verbiage ceases to maintain coherence when the user has been brainwashed by a hivemind of pseudointelligence. If Redditors were protagonists, they would rarely display bildingsroman, and their communication may as well be lorem ipsum.

Even if climate change weren't real, that _still_ wouldn't be what cognitive dissonance is.
Wait... OK, so wikipedia tells me:

>In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, performs an action that is contradictory to one or more beliefs, ideas, or values, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.

So in this situation, someone experiencing cognitive dissonance would say "There is no climate change because we have really cold days along with really hot days."

Is this correct? I'm honestly confused. I can think of other examples  to fit cognitive dissonance, but not in this situation. 
That's what happened to the word inception after the movie came out
Dude, you are using triplethink
I am new here. Where are we?   
Personally, if I'm even unsure of ANYTHING I'm about to type, I open a new tab and google it.
Though buying it from Nestle for sure wont be cheaper than going through the city.
We tried it in Europe with privatizing water utilities. Cost increased, service decreased.
Is Jill Stein still running? Will she be an option for us in November? Now that Bernie's out, she's my next choice. 
Because like you, everyone focuses on the presidential elections and misses the midterms.

Congress runs this country, not the president.
Products say on the back of the label under the ingredients if they're made by nestle. It's not exactly front and center on the packaging, but still easy to find if you're looking for it.

[BNL! Buy N Large, Your Very Best Friend!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIq0F3sZQFw)
GE doesn't just have a history of polluting waterways. Look up their history with the Superfund program.
Yeah they really did that, but it was like 20 years ago. They haven't done anything near that level of evil since. Not that it makes it okay or anything, but they do seem to have seen the error of their ways 
Whatever sector they exist in, aging institutions generally need their reset button hit once in a while.
Great idea but tell that to the people that live there
Nestle should be banned from existing, globally. Their assets should be seized and used to reimburse their victims.
God imagine how many brands would disappear if Nestl√© was banned, that fucking monster owns like half of the food on super market shelves, and almost none of it is good. 

For reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands

What's keeping politicians from taking bribes? They afraid that big corporations will take the "plata o plomo" approach and murder them or are they really that easily corrupted by money?
no capitalism is perfect and corporations are blameless creatures

this is all thanks to there being a state to corrupt. Trust me, this kind of crap wouldnt happen if rich people didn't have to invest billions of dollars into politicians and armies of lobbyists over the course of many decades before they got to have their way
I don't know what I expected. 
I Drink Your Poland Spring.
Thus the additional filtering.
Most of it will be sold in the state. The company was previously "importing" water to sell.
Thank you for the great answer. I hope everyone else reads this far down.
As opposed to 'nationalizing' the water supply and then intentionally creating drought regions as we siphon all the water from one region and then give it to businesses and industry else where like they do in california? Protip: that doesn't work either. 

People should own what they have and use it effectively, rather than just throwing money at the problem and permanently ruining the environment for short term gain. There has to be reasonable limits on agriculture and industry, or alternatives need to be researched and deployed to address the water problem. People who haven't ruined their water sources shouldnt have it stolen from them in the name of some childish concept like "for the good of the people" when we all damn well know where its really going.  
And food production presumably isn't necessary to "stabilizing the society", despite the entire industry being privatised.
Thanks. You are correct.
Right, and if they had found an untapped source of ground water they wouldn't need such a slide as they'd be pulling from their own well. So I really don't believe they have their own groundwater.
Yeah.  Zeitgheist too.
I was with you up to bildingsroman
It would be cognitive dissonance to assume that hot days meant the average temperature was rising, and cold days DIDNT mean it was falling IF you ignored every other aspect of climate change

What makes you think I ignore the midterms? I'm not talking about it because it's not a midterm election?
Not necessarily. Lots of products and cosmetics don't list all that information right on the package. Garnier is owned by L'oreal which is in part owned by Nestle. The same goes for The Body Shop products (which ticks me off since they are marketed as being natural, eco-conscious, and ethical, many people wouldn't think twice about buying something like that. I know I was surprised to find out they were intertwined with Nestle) and Maybelline. Some say on the label but for cosmetics you just have to know ahead of time. Also Buitoni products do not list any Nestle affiliation on the package (at least the sauce tub I was able to look up didn't say anything, idk about the pasta packaging). 

Edit: added Buitoni 
Nestle raped my infant son and spit on my grandmother
This is the inevitable result of any large multi national corporation.
Hood River County of Oregon recently passed a referendum banning Nestle bottling plants, people just need to mobilize and decent their natural resources.

A summary of those brands may be summarized as follows:

* sugar
+ artificial flavoring
- bad carbs


It's obscene.  And it's obscene that we as a people let it happen.  Nestle and all the other big food monopolies should be banned from doing business in this country.  Corporations have to get their charters from we the people.
Indeed.  I'm all for the corporate death penalty, esp. corporations that are documented killers.  
What law would cover this, and how much of the economy would be banned?
I heard this story once of a guy who crashed his hang glider behind this line of trees just off a desert interstate and found himself surrounded by Blackwater types aiming a lot of firepower right at his head.

Afterall aren't corporations supposed to be people?
My ideal remedy would be to restore the fairness doctrine to help mitigate the tendency of people to self-balkanize by retreating into echo chambers, establish tougher conflict of interest laws (should be so so SO fucking illegal for politicians to be rewarded for supporting industry written legislation with sinecures and lobbying positions when they leave office - I think tougher term limits for representatives would also make it harder for fabulously wealthy organizations to cultivate pet politicians who'll serve them faithfully for decade after decade), do away with gerrymandering, make voting compulsory, make it illegal to attach riders to any bill and set up publicly funded elections

I kind of like the idea of there being a "house of repeals"... but only if its members are selected demarchically. Like a 2-4 year jury duty
No problem. I encourage anyone to vote for who you think is best regardless of whether or not they're gonna win.

This is aimed solely at Nestle who sucks million gallons of water for a pittance.  Nestle would be looking at 5 cents per gallon, which would be a $55,000 per day hit if they keep the same rate.
Thought that said "Magician lawmaker". I must say, I'm a little disappointed it's not.
I totally agree. I get a water bill every month. How can anybody take water without paying for it? I don't care how much their equipment costs, the water doesn't belong to them. 
Honestly, we need to get on this (as a Michigander).  With the temperatures rising, water is going to be more and more scarce.  We need to shore up our biggest resource (of the next 200 years) now.
Bottled water is an idiot tax anyway. In most of Canada, our tap water goes through more filtration and is cleaner than bottled water. This is also the case in roughly half of the US. 

If the plastic and cooling process didn't have such a big environmental impact, I would be totally opposed to taking away this idiot tax as it pumps a lot of money into our economies by penalizing the idiots. But then we have unrecycled plastic bottles just lying around in landfills, so that kind of sucks too.

Good. Bottled water leaves a massive carbon footprint for something you can get from a tap.
Why not charge everyone?  Do people in Michigan not pay a water bill?  If people are using up water too fast, raise the price, it will impact the people using the most water the most.

Please let this go through. Finally a lawmaker realizing the US people are getting raped by Nestle.
Michigan ought to protect our water. Lord knows when WWIII starts or global warming destroys the climate our Great Lakes will be heavily targeted. Our resources won't last forever if we keep letting evil companies take it from us.
Logic and common sense at work here! Corporations should definitely pay for volume they profit from. Of course this price would just be added to the retail price, but hey, people...plan ahead so you bring enough with you and don't need to buy it.
Isn't Flint, Michigan still using bottled water to compensate for their botched poisoned water supply?


I can't help but think the increase in using bottled water is in relation to that incident and this bottled water fee is a way for the lawmakers to keep fucking them over without actually fixing the underlying problem.
Who the hell chooses to drink nestle water 
Don't worry, most the rest of officials and lawmakers know more than laypeople and realize such a measure would absolutely destroy nearly every manufacturing and ag industry in the state and lead to a mass exodus as companies as they go to places that don't charge above market rate for a key commodity. 
Pfizer pumps 7 billion gallon in Ann Arbor at its factories for a $200 permit. 

It's almost as if groundwater isn't actually a scarce resource in a state surrounded by the largest bodies of freshwater on the planet and unpumped and untreated water truly isnt of any value there.

I couldn't possibly afford to water my grass or my garden if that was the cost. Could barely afford to shower.

Why does it matter what you do with the water?
Sigh.  You know who else sucks millions of gallons of water for a pittance?  Right, ***every single fucking farm in the area***.  Only they suck about 100x as much water.  Yet, I don't hear anyone complaining about them.
It will take a Magician to get this to go through. 
The resources below your ground can belong to you.  People with wells are using the resources below them.  Now here is the trick.  Most people with wells are taking out less water than the ground they own can produce.  Their well is not impacting their neighbors.  I have a well at my new place and I am sure I am using far less water than my land produces.  I am going to totally make up numbers.  Lets say a 0.5 acre lot can make 400 gallons per day on average.  If you take out 150 gallons per day the land can more than keep up so no harm.  These people take issue with a company removing 5000 gallons per day from that lot.  The land can not keep up and they will draw from surrounding areas.  It is not right to cause the underground water to flow away from other people reducing the effectiveness of their well.  
Your water bill is to pay for the pumping and treatment of the water and all the electricity, hardware, chemicals and engineers and technicians that requires. Nestle isn't using any of those resources.

Do you know how much my parents pay for their well water? $0. Their costs associated with the water are the well and pumps they installed and maintain and the electricity to run the pump.
I thought you paid for the installation and the maintenace rather than the water itself.
> This is also the case in roughly half of the US.

Not for long 
It has electrolytes.
Total Recall isn't where they sell air. You're thinking of Spaceballs.
Water is essentially free in these areas. There is no scarcity. The entirety of the cost of water out of your tap is the cost of transporting and treating it. Nestle does all of that themselves.
Check this out:

Corporations like Nestle champion removal of regulations.  Soon we won't be able to drink tap water if they are successful.  Then: we'll have to buy their water.

Charging them for bottling is step 1, getting their money out of politics is step 2.
>Do people in Michigan not pay a water bill?

If you have your own well? Nope, not a dime.
[deleted]
In Michigan if you pump your own water you don't owe anyone anything, it's your water.
This has nothing to do with flint. The pipes that transport water to the people are poisoning the water. There's not a pool of clean water and a pool of poisoned water with nestle hogging all of the former. Nestle cleans and transports the water themselves. If nestle stopped existing these people's water would still be poisoned, they just wouldn't have access to as much bottled water.
The latter, charge them for bottling since some have refused to pay water bills because the water is literally poison, it's legalized extortion.
Do you think water just stops existing when you drink it?
This fee would be a little more than half a cent per bottle.  Are the people of flint using a disproportionate amount of bottled water? Yes. Does it make a dent in the total volume of bottled water sold? No. This is just about using resources responsibly
Most water thats bottled here gets sent out of state. 

Source: Truck driver from Michigan. And hauling bottled water sucks.
Because chances are you're drinking is without knowing it. Most of Nestl√©'s water brands are called "Nestl√©", only: Nestl√© Pure Life. There's also: Perrier, San Pellegrino, Poland Spring, Ice Mountain (the one pumped in MI), Arrowhead, Deere Park, Ozarka, Zephyrhills, Acqua Panna, Vittel, and Buxton to name a few.

Nestle owns a ton of brands that most of us don't know/realize is really Nestle. Some simple Google searching will give you a decent list. 
To add on to what some of the other people have said, Nestle was ranked as the largest food company in the world in 2014-2016 - nestle is absolutely fucking enormous, which is why they seem to have so much sway. 
I'd love to not buy Poland Springs but that's what Walmart sells and the local store buys from Walmart.

My water is alright for showering but even cooking I have to use bottled water or it tastes really off.
Because their water just tastes better.
Who would prefer to drink ass city water? That shit is nasty and if I were to move back to a big city -- I'd buy it again.
It's a cost-benefit thing. Fresh water isn't everywhere, then you have to set up a new facility, train and hire or relocate water quality testers, etc. This would only affect bottled water, so not agriculture. People know Nestle does this bs, where can they move where this won't be an issue.
Most people have no idea how much water factories use. Without getting too specific so I can maintain some anonymity, the company I work for installed a waste water treatment facility in Missouri for $5 million to lower their costs for putting water back into the sewage system. The cleaner water from that facility would pay for itself in less than 2 years. 

Edit: that is due to costs being tied to how hard sewage treatment had to work to get the water back to safe levels of pollution. 
Thats not entirely true, we had a really nice cabin on a privately owned spring fed lake near nestles ground water drawing site, the lake is almost empty at this point now, fishing has been a lot worse, the lake is much shallower and therefore a lot weedier and over has ruined my favorite place of my childhood. Nestle plans to draw even more water next year, meaning it could mean the end of our lake all together, just have swamp-front property 
The difference is the water is used for a reason, other than sale. I can't sell power to my neighbor from my hookup.
The argument often made is that water used on golf courses, farms, etc return to the local ecosystem. However the water used by Nestle is a direct loss to the system. Now, payment wise farmers and such get a much better deal, but charging more to remove water from the system is not unreasonable.
> First, Nestle pays the municipal rate for water which is what everyone who extracts groundwater pays.

And Nestle is doing it for a huge profit.  Cities are doing it to provide their residents with water with no profit.  False equivalency.  

> Second, Nestle ‚Äúsucking up‚Äù water amounts to a single digit % of the water removed from aquifers in the state. Golf courses, farming and other large scale watering projects remove 90%+ of it.

Then a per gallon fee should not be too expensive for them if they use so little.  
Bottled water is actually used for drinking, if anything it should be cheaper than using it to water a lawn.
Because bottled water is a massive environmental disaster, that's why.  By upping the cost of the water, consumers will have to pay more and hopefully realize that they could just as easily buy *reusable* glass, stainless or plastic bottles and just fill-up at home.  
Perhaps because that water puts food on our table.
Well, cause we eat the food they produce. 

People need food too. 
TBH farmers aren't charging $1 per fruit or vegetable harvested and sold due to the water they used for free.  The cost is actually reduced compared to farmers who don't draw water and are at mercy of badly timed dry weather.
They pump a ton of water out of the ground, and dump it right back onto the ground again.  A good portion would not go into the actual plants and be absorbed into the ground.  
Are you slow?
You didn't really think that one through, did you?
They are not reselling water. Dumbass. Fall in some fire. 
I've seen some stupid shit on this website. Congrats, this is top 10.
Right but there are regulations by the DNR in most states that if you pump too much there are fees so that you don't deplete aquifers. Pump size is taken into account when you get a well drilled. 
You pay for the cost of treatment and the infrastructure. Nestle does all that themselves. Water is essentially free. There's no shortage of water in Michigan.
It's got what plants crave!
'Dwade give them the air!' Massive alien machine generates air saving Arnold from eye pop out
And it is wonderful not having a water bill, only downside is the iron in the water.
Is that what Nestle is doing, are the drilling Wells and doing it that way instead of a public water plant?
They do that with electricity many places. 
That is done for the water where I work.  As the usage goes up the price will more than double.  We are the city's largest water customer and this facility has paid for most of the infrastructure upgrades.  During the initial construction the city was given around $18 million for water system upgrades.  
Government taxes bottlers.  The bottlers raise prices to compensate.  Government profits off of massive amount of bottled water sold to citizens of Flint.


Michigan having more expensive bottled water has nothing at all to do with Flint?  Sure...   The same as someone dumping poison in an oasis has nothing to do with the trade caravans that use it.   
It does when I drink it.

I've been very happy with my city's tap water for the last decade, especially after running it through a filter (currently using Soma). No need to waste all that money and plastic.
Protip: Half of all bottled water is tap water
Yeah, that can be true, but each city water is different.  Mine is fine.

Problem with chlorine?  First appreciate that chlorine is better than waterborne disease.  That's why it's there, and it is legally required.  But put some on a pitcher in the fridge.  In a day, the chlorine will be gone.  
NYC tap water is some of the best water you can drink.

In a blind taste test, 75% of people prefered it over bottled water.

> This would only affect bottled water, so not agriculture. 

Why do you think this?
 
>where can they move where this won't be an issue. 

Most the rest of the country. The US isn't a desert nation, aside from a few areas in the southwest water is plentiful for use all over the country. In many cases it routinely floods even because there's too much water. That's why the market rate of untreated and unpumped water is effectively zero in this country. 

I mean a golf course is just using water to sell golf games..
Why couldn't you? You could charge batteries and sell those. Should Energizer or Duracell being paying higher energy rates than any other company that uses energy?
Do you think that water is annihilated into nothingness when it's consumed by a person? 

It's exhaled as water vapor and excreted through sweat and urine and makes its way right back into the water table through the water cycle you should have learned about in elementary school. Nestle sells Michigan bottled water in the Great Lakes basin region, it's all going right back in...

Well, you have to consider the costs of making it safe, mass producing, and then the logistics involved in dispersing it. If you think it's an untapped market or ripe for making money in you're always welcome to start your own business to take advantage of it. 

You are trying to apply emotion to business / economics. It doesn't work. There is nothing that says drinking water should be cheaper than lawn water. Although I would guess whatever coming through your tap is the same coming out the garden hose.
Why? It is a massive waste in both plastic and energy. Except for a few cities in the U.S., tap will be safer than bottled. Especially the plastic which has trouble being recycled more than a few times. Now if you packed it in aluminium then maybe you've got a better argument since aluminium can be recycled countless times without down-cycling.
I think at this point people see the word "corporation" and immediately go into "let's fuck their shit up".  I actually work for a corporation and I don't think we should fuck their shit up.
Wouldn't it be way easier to just tax bottled beverages?
Do people not need water?
As someone who grew up on a ranch where we dug our own irrigation off of a river, just because we aren't weren't paying a water bill doesn't mean we got it for free. There was a lot of time and labor to get the water onto our property. 
They do not dump the water in a sufficient quantity that it would be real resort back down into the ground water the majority of it will be evaporated
The farmers I know just use the Plant Avalible Water formula to know how much to actually put down to avoid water waste from gravity.
No, you and the other down-voters are slow!  Really, really slow.  You apparently think that the industry that uses roughly 1/100,000th of our water is MORE responsible for the water-shortage than the industry that uses roughly 50% of our water.  Like everyone else, your ideology is immune to facts and reality and you have to resort to personal-attacks when someone shows you facts you don't like so much.
Sure, in areas prone to droughts with actual groundwater issues, not in a state that's surrounded on three sides by literal sea sized bodies of fresh water. 
Thanks for the info.
For some reason I brain-farted and was thinking of the remake. It must be 15 years since I've seen the original.
Then Arnold sneaks back into the base and kills the villain who was controlling the oxygen and puts him in a headlock, ironically killing him by strangulation. He walks away into the arms of his chick before looking back, winks to the camera, and says "what an airhead" before credits roll.
Depends where you live.  Had a well where I was living 15 years ago or so, but couldn't drink the water even after it was filtered because it tasted horrible.
That is the entire complaint the representative is making here, yeah. They drilled their own wells, just like anybody else in Michigan is allowed to do, and are taking out as much water as they want, just like everybody else is allowed to.
You have no evidence of that.
Do you support punishing companies that sell compressed air?
Well, ice mountain water made in the small town of Evert, is sold at Wal-Mart and Sam's club across the united states. 

Its safe to say that of the 48 states available to travel to, people from Michigan arent driving to California for water bottled here.

So.... Educated reasoning?

Edit: In 2017 Nestle applied to increase water usage to 400 gallons per minute. From 240 per minute 

I can't use 400 a month.
Yea you gotta stop buying all of these. Not just because the plastic (only a small portion you recycle is ACTUALLY recycled).. but because Nestle is one of the most evil corporations out there. 
welcome to the club.
Its also loaded-up with tons of sugar.  
My small town has AMAZING water. Spring, Texas? Fuck all that bullshit. I'll buy water buy the bottle and gallon.
Protip: Bottled water isn't always bottled from your local city.
I always thought that was so bizarre how anyone could drink straight tap water, because the unfiltered tap water in Arizona is absolute shit. Then I moved to the pacific northwest, and the difference is night and day. While he is wrong about city water vs small town water, there is no denying that some locations just have better tap water than others.
However, even if a city has delicious tap water, if you have old, shitty pipes in your building, it can still taste bad.
Literally in post title "charge water *bottlers* per gallon"
As is a restaurant.  
That's not how batteries work.
It is my understanding they ship it across the country so yes, it goes back into the *general* ecosystem, but it is not being returned to the local ecosystem.
I am stating that it is not unreasonable to expect someone to pay to remove a resource that is normally locally recycled.

How much and how important it might be are different issues and topics to be considered, but it is not unreasonable or irrational. Also, there are bigger problems is not a good reason to not address the issue in front of you. There are always bigger problems, that can be used as a good justification to always do nothing.
> What false equivalency? You think golf courses and farms is providing residents with water? What?

I was talking municipalities.  Golf courses see most of that water go right back in the groundwater table.  Not shipped off to stores to make a profit.  

> Nestle plays by the same rules as everyone else. So good luck getting residents to sign off on paying for the water that they own.

Residents have access to much cheaper water elsewhere.  

It's not that big a deal.  Aquafina and Dasani ALREADY pay RETAIL MUNICIPAL rates and their water costs the same as "spring" water.  $0.05 is less than a penny per bottle.    
So you think they should just get to exhaust our natural resources for their profit without having to pay for it? I'm glad to know you work for a "corporation" otherwise how could you be trusted? Lol
That only shifts the issue from the company to the govt.  The idea should be to put companies like this out-of-business.  
They don't need _bottled_ water.
That's what the bank robber said after having to crack the safe!!! 
Evaporates out into space? That's not what I learned.

No worries. Lot of remakes blend.
How it should've ended. 
Sure.  Nestle ‚Äúmight‚Äù not raise their prices with the tax.
Do you think a company like Nestle should be able to take as much water as they want, no regulations? It's a little shady, what they've been doing. I don't trust them. I think selling our water at a higher price deters their abuse of a natural resource. Yes, that resource is renewable, but it can be displaced. It doesn't just come back to where it was originally. On the flip side though, you don't want the people in Flint paying a lot for bottled water and Nestle would probably increase the price. It is a major issue that I admit, I don't know the ins and outs of, but I do know that companies like Nestle are super shady. They shouldn't be able to do whatever they want.
There are at least 17 different kinds of plastics but only a couple can be recycled and the kind they use for water bottles isnt one of them.

Fun fact: Michigan takes garbage from 7 different states and Canada because dumping fees are so low here it costs less to actually ship the trash here and dump it
I'm probably gonna keep buying it so long as it's convenient and cheaper then Aquafina
Is nestle worse than the other water suppliers? I'm pretty sure all water companies (drinks in general, I think) get subsidies on water. Are they up to stuff that coke and Pepsi would find reprehensible? 
Which is what would make it tasty, because our brains are programmed to react to sugar positively.
Small town water can be the worst, because some of them let factories dump all kinds of crazy shit in their back hard.
Oh, I ignored that part knowing it would be readily struck down in court. The state can't charge one corporation for something and not charge another for the exact same thing. 

In any case it's just a pointless hypothetical, there's no legislative support for such a measure, just a singular uniformed politician pointlessly making noise with no chance of doing anything.
And restaurants on golf courses are practically evil incarnation! 
Sorry, I got a little ahead of myself. Point still stands that you could store and sell electricity in batteries. Although, you are correct in that primary batteries only go from chemical to electrical and not both ways as rechargeable batteries do. 
Water is wildly expensive to ship, Nestle uses regionalized bottling sources for this reason. Most of the Michigan water is bottled under the Ice Mountain label and sold to the Upper Midwest

Many small rivers singularly carry more water south out of the state daily than Nestle pumps in an entire year. I don't think you appreciate just how inconsequential this amount of water is.

Isn't that what everyone does?  Farmers are exhausting the soil, the water.  Lumber companies are exhausting the forest. Trucking companies are breaking the roads.  Every grocery store and restaurant is exhausting everything, because it's all grown in a field and shipped by truck.  And even worse, they are doing it for profit!

You are exhausting the coal by running your computer and you are exhausting the natural gas by heating your house.  You might even be doing this at work, which means you're profiting too!  You dastardly SOB!
You want to make it illegal to sell bottled water?
Then wouldn't it be much easier to just pass a law saying it's illegal to sell bottled water?
I just realized I'm debating environmental issues with a jackass who owns five bwms, including a fucking v10 m5 that gets about 2 mpg.

Hypocrisy much pal?  

Your whole life is an environmental disaster.  Just changing the oil in your $100k race car uses more resources than a semi full of Dasani. 
They don't, but *from a water usage point of view* (not a wasteful packaging point of view), why does it matter which way they get the water that they need?
So do you want to answer the question I actually asked?
[deleted]
Groundwater doesn't work the way you think it does.
No, just a lot better-informed than you.
Regulates is different than denies. Nestle is permitted per their rules, their allowances aren't restrictive though because it's Michigan, not Arizona   

Nestle is not negatively impact Michigan water supplies. Full stop.
What evidence do you have that they are taking too much? Their use is dwarfed by essentially every other user.  There is no shortage of water.
My sister and her two kids only drink bottled water, because they don't like the taste out of the tap. Sigh. Her excuse is always, "..but we recylce the bottles.." Double sigh. 
You know what's even cheaper? A couple glass water bottles and household water filters

One of Pepsi's water brands...
Oh, well that's good to hear.  I hate seeing people turned off on terrible companies bottling tap water then selling it at exorbitant prices after they ruin local aquifers.  
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-21/nestl-makes-billions-bottling-water-it-pays-nearly-nothing-for

So glad you asked! Yes, WAY worse. I just learned a bunch of new things too. Ugh. This boycot started in 1977 and is still happening. We can and are hurting Nestle with these boycots. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott)
Which is basic physiological understanding.  If people choose to ingest tons of sugar, salt, etc, its still their choice.  Even if it's a poor choice.
Loophole is that it's anyone who bottles water, while this is meant to target Nestle it would also target coke, or pepsi if they have production facilities there. You're right this is unlikely to go anywhere but it makes the public aware, if the public is aware and moved enough politicians have no choice if they want to stay in office.
See that is interesting because the Deer Park water sold here in Atlanta (just looked at a bottle) is not bottled in the south. The pack I have is bottled in PA.

Also, while it may be an inconsequential amount it is about paying to extract a resource. We charge others to do it and if you don't you set a precedent. We already did that with farmers and now turning that problem around is a nightmare of politics.

Do we really want to set the precedent again so we have a huge fight on our hands years down the line?

Are you retarded?  Coming on here defending terrible corporations and thinking that someone owning a car is somehow worse than the billions of plastic bottles that Nestle churns out.  Stop being jealous and get fucked.

And if you're going to criticize someone, at least get the MPG figure correct - pleb. 
So have reusable water bottles/containers. Takes 4 seconds to fill a bottle.
Michigan State showed that water actually flows out from the aquifers into The Great Lakes, and pumping can cause issues with groundwater depletion in MI. The attached presentation also contains real life examples in MI. So yea they likely are causing issues. Nestles case is on pg 31/37 from 2003 and they were found to be causing issues!

In the article it says out of state companies are basically coming in and taking as much as they want. i support charging them more for taking OUR resources. Nestle is just the company I think of, I'm sure there are many others taking more than they do.
I don't ever buy bottled water, but I wonder if Dasani and Aquafina are bottled at the local Coke/Pepsi distributor. If they are that would represent a small ecological savings through a reduction in transport costs. 
Edit: Also I bet Aquifina/Dasani are safer since they are basically treating bottling tap water which has shown to be tested more often for bacteria and contaminants than normal "spring" water.

http://www.bcmj.org/council-health-promotion/bottled-vs-tap-water
Very true.
I'm not really sure this is an "issue" the public needs to be aware of. Bottling companies are not negatively impacting the availability of water in the state.
> We charge others to do it and if you don't you set a precedent. 

We literally don't. No company or home in Michigan pays a rate for non-municipal water...

 The cost of water in a place like Michigan is the equipment, electricity, and technicians to treat and pump it. If a person isn't using those things and is doing the work themselves then there's nothing to charge for. The state is not lacking for groundwater to pump. 
Right, and nestle pays for their water, just like any other municipal customers.  Seems like either you don't have a point, or your point is "let's fuck their shit up because corporation".
Someone owning five outlandish cars that require huge amounts of resources to build has no standing to comment.  You're supporting terrible corporations by doing what you do.

And I'm not the least bit jealous of your shitty bmws, with their oil pumps held on by plastic screws that fail after seven years and grenade the engine.  Or when the turbos crack at 70k miles and need to be replaced.  How much oil does it take to produce one of those?

I drive a supercharged wrangler jk with 37 inch tires, to my office in the suburbs.  But at least I'm not a hypocrite.
Can you be specific about a problem Nestle caused? Are cities now unable to draw enough water in Michigan because there isn't water?  
And as much as they want is a tiny drop in the bucket. Water is a renewable resource. Regulation for regulations sake is dumb. Unless you have some evidence that they are harming the environment you're just being vindictive.
It's a negative impact to the state budget and an unfair practice that a company can pay little to nothing while a resident still has to pay a utility bill.
Sorry, should have been more clear. We charge other companies to extract resources.
How much are they paying?
Yes, but we replant trees, we fertilize the soils, truckers pay big tolls and fees yearly.

I don't see nestle putting watet back into the earth.
I'm not being a hypocrite, you're only throwing the accusation out there as a means to justify your weak comments coming out in support of Nestle.  I can own as many cars as I like.  Motor oil gets recycled far more often than plastic water bottles, which mostly end up in the landfills or the ocean.  

You clearly have no grasp on what the meaning of the bigger picture is or the lesser evil.  In America we pretty much need cars, some of us have the means to buy and afford more than others.  I don't even drive my cars everyday.  But at least I'm not wasting my time and energy with plastic water bottles or Styrofoam cups - I'll use mugs and glass water bottles.  What are you doing to offset your impact to the planet??
Yea this is about the increase they've requested. Which would cause issues with wetland water levels in the area around the plant and nearby shallow wells of residents. The increase they are requesting isn't small its a request to go from 150gpm to 400gpm. Sorry, I meant to add that the issues that were seen happened during their own testing in 2000 when they were exploring the site and were testing different extraction rates.

Edit:I forgot words

I doubt those companies care about the environment. I bet they cut corners left and right to make money. It takes a lot of time in some places for groundwater to replenish. I think it's foolish and naive to assume those guys aren't harming the environment. I really don't think I'm being vindictive. I've heard plenty of bad things about Nestle and I'm sure other companies are similar.
Residents that use well water don't pay anything.

Utility bills are to pay for pumping and treatment equipment supplying the water, not for the water itself. If someone is pumping and treating their own water they shouldn't and currently don't owe anything.  

My parents have had their own well system supplying their house for over 30 years. Do you know how much they've paid the government for 30 years of water? $0
Who in Michigan is being charged to extract water?  And comparing a readily renewable resource that doesn't get destroyed in use with other resources without those features isn't rational.
Same price as a homeowner who turns on the tap. 
Well, they're putting it back.  Unless they're shipping it to orbit, or they are fusing the hydrogen atoms to make helium, it's still water and it ends up in the hydrological cycle.
I'm not supporting nestle.  I'm supporting people having the freedom to buy a goddamn bottle of water when I am at a  game 40 miles from my house and I cannot bring a Nalgene bottle into the stadium.  It's a modest convenience.

Which is very different than buying a fleet of stupid cars that waste 100x more energy than a village in Africa.

You don't like bottled water but you like v10 cars.  This whole thing is you basically saying stop liking things that you don't like.  Which makes you a hypocrite and petty.
That's why environmental regulations are for. You have no evidence that the existing ones aren't working. You're just assuming they aren't.
The title is misleading bullshit. You absolutely can own a shape as it relates to a certain application. But you have to do some work in order to demonstrate an Innovative concept. Kit kat just has a slightly different shape to it's sectioned chocolate pieces, which is not nearly enough Innovation to claim that it is different from any other sectioned chocolate.
> which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat. 

I guess I have been eating them all wrong.

Wouldn't the idea of the KitKat shape be the same as the Toblerone? 
Well, you can own a shape. Mcdonald's owns the double arch.
A shape is a 2-dimensional thing. They mean form.
Didn't Apple patent a rectangle, why is this different?
And the lawyers get richer.
Apple apparently owned the rounded corner
Can't wait for Aldi to do it better at half the price
These guys ownin it now. https://imgur.com/a/3kQmGFy
Screw Nestle. They don‚Äôt own everything 
Good, hope they keep losing fights and go out of business. Shitty company that makes Comcast customer support look good
Doesn't Apple own the rounded rectangle?
Round - all our candies are round therefore we own patent to round candies - crazy idea no??
innovate concept? This is a trademark dispute, not a patent application. 
That's how you know it's a BBC article
I think that's why kitkat tried to copyright their own version of the bar.    Mondelez  actually own the shape for the toblerones. the case was moved against nestle because they couldn't prove the kitkat shape was iconic across all states of europe and not because it was a shape.  
Except the Nestle did not apply for a patent 70 years ago, they applied for a patent on the shape about 16 years ago. That is the real problem, others were all ready using that shape and it is not iconic or exclusive to KitKat, unlike say Toblerone.
Yeah, but Kit Kat's shape isn't specific enough for that
Do you want to offer a suggestion of a better way to resolve trade disputes?
[deleted]
Kit Kat's customer support is bad? Just out of curiosity, what was wrong with your chocolate bar for you to find that out?
You should try Japanese Kit Kats - green tea Kit Kats are pretty darned yummy.

300! Varieties.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit\_Kats\_in\_Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Kats_in_Japan)
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was reasonably certain Mondelez had developed and patented the idea of their bar concept (the shape and therefore its breakability) before KitKat did, though I should've worded it less ambiguously. The utility of patent laws aside, Nestle's greed, though, is nowhere near as ambiguous. 
I should've rephrased it better. I meant to say that Toblerone likely had the idea and patented it first.
What else uses the kit kat shape?
Yes, I understand that. I'm just saying that you *CAN* own a shape if it's distinct enough. But that's up to the courts.

Well drug dealers use guns, because they don't have access to contract law.
Send in the Jedi. 
fixed it!
Found a razor in it but customer support told me to restart my kit Kat.
First of all there was chocolate all over my wafers and to top it off the engineering of this candy is shit! You barely step on the KK and it breaks into 4 pieces, what shit!
I'm sure u/XeroMCMXC implied nestle. It's an evil company for all we know
300!? I'm surprised there's enough room in Japan for that many flavors.
You literally did not read the article or did not comprehend the article.
It's not the shape that you copyright it's the innovation and sectioned chocolate is pretty common.
This is where the fun begins!
Razor in a Kit Kat? Give me a break.
Considering that the chairman of Nestl√© thinks that the idea of access to water as a basic human right is an extreme idea, I'd say it's fair to call them evil:

>The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.

-[Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Nestl√© CEO 1997-2008](http://snopes.com/fact-check/nestle-ceo-water-not-human-right/)
If Nestle went out of business would we lose Kit Kats in America since they're made by Hershey here?
I didn't read the article. Went straight to the comments.
In short, Nestle was suing JK Rowling on the grounds that the triangular Deathly Hallows symbol infringed on the shape of Kit Kat chocolate bars.   Nestle won, and now future editions of the last book in the series must be renamed to "Harry Potter and the Scrumptious KitKat".  

Thats the first time I have ever read "jack" in place of "steal" in the title or text of a news article.
Yet another example of a corrupt government favoring rich corporations and turning a blind eye to their criminal behavior at the expense of everybody else.  Not like we aren't used to it.

Why don't we just drop all pretenses of being a representative democracy and admit that our government is there to serve and protect the interests of the rich.  Cause that's the truth of the matter.
Just to throw some numbers on the fire..

From another article earlier this year
>Statewide, Nestle Waters used a total of 2,164 acre-feet of water from all sources in 2014, said Larry Lawrence, Nestle's natural resource manager. That's about 705 million gallons ‚Äì enough to irrigate roughly 700 acres of farmland, or keep two golf courses green


Yup.. they used the same amount used to keep 2 whole golf courses green.

[California has 1,140 golf courses.](http://www.golflink.com/golf-courses/state.aspx?state=CA) and [7.9 Million acres of irrigated farm land..](http://www.almonds.com/blog/water/almonds-use-13-california%E2%80%99s-irrigated-farmland-just-9-california%E2%80%99s-agricultural-water)

So their total water use from all sources is 0.01% of what the farms use. How much are those farmers paying?

FWIW Arrowhead springs flows about 2.6 billion gallons a year.. Nestlee took 25 million from Arrowhead Springs.. Just about 1%
http://marketing.joneslanglasalle.com/SouthWest/Listings/inlandempire/arrowheadsprings/plan.html

It's just a distraction from the real issues.
I don't disagree with the lawsuit, but it would be nice if people gave the pistachio and alfalfa farmers more crap. In the scheme of things, despite my dislike of it bottled water is small potatoes.
Who is Jack Water and why has no one caught him yet
[deleted]
Nestle water consumption is negligible compared to Golf Courses, attacking Nestle is a farce. Meanwhile we over-farm to produce Ethanol, which is bad for cars, reduces fuel efficiency, and wastes more gas to produces than the ethanol it creates.

Yea, this is a story, but how about we fix physical problems with worse consequences.
The capital 'J' in jack totally threw me out there. I was like Who the fuck is Jack Water, and why does it mean to "Jack Water"
[deleted]
This is terrible "journalism".  "Jack"?  Fucking really?  Anyway, it's completely misleading too.  Nestle's permit expired for their pipeline.  It's not like they "jacked" a convenience store with a 9mm.  They were even still paying for the water on the original contract.  If anything I'd be more upset that the price was so low.  
May I ask how you came to the final decision on which words in the title you were going to capitalize? 
I've read on reddit, every single time this has come up, that Nestle makes efforts to renew their contract every year, but since nobody really cares they don't really care. I mean honestly, if you show up to a restaurant, ate the food, tried to pay, and nobody cares... wouldn't you be like ok and just leave?

If someone could link me a source for this I'd be appreciative, but it makes sense to me regardless. Combined with how little water they use in the grand scheme of things, this is nothing more than a scapegoat. Nestle is an evil company, but this isn't one of those times.
And they are still doing it, they haven't stopped for a minute.
Nestle can't complain, the forest service has been cracking down on all the cabins owners using the same water source with a valid permit.  How some small time users of maybe 100 gallons a years over a sparse population are a threat to ecology and not someone yanking 28 million gallons is not is a leap of logic that requires a small bag of silver pieces to understand.
But they make chocolate, they can't be that bad.

Jack? You still stuck in 2001? 
"Nestle pays only $524.00 a year to pull millions of gallons of water a year out of a southern California forest during the midst of a historic drought. Is it just a coincidence that Nestle, one of the world's biggest multinational corporations, is allowed to engage in this type of outrageous activity? If a small group of private individuals tried to do what Nestle has been doing for years, they would be quickly charged, prosecuted, and imprisoned. 
Why is California giving away it's water to billion-dollar for-profit companies basically for free? That's irresponsible, corrupt and sick.
If they ever figure out how to harness the air we breath, we are all FUKT.
[deleted]
Legal question: what gives these groups standing to sue?
What the hell?  So our water is jacked and now a group of lawyers and some well-to-do smartasses are going to charge us for it by taking our tax money in a law suit? Adding in what you've already paid Nestle, you can pay for this a third time now and be taxed thrice as well.
Fuckin good. There is no reason why a company should be able to use a scarce public resource to sell and make profit should be allowed.

Ya know, unless all profits went to the state. [But we all know that Nestle isn't fucking doing that.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pzTg8Kclz6M/U1SXdKJ_Z5I/AAAAAAAADh4/HCUV24hYO8Y/s1600/Tank+Girl_1a.JPG)
where are all those shitstain redditors that were defending Nestle when this news first broke?

edit: ayyy, look at all these redditors who have Nestle's $300 billion dick rubbing furiously against their collective prostate.  Nestle regulates our government, not the other way around, leading to double standards.
Jack Water sounds like a superhero secret identity.
I'm very confused... how is the pipeline between a forest in California and a bottling plant in Ontario only 4 miles?
So we're suing ourselves? Good idea. 
Wait... WE'RE IN A DROUGHT?!
Ah yes. The ol "Jack Water" maneuver. Of course named after Jack Water of the Michigan Waters who was arrested in 1907 for arson. 
mixed feelings, arrowhead is best water
hurr durr corperashunz r bad
Jack Water sounds like a superhero secret identity.
Stop Capitalizing EverytHing
> Nestl√© pays only $524 a year to pull as many as 28 million gallons of water a year out of the forest

Drought aside, this is just horrendous.
What I want to know is how those 28 bazillion gallons they take actually effects the water supply people use. I don't know jack about water tables or mountain springs and I have to wonder about the implied connection between water that we use and water that the local wildflowers use. Yes, I'd prefer that the water didn't go to line Nestle's pockets and I prefer my national parks to be as nature made them. But I'm unclear if Nestle was stopped that anyone here could water their lawns again. Or take longer showers. 
THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT! I live in California and have to deal with this shit and they're taking 28 million gallons a year and paying $524 for it? What the actual fuck California. Get your shit together! 
So we took something from them that they don't need and will get more of for allowing a company to take something from us that we need and are limited to so they can charge us in currency we don't need and can get more of?
so no ones taken a hammer to said pipe line yet??
Yet people think less regulation would benefit us? 
Man, you got the wrong party to sue. You're suing America; the American people? WTF? How about Nestle? We already got ripped off. Don't take our money too!
Then they poison said water to increase the turnover of their wealth-generating cells so there's room for more new cells.
Capitalize The Start Of Each Word!
We gotta stop buying bottled water.  These assholes won't stop as long as there is still demand for their product.

Tap water is just as good to drink.  It's actually regulated by the EPA as opposed to the FDA for bottled water.  The regulations are more stringent for tap water to be clean of contaminants. 
Why can't we sue Nestle? Or better yet, prosecute them?
what about the rest of the water they are 'jacking' from aquifers in a state in the midst of its worst national drought in history and paying pennies on the dollar for the water itself?
Our government is REACTIVE not PROACTIVE.... its easier to apologize than to get permission!!! We will wait until NYC is underwater before we do anything to regulate pollution. 
That Jack Water guy can never be trusted.
Sadly i expect that this is all going to blowover and nestle will keeping taking and reselling water at next to no cost for millions in profit because some Fuck will renew their license and give some Bullshit excuse why they shouldn't be penalised for more than a Decade of taking water with an expired permit.

Ofcourse that Bullshit excuse will come in the form of some fucked up surreal liability loophole spoken in leagalease that will make it an offical accepted piece of Bullshit like "nestle wasn't at fault because they didn't know their subcontracters permit was expired, blame is on subcontracted company who is undergoing major reform" (rename the siphoning plant and change one employee)

Voila, under the magic of legal loophole Bullshit i can see nestle getting away with proportionally no penality compared to the damage they are doing and profits they rake in from improper siphoning of the neccessary water source in a drought stricken area.

Nestle "drinking water isn't a right, it's a privalledge" so we'll just take all of the water from you that you have the right to use, taking your rights away from it, and then sell it back to you at 1,000x the price
[deleted]
Can we focus on the issue?? Not what fuckin word they used in the title.   
Great, another bullshit article where absolutely no one on Reddit understands that agriculture and farming uses all our water, not bottled-water factories...
[deleted]
NEWSFLASH:  We need to sue Coke and Pepsi because it has been found that they are using WATER in their products!

Nestle is purchasing water from an Indian nation.  No harm no foul.  
The fact that *it's legal* for individuals to pay out the wazoo for water at a time of drought, and Nestle can just bottle as much as they like to sell for profit for only 500 bux is fucking disgusting. Direct your anger at your government, where it belongs.
Government being used to empower the rich? That's nothing new and exists in all forms of government. So what do we do?

The socialist solution: Give government more power.

The libertarian solution: Take governments power away.

Which one makes more sense to you?
Nestle makes me sick.  Boycott them, and everything they make.  
This thread is inundated with Nestle's lackies.  How can anyone want to defend a corporation that wants to take away our water so that it might profit from it?  And don't give me I'm some conspiracy nut because I'm certainly not.  There is something very sketchy going on here.
This is the first time I've heard anyone use that word in like 6 years.

I thought "Jack Water" was a thing because it's capitalized 
[deleted]
The first instant my mind processed this title I thought it was some dude named 'Jack Water'. Title didn't really make sense.
Really speaks to the quality of the source, doesn't it?
'Idiocracy' is coming true. 
'Jack' is a shortened version of 'hijack', describing heist-style hijinx by which things are stolen.  

'Hijack' has a less obvious origin, but is thought to refer to a practice by which zinc miners in Missouri used to pilfer high quality zinc to sell on their own.  Zinc ore was, supposedly known as 'Jack', and the most pure concentrations were known as "High Jack".  So, miners would, so the story goes, drop nugs of high jack in their boots and smuggle them out of the mine, to make a little money on the side.
[deleted]
Must be a Midwest thing. 
It's how you know this person is a serious journalist and not the kid who crashed his moms SUV
Well they're not really stealing it if they're allowed to do it.  
Was thinking the same thing
It's the LA Weekly. I think they want to be America's Daily News.
Yeah some guy named jack one time must've stolen a bunch of shit
Your complaint is properly with the Federal government then.  Nestle asked for and got permission.  It is not stealing at that point.  The lawful owner allowed them to take it.

If you disagree with the decision to allow Nestle to take water, that disagreement would be with the government.
He just got done watching "Straight Outta Compton", let the guy live a little!
And capitalized. I was like... who the fuck is this Jack Water son of a bitch.

From war is a racket:

"I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil intersts in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested."[p. 10]
"War is a racket. ...It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives." [p. 23]

"The general public shoulders the bill [for war]. This bill renders a horrible accounting. Newly placed gravestones. Mangled bodies. Shattered minds. Broken hearts and homes. Economic instability. Depression and all its attendant miseries. Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations." [p. 24]

General Butler is especially trenchant when he looks at post-war casualties. He writes with great emotion about the thousands of tramautized soldiers, many of who lose their minds and are penned like animals until they die, and he notes that in his time, returning veterans are three times more likely to die prematurely than those who stayed home.

Because unfortunately there are all too many people dumb enough to support the government.  You need look no farther then all the Hillary and Bush supporters.  You need look no farther then the people who say they don't like Hillary/Bush, but are going to vote for her anyway because of the evil Republican/Democrat they are running against. You need loon no farther then all the willing plebes who wave their flags when we bomb Iraq, or Libya, or Syria, or wherever we are told the "bad people" are.  You need look no farther then the people who nod their heads with glassed over eyes and say we "needed to bail out the banks in 2008 to save the economy".  

Unfortunately we get the government we deserve.  Unless and until people wake up we won't get anything better.
Did you read the article though? The title is so misleading, basically companies have been taking water from this spring for decades. The company that was there before Nestle simply allowed their license to use the spring and never bothered to re-new it but continued to draw from the spring anyway. When Nestle took over that company they continued to use the spring as it had been for years. 

This article is literally just about how a company let a license expire and didn't do anything about it. This happens all the time in business, although that does not make it right. However the author simply tries to take advantage of the drought in California to drum up a fake story of the government opening the back door for Nestle to steal water that they've literally been using for years. It's bad journalism meant to generate clicks. Nothing more. 
Who is pretending that isnt the case exactly?
The only way to truly do away with this is the removal of the Electoral Voting process, abolishing citizens united, and removing the monetary loopholes lobbyists exploit to legally bribe our congress and senate.

So pretty much, we need another revolution :)

And there will be no end until citizens and a candidate come together. Why would they ever want to stop the money?
Is this the same place that they've had that a permit that expired years ago, but they pay the fee every year?
That's why some people like the notion of smaller or localized government.
> Not like we aren't used to it.

Used to getting plummeted like bitches.
I don't think that's ever been argued, and that's the way it's always been. Today's rich are the nobles of the past, and like
Nobles the rules really don't apply to them and the government is meant to enrich the nobles further and simply pacify the rest of the people so they are content and don't get in the way of the wealthy families running the world. 
Actually, technically, we are literally not a democracy anymore. There was a study done proving that [we are effectively an oligarchy.](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) So you're not wrong.  
We can't do that! The Elections industry is a massive! There's no way their lobbyists would let that happen.

If anything, they'll demand protections to keep out competition, and increase spending limits.
Ah, politics! The art of lying, bribery, corruption, and a sense of order!
Because 99% of operations are standard government-for-the-people operations.  You don't here about that governor from Nebraska who's doing his normal day-to-day tasks.
Well to be fair a government determines who is and isn't a criminal by definition. So its not criminal behavior at all.
Your nation is an Oligarchy on its way to being a Plutocracy. I'm sure that in our lifetime we'll see a tacit revival of slavery in America.
The jig is up when Hillary wins the nomination. Most Americans will realize this is not a democracy and hasn't been for some time.
How dare you disrupt the circlejerk. 
Nobody said that CA isn't fighting this battle on multiple fronts.
the pistachio and alfalfa farmers pay a premium for their water and provide the state with lucrative tax money. Nestle provides 500 dollars. I got 500 in my fucking wallet right now, can I have as much water as I want now? Didn't fucking think so. 
Alfalfa?  That doesn't make sense.  Alfalfa doesn't take that much water compared to any other crop, really.

It's not just food. 
I don't buy a single one of those products and that's without knowing that Nestle owned them.. guess I just hate them all-round. Though I did used to eat a drumstick every now and again which I never do anymore. Fuck Nestle.
Look at Yum! Foods.  Or how much shit Time Warner owns.  I have over 100 TV channels.  They are owned by (iirc) only 6 different companies.
I've been trying to boycott Nestle for the last decade or so based on thier company's dispicable practices.  I learned real fast that they produce an insane amount of products.  Had to switch my cat food, gotta eyeball what bottled water I purchase.  It's been a difficult boycott.  Damn thier coffee creamers!
Yeah I always get a laugh out of that at halloween....damn now I want a Mars bar. Oh forgot to point out also that you should see if any of the chocolate they sell you in the States is even real chocolate, a lot of places use that fake chocolate now because selling the coco butter nets a nice profit. 
Wow I thought you were full of shit so I looked up that golf>nestle in water consumption.   I found a business insider article that said 90M gallons per year per 18hole course and over 860 courses in the state.  Works out to 77.4B gallons of water per year statewide.   We could have had 2700 other companies just like nestle and they still wouldn't have used as much water as golf.   
From another article earlier this year
>Statewide, Nestle Waters used a total of 2,164 acre-feet of water from all sources in 2014, said Larry Lawrence, Nestle's natural resource manager. That's about 705 million gallons ‚Äì enough to irrigate roughly 700 acres of farmland, or keep two golf courses green


Yup.. they used the same amount used to keep 2 whole golf courses green.

[California has 1,140 golf courses.](http://www.golflink.com/golf-courses/state.aspx?state=CA) and [7.9 Million acres of irrigated farm land..](http://www.almonds.com/blog/water/almonds-use-13-california%E2%80%99s-irrigated-farmland-just-9-california%E2%80%99s-agricultural-water)

So their total water use from all sources is 0.01% of what the farms use. How much are those farmers paying?

FWIW Arrowhead springs flows about 2.6 billion gallons a year.. Nestlee took 25 million from Arrowhead Springs.. Just about 1%

Drinking water is also a high value use of a valuable resource. The truth is Nestl√© is getting shit because of hatred of bottled water drinkers. Of course these same people will chug down a 2 liter of Mt Dew or 4 cans of Monster energy drink and not even make the connection that it's bottled water too.
Ethanol is that bad? Shit.
I'm all for some good ol' fashioned corporation hate, but in this case Nestle is small potatoes. There are plenty of things to be unhappy with Nestle over, but there a bigger targets to go after for CA water consumption. 
At the time, Palm Springs counted justnineteen courses, whereas the city now has "One hundred and twenty-five golf courses, 2,250 holes, or rather continually thirsty pits, which soak up 1.2 million gallons of water just to survive." https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs,_California
[deleted]
no one gets a pass, just because they use less than other wasteful places
On the other hand, the case here has a decent chance of actually making a difference. There's also a possibility of this setting a precedent for future court cases (including the golf courses). Also, there is the factor of distribution, is Nestle taking water away from an area that needs that water? Because California is a big state and there are places that will need water more than others. (I'm afraid I'm not an expert on this particular topic, but I do see this as a positive step rather than a waste of time).

Just because it's not the biggest issue doesn't mean it's a bad move. And it might be a bigger issue than you think.
Also the golf courses are negligible compared to the agriculture sector. 
But those golf courses actually paid their fucking bills, and don't try to keep using those resources 30 years later...

They also don't use up that much water. People just think millions of gallons is a lot. It is a lot but it isn't that much.

Go bankrupt? Are you kidding me, you are suing people who can print money to pay you with or just cut off more social programs. That can't happen to the US right now. 
Can we just cut the bullshit please? All this feigned anger is pathetic. Their water use is but a fraction of the water we literally throw away and waste in agriculture and livestock in CA. The amount of water Nestl√© uses is the equivalent of at most raising a couple thousand cows. 

How about we focus on shit that really matters? The biggest use of water in the state is largely ignored by our hippies organization and government agencies.
we have socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor
They have been doing it forever now. You just needed a permit to do so and a lot of these permits are older than dirt at this point and never refiled. I believe the one they are using is from back before people gave a shit about the environment. It's a real kicker at another park people have cabins and live there all nice and happy till the water level got low and now they aren't allowed to pull ground water however the bottleing plant can, so go figure.  
Because this is on federal land and the state doesn't have a say in it.

all that solution does is shift that power into the hands of corporations who are even less accountable and cause even worse damage.


those regulations come in response to something in the first place. take away the regulations and there is no response and we end up with robber barons and flammable rivers, again. 
You really believe the way to stop oligarchy is to give corporations unchecked power? Back in the early 1900s there were very few regulations. We had child labor, women dying in a fire as their factory had locked them in, countless others dying in unsafe labor conditions, unsafe food and products, and the greatest wealth disparity. 

Yes, too many politicians line their pockets with lobbyist money. But the answer isn't to just hand over all power to corporations, it's to separate our government from the corporations and put it in the hands of the people.
A government permit from awhile back. They legally have the okay to pump that water but they never review or update the permits. 
So farming on cheap subsidized water accounts for 85% of the water use and Nestle a fraction of a single percent. 

What do you think the problem is?
It was more that they're less than a tenth of a percent of the problem. It's a smokescreen. They are a drop in the empty bucket that is our drought. 
From another article earlier this year
>Statewide, Nestle Waters used a total of 2,164 acre-feet of water from all sources in 2014, said Larry Lawrence, Nestle's natural resource manager. That's about 705 million gallons ‚Äì enough to irrigate roughly 700 acres of farmland, or keep two golf courses green


Yup.. they used the same amount used to keep 2 whole golf courses green.

[California has 1,140 golf courses.](http://www.golflink.com/golf-courses/state.aspx?state=CA) and [7.9 Million acres of irrigated farm land..](http://www.almonds.com/blog/water/almonds-use-13-california%E2%80%99s-irrigated-farmland-just-9-california%E2%80%99s-agricultural-water)

So their total water use from all sources is 0.01% of what the farms use. How much are those farmers paying?

FWIW Arrowhead springs flows about 2.6 billion gallons a year.. Nestlee took 25 million from Arrowhead Springs.. Just about 1%
http://marketing.joneslanglasalle.com/SouthWest/Listings/inlandempire/arrowheadsprings/plan.html

Tell me again how Nestlee is the big problem here? It's just a distraction to keep you from thinking about the real drain on the state's water.
If you read the article it doesn't appear they still did anything wrong legally. It's just some random groups trying to sue over it. That and all the comments you were talking about for the most part I think were along the lines of they use x% of water vs agriculture.
I can't believe people actually defended nestle

We can't blame Nestle for asking permission. It's the Feds that should have refused to give them permission.
One problem at a time I suppose? You got to remember people outside of Cali generally have no idea this is even going on.
Yes! we should force Nestlee to pay the same rates as farmers.. (BTW that add up to $1,250 a year for the 24 million gallons (73 acre feet) of water they get from Arrowhead springs.  An extra $700 for the state.. woo!


They're being sued bc they're allowing nestle to take the water , even though their permit is expired. 

What is it about that , that you don't understand? IF it wasn't for the forest service allowing this to happen, then it likely wouldn't be an issue.

Understand now?
They have been pulling it from there for longer then most of us have been alive. It's a big deal now because of the lack of water and rainfall so people are getting a lot louder about it. At this point if one of the forests catches fire they are so fucked.
Because they have no morality and only care about profits.
You don't understand how power is applied in either case to make that point.
Whichever one gives me all the power.
I think people are just tired of reddit's hatred of corporation for no reason.  In the scheme of things Nestle is taking a fraction of a percent of water from California, and things like golf courses and agriculture use so much more than Nestle, yet there is nobody complaining about  them.  This whole attack is based on not like corporations and nothing else.

A lot of people don't support the governement; it doesnt need it, it can support itself. All it needs is for people to watch netflix, drink coke, and do nothing. That's the majority of "support" they are getting.

What? Please ELI: 5 me exactly why we should have let our financial institutions and basic fabrics of society completely collapse? We're talking about a global financial meltdown and complete collapse of society. Why do we want that again?

Yes it sucks we ended up in that spot, and we could have handled the bailouts *way* better, but we ended up in a position with no choice.
Well, you also just called everyone dumb but you misused "then" and "farther" which should be "than" and "further".   
"You need look no further than..." is correct.  
I don't like being picky about grammar, but when you insult people's intelligence you should try to not make basic grammatical errors.  
I do agree with you for the most part, though. But seriously, you're not nearly as smart and edgy and ahead of everyone as you think.  
Additionally, it's not that people are dumb as much as it's that they are deliberately mislead, lied to, and used by the ruling elites. When a country deliberately under-funds education and favors theocratic beliefs, military supremacy, and a bitter idea of capitalism you can't quite blame the citizens' intelligence because they don't have very much power in the system they've been brought up in. True, it'd be better if people were better informed, but I wouldn't be so harsh on your fellow citizens- you need them to fight the fuckers fucking all you, so befriend them, don't belittle them
As far as I understand, [the bank bailouts were loans, not free money for the rich, and have been repaid to the extent of interest profits for the governments/taxpayers](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/).
Vote harder, bro.
I still haven't read a compelling argument to why we should have let the financial system crumble in 2008. Sure a lot of money was thrown at entities that should have failed like GM but letting your banks fail is as close to Greece as you can get.

From what I have read in other articles, it is the government that did not act on renewal, and the license is in force until the government takes action.  It has been very unclear from every article why the government continues to take no action.  You would think that government would at least be increasing their revenue from the well.
Yea I work for a BLM office in Colorado, shit like this happens all the time and at our level its really not within our power to go after all of them to enforce it unless it becomes an issue. I wish all of these ignorant cunts would not use this as a platform to attack the government. Nestle and the USFS have done nothing wrong here, at most the USFS should charge them back fees for not renewing the licence, but they still have legal right to take the water. The BLM, USFS and FWS are very good organizations that have done more to protect this country that most of you know. Shit most of the time we cannot protect things because of public ignorance stopping us.

Hey here's one for you..    
A Paper mill uses about 10,000 gallons of water to produce 1 ton of paper and produces 450,000 tons of paper pr year.    
That is 13,800 acre feet or 4,496,743,800 gallons. Yes 4.4 Billion gallons of water a year for 1 mill.    
Nestle total water use from all sources was 2,148 acre feet (700 million gallons)    
[Cali has 42 paper mills](http://www.cpbis.gatech.edu/data/mills-online-new?state=California)    


Now  some articles I've read claimed Nestlee's 700 million gallons could irrigate 700 acres of farm lad. 1 million gallons pr acre.     

Cali has 7.9 million acres of irrigated farm land.   

ready?   

7,900,000,000,000 gallons.. 7.9 Trillion...  Now how much of the problem is Nestle?

I don't see them trying to cut back on agricultural and livestock farming. 90% of water use but apparently not a problem.
Source? Because I've seen this Nestl√© story on here multiple times but I've never seen anything about farmers or ranchers wasting water. 
Central CA irrigation district is paying $17 pr acre foot (325,851 gallons) [Source](http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/California-drought-Charge-true-cost-of-water-6319943.php)

Nestle got 24 million gallons or 73.65 acre feet from Arrowhead springs last year.  That would be $1,252 at the ag rate.

Even if they were made to pay the Tier II suplemental pool rate of $272 pr AF [source](http://www.ccidwater.org/Allocations%202-3-14.pdf)  they would only pay $20,000

adding "make highly addictive catfood" to my list of reasons to get my pitchfork
[deleted]
If she gets hungry enough she'll eat.  If Nestle is making her food, its probably not the best quality anyway - go get her something that will make her healthy and won't contribute to the destruction of the planet.
You can buy cat food at those organic shops.  I don't know if what's in the can/bag is any better, but a lot of those companies make an effort to have a low carbon footprint and generally not be dicks to the Earth.  The trade off is the price.  But check out a shop, then do some research and back the company that you want to support because it aligns with your moral standing.  It's really all any of us can do: vote with our measly dollars.  
  
I somehow have managed to sidestep all Nestle products inadvertently, except for fucking one: Nescafe.  Their instant coffee is the most non-shit one on the shelf, and I just moved to a country where large black coffees don't exist.  As a result I never eat chocolate bars, and go out of my way to avoid supporting any other things they make.  
I think mine might be one of those too. What food do you use? I know at least one on that list has proven to kill cats 
My dog will only eat Kibbles & Crack. I keep trying to get him to kick the habit but he gets all resentful.
Blend new food with old food to phase new food into her diet, while decreasing the old food daily. She's less likely to have tummy problems this way. But yeah, dont buy her that garbage any more. The extra ten dollars on higher quality food may increase longevity. 
The bigger issue is how little Nestl√© is paying.

Those golf courses are probably paying market price or a bit more which in California seems to be a bit over $3/748 gallons so they're paying $300M per year which is about the price of a big desalination plant.  When your state is desperate for water its silly to give any away especially when making more costs you $5/ccf
You don't expect rich people to play on dry grass do you? 
The AG industry is even worse. Almost all the shit Nestle is getting is propaganda pushed by the AG industry to keep the heat of themselves.
And California as a whole uses 38B gallons of water a day, that's 13.87T a year.  We are crying about golf courses that bring in a lot of money for using .5% of California's annual water usage and Nestle for taking .0002%.
Not only that, but any water that is bottled is going the be utilized more efficiently than water in any municipal system. People are less likely to waste water they pay several cents an ounce for vs several cents per gallon.
I mean, it's really just the excess of corn we were already making to feed the cattle, which is a fucking ridiculous amount of water wasted already (something like 500 gallons of water per pound of beef? I can't remember right now). Then, when we have too much corn, we start making sugar out of it, a la HFCS or partially hydrogenated corn products. Then, after that, when there is STILL corn left over, we use it to enrich our foods, or for packaging, or for  beauty products, artificial sweeteners- or whatever else you could imagine- and then finally, it goes to our cars in the form of ethanol. 
I do know Ethanol gunks up engines a lot quicker than pure gasoline. So essentially shortening the lifespan of your vehicles motor. It is also terrible for older car engines where it eats away at seals and valve seats.
Perhaps the message is less about Nestle and more about the government giving away public resources? The article points out that Nestle only pays $524 a year to pull as many as 28 million gallons of water a year. Stopping the government from allowing corporations to profitize public resources seems like a good thing, even if it won't directly solve the drought.

The other issue, besides being Nestle, is where the specific water is located. This changes the discussion from slightly lower reservoirs to potentially impacting the long term health of a national forest.
Reclaimed water. It's an important distinction.
This drop of water is going to distract from real problems, wasting government resources that could have otherwise filled the bucket.
This is a way for the anti-corporation crowd to try to rope people concerned about water into attacking a random corporation over a negligible amount of the water supply. If they win this battle it will be the lawn in front of McDonalds, the water Wal-mart uses to wash off its trucks, and the low efficiency toilets in the Starbucks bathroom.

Time and resources and attention are finite, they can't be spent on this when there are easily addressable things that could be changed with a thousand times the impact.
It makes for an easy scapegoat. But I guess it's the American way of life now a days. Nestl√© uses about as much as a cattle farmer wastes on a couple thousand catle meanwhile Nestl√© is vilified. 
Nestle doesn't seem to have done anything illegal.
> the case here has a decent chance of actually making a difference

What difference?  The 0.01% difference?
Nestle didn't steal, the government officials didn't do their job. Nestle is a distraction, get it?

Why, looking for your peer group?
They are the agricultural powerhouse of the US and grow many of the fruits and vegetables found in the foods you eat every day

https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/
25 million gallons per year is about 68,000ish per day. 
Lots of people in have a 35,000ish gallon swimming pool. 
An olympics sized pool holds 250,000,000L (or 66 million gallons)... At 500mL standard bottles (Standard Poland Spring bottles) that's 475 million bottles accounting 5% for spillage and waste through the process.  Sounds like a shit ton of profit and waste with that much plastic used in the bottles and packaging, not to mention fuel used for delivery and transport.

Nestle is at most breaking the law, legally the cow cunts are with in their rights, the law is the law and no one man or organisation should be above it. It is irrelevant if farmers rape the water if they legally rape it.
Doesn't really make a difference, just replace "California" with "the US" in my post.

That's wrong in many ways.  The bank bailouts extended far, far beyond TARP.  Among other things, the FED still has trillions in garbage assets that it bought from the banks.  The FED continues to give free money to the banks by loaning them money at 0% which they turn around and loan out at 5-20%.  

But for the sake of argument, let's assume you were right.  I'll offer this analogy.  

I'm a rich guy playing roulette table.  I'm down $1 million dollars.  I have no more money.  Joe comes along, and loans me $50,000.  I put that $50,000 on number 23.  It comes in, I win 1.75 million dollars.  I pay back Joe his $50,000 plus "interest" of $5,000.  That remaining $1.695 million goes in my pocket.  That $1.695 million was "free money for the rich".  It was not my money I was risking on my gamble, it was Joe's.  Joe took all the risk, and I reaped all the rewards. 
I think the biggest problem is that literally nothing happened to curb their behavior. Yeah, bailing them out might have been the only feasible thing to do since we let the situation get so bad in the first place, but did we make them feel the pain of their mismanagement? Did we impose strict regulations on the system that very clearly couldn't be trusted to manage itself? Did we jail the executives who knowingly committed predatory financial behavior and who gambled away all of our money? Did we bring to task the political environment that allowed such corruption to exist?

No, we did not. The companies got their bailout and nothing happened. Those responsible are free to keep on keeping on, and do as they please. And unfortunately it doesn't look likely to change in the near future.
Because "we" had no say in it.  As long as people keep handing money over to the govt, they will continue spending it as the please.
Iceland is the only good example out of the whole shitty mess. Their bank execs are still in prison.
Because there isn't s compelling argument. Bailing out the banks was the right thing to do for the country. However, the fact that there wasn't a single bank executive charged/convicted with fraud is disgusting. The banks responsible should have been forced to fire everyone involved and many bank execs should be in prison. 
I mean, eroding constitutional rights fits right into what he's talking about, are you really so dumb to think it's otherwise?
Maybe they should stop saying they are going to take them as soon as they have enough power.
I'm not an expert on government licenses but this makes the situation make more sense. It does make me wonder now what grounds do those suing the government have? It's not like its illegal to not take action on a license renewal is it? 
I work for a state government dealing with air pollution permits. It's not quite the same thing, but there are lots of reasons why we wouldn't take action on a permit renewal right away. Most of them boil down to more permit renewals than there are staff to process them (thanks budget cuts!), but there are other reasons to.

For example, if nothing is changing with the renewal, then there's really no harm in letting the company continue to operate under their existing permit since the renewed permit will be exactly the same. These end up on the bottom of the pile while I spend my limited man hours on new projects or other renewals where something is changing. 

The "problem" here is that something that has been a non-issue for a while is suddenly an issue because something else happened (i.e. the drought). If there were no drought, this company would continue to operate as they have been for years with no one any the wiser. 
When the government is small enough, then keeping Nestle under control would not even be the government's job in the first place. Then what happens?
Welcome to New Jersey
> So that corruption can be multiplied and more easily unchecked?

Because the state would be more likely to act in this case than the federal government.
Corruption is a human trait that involves attaining too much power, so no, increasing government isn't the answer. This brings unhappiness to constituents as the echo chamber between citizens and their representation becomes longer and harder to control (like today). It gives too much power to too few people.

When undeclared wars sizzle third world countries and our voices aren't loud enough to stop insurance companies from physically lobbying for higher medical costs in DC,  I think smaller, more manageable government might at least be up for consideration for everyone.

I mean,  what is government supposed to be for us?

Government shouldn't have a goal or agenda.  It should be to protect and defend its citizens like a fence around a garden

When is it supposed to get good, if it's glory days are always on the horizon and never now?

Just a thought.  Nobody really knows what's going on (least I don't)
No.  Smaller local governments would only have a small fraction of the resources and power that the central govt has.  Meaning less incentive for corruption, less ability to cover up corruption, and governments that are actually in touch with the people they claim to serve.  




Strictly speaking, nothing can be proven outside of hard math so you're whole point is moot. You can't mathematically prove an apple is an apple I guess apples must not be apples.
 
So do half the eligible voters.
We may vote for our representatives but it does not exactly mean they represent our interests. That's why it's called a democracy in disguise.  
I like the part where the voting has nothing to do with the fact that we are technically still an oligarchy because our society is ruled by an elite, wealthy class of few. 
voting left or right no other choice and both  parties are essentially the same putting each people in place put forward in the first place by other rich people.

yeah totally a democracy if you compare it to a multiple party system in any other real democracy... ‡≤†_‡≤†
Well he did say technically, literally.... This new definition of literally that Webster's Dictionary allowed is very confusing. 
It's called [inverted totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism).  It occurs when the wealthy corrupt and subvert democracy effectively creating a totalitarian state and, while there are elections, the outcome of those elections is controlled by the wealthy elite and the electorate is basically prevented from having any real impact on government policy.
There are quite a few countries with essentially dictators that hold elections. That in and of itself only counts for so much 
How about the part where the popular vote didn't matter?  Like in 2000, 1888, 1876, and 1824?

Many golf course use reclaimed water  - treated water from sanitary - which is much cheaper if not free.
Which is why Nestl√©'s CEO was completely correct when he said that the cause of California's drought is that water is too cheap and if water would be sold at market value people who are actually wasting it would have to reduce usage.
$3/748 gal? Wtf
Those golf courses also didn't build their own 4 mile pipeline system from the water source, move it by truck from there, build out a filtration system and pay to maintain it.

I would guess that a large portion of your city supplied water cost pr gallon goes to infrastructure, distribution  and maintenance costs.
$6.5 for 748gal in SF, which for most customers is really $13/ccf because you pay the same to put it down the drain, more if you have non-standard wastewater.
IIRC when the whole nestle issue first came up we found that Nestle was paying the same market price as everyone else. They weren't getting a deal on it. 
Not only do they bring in a lot of money per year but they keep wealth here too in the form of rich ass residents.  

Even still though, 0.5% is still 1 out of every 200 gallons that gets used.  It is quite a bit of water and as much as California needs money it needs water too.   Arguably more so.   Methinks there is a balance to be struck somewhere.

Honestly we need to reevaluate our use in all areas in the face of this drought.  Now that water is a bigger factor in the equation be just need to rebalance everything.   It means cutting out the fat like nestle and unsustainable crops.  It also means figuring out how to keep the stuff we need while throwing less water at it.  

But since politicians are in charge we are kind of boned.  We will just yell and point fingers until everyone dies in the California Desert.  Too bad we need immediate drastic action in a system built to prohibit that sort of thing.  
It's not excess corn. Ethanol is mandated in our fuel system and is basically purpose grown for the ethanol industry for that reason. If you look at corn acreage pre and post RFS, you will see a dramatic run up.

Thanks buddy
It is still a huge amount of water that is being taken from a nature preserve for free during a drought. It is an issue & it should be tackled. This also brings attention to the water conservation issue & lets other people know they can sue over such a fundamental resource as water.

.01% for water usage. But a possibly greater reach beyond that. Also, millions of gallons of water might be percentage wise small, but it's not a small amount of water by any means.

I think you may have read his/her comment a bit hard there.  I took it as hippies are just picking on nestle because of the media spin when there are bigger culprits yet the same hippies do nothing about those because who cares about xyz golf course when they can use a well known company like nestle as a scape goat.  
So let's repeat, Nestl√© uses a completely irrelevant amount of water. The fact that corporations can buy water so cheap is a problem, but Nestl√© are not the ones doing it. Even if Nestl√© completely ceased operations in California, your water bill would not be affected.
>Nestle is at most breaking the law

What law are they breaking? 

I always thought they are within the law. 
I would be more likely to believe that if there weren't examples of countries that do a better job than America. 

I do agree that we live in an oligarchy, and that the government is often corrupt. But that doesn't mean ditching the government altogether, but to put it back into the hands of the people. 

Do you have an idea for a different solution?
They are doing it for different reasons but the main thing is that no one has done any studies or made them redo the permit which would cost them a lot more today then what they pay now. It's mostly just a blind eye being turned until things get as bad as they are and now people are noticing. It's been a long running problem but the lack of rain has brought it up more. 
Hahaha, this boy.  "Blame it on the hippies!" "Blame it on the farmers!" "Blame anyone but the company because I invested in their stock and now I have to change things".  Just be honest dude. But stop for a sec and look.

They literally took water from an area specifically set aside for the public, and are being allowed to sell consumable goods taken out of that area.  The farmers apply for water use and pay for it, Nestle simply *inherited* the permit that it never applied for, it only purchased it from the previous rights holder circumventing the system set up.  This was a park setup for the public there, so clearly you're not from that area or you'd understand why you're position gives away that you're concerned about money more than you're worried about the farmers or the hippies.  You can't fake around that.  Nobody is upset if you care about money, just stop deflecting the issue and be honest because you give away your intention anyway.  Blaming hippies and farmers?  You know this is reddit, right?

Yeah this is what shocked me. Nothing happened. The only result is that, at least in the UK, we now own a couple of banks outright, but last I heard we were looking at selling the shares off at a massive loss. It seems clear to me that, with the amount of shady business going on that lead to the 2008 crash there must have been at least some breaches of regulations and crimes. There is at the very least reasonable suspicion that those things occurred. But there has been no criminal investigation (at least here), but even if no crimes were committed, *we haven't even checked to see if that is true*. We didn't even bother.
They have influence and the issues/blame can be spread out through the entire system. I'm also upset nothing of any substance was done
That's awful justification. You want to talk about accountability that's one thing, letting the financial system fall our from under us doesn't fix that problem either. I mean things would probably be better in the long run but between the whole dying in the long run and all the suffering in the short run I think the right call was made. I disagree with certain aspects of it but overall a decent idea. They could have used the money to give to citizens so they could spend more but that's still a bailout. You can make a much better argument for why we shouldn't have done QE. 
It wasn't that long ago that the US jailed bank executives.  Hundreds of people were convicted as part of the Savings and Loan crisis including many executives.
I've spent the last few years honestly trying to comprehend how the situation plays out in the head of those that are pro bank failure. Also, you said bank execs should be in jail, why? Sure they are greedy pigs but that's what we expect of them, what did they do you'd consider illegal? 
> It's not like its illegal to not take action on a license renewal is it?

Not really, and there are [hundreds out of permit licenses that are out of date.](http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2015/07/23/review-nestle-water-permit-neglected-decades/30562241/)  The lawsuit will likely be based on the governments failure to meet the the standards they set for themselves.  Even if they start, the government will still likely take years to complete the necessary review.

It's not necessarily illegal, but because of the potential consequences and water use rights it can be argued that allowing a company access to a lot of inexpensive water is wrong. Basically, water rights are a big deal and different people have different opinions about what that water should be used for. The group that is suing in this case is interested in safeguarding that water for conservation and wildlife, other groups may agree with the lawsuiy because they feel that the water should be distributed in a more fair manner. They may feel that it's unfair for nestle to have cheap access to water on an expired permit when someone else in similar circumstances would have to pay significantly more. (A farmer might want to use that water for example and he doesn't get to use it, and nestle is paying less than he would in the same circumstance)
How is that logic?
Nestle still has to follow local laws just like you would.
I have never used any of those words to describe my local or state government. Mayors and school boards are full of corruption, state reps are nearly impossible to oust due to gerrymandering, local positions are filled by cronyism. Local and state government are corrupt with less oversight than the federal level.
If that's the case your whole point is moot as well. It all depends on what philosophical lense you choose to view things from.

People tend to like water even more.
no the thing is that farmers make up a large portion of the voting base. Nestle is involved in food too. 
Golf courses don't use as much as you'd think, and tend to use reclaimed water.
That all seems insanely cheap. Why is it so inexpensive?

Sorry, couldn't really take any of your points seriously after you start off with the "I hate rich people and only rich people play golf" bullshit.  Golf is a multibillion industry and effects more than 100,000 jobs in California.  Even someone who hates golf should at least be able to understand the economic impact.  Even the article you cite mentions how golf courses are doing everything they can to limit water usage.

Nestle is selling California drought water to places that don't have a water shortage. That seems like a poor use of the resource. That they pay so little is a problem, but the idea that this company is moving water from an area without much water to areas with no shortage is, at the least, a bad PR move. When there is a shortage, a government backed exportation is going to draw fire, and rightly so.
They operated for 27 years without a permit. From the article....

>At the heart of the suit by the Story of Stuff Project, the California-based Courage Campaign Institute and the Center for Biological Diversity is the allegation that the service shouldn't allow Nestl√© to use the water from Strawberry Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest because the use permit in question expired in 1988.

Wrong. No one is blaming them just they are being hypocrites. They don't really care about water use or else they go after things that really matter in terms of water use.

Here's what the head of the League of Women Voters said when they stopped hosting the debates:

> Never in the history of the League of Women Voters have two candidates' organizations come to us with such stringent, unyielding and self-serving demands..."

Well, if it fits the definition of the word "Oligarchy" then you're right to call it that.

a form of government in which all power is vested in a few persons or in a dominant class or clique; government by the few.

That makes sense. And the government probably should have done something about it before hand. What I think a lot of people are over looking is the fact that the government lets this kind of stuff happen all the time. I don't think they had any bad intentions, but with so many licenses to keep track of and with the slow moving nature of government paper work, things like this often go neglected. 
Without the shared resource of tax dollars of the society that lives there, the laws would be created by the organisations with the money to do so. Those would be self-serving laws. We created government for the greater good, and I do realise that gets in the way of some greedy individuals who would rather not have that government telling them what they can't do.
Unless it just buys the local government through bribes, mind of like how it has
Everything is corruptable in politics, so it makes sense to keep power and resources spread thinner as to reduce the influence of those corruptions.  

The federal government lacks oversight.  State and local governments are far easier to keep track of, due to their limited power and their incentive to actually be concerned with what the populace wants, and are better able to serve their populace than the out of touch, incompetent, and wasteful federal government.  

State governments just don't have the abundance of resources that allows the federal government to essentially do whatever it pleases.  It's unlikely that a state government would have the resources to wiretap, intercept texts and emails or otherwise spy on its populace.  State governments certainly would not have the resources to sustain perpetual foreign wars, the war on drugs, and despicable organizations like the DEA, CIA, FBI, NSA, CPS, and of course the TSA.  There would be no Patriot Act or TPP.

Of course none of that applies to places like NYC, but places like that are doomed by their large dense populations.  
The majority of agricultural production in california comes from the Sacramento River valley and the San Joaquin valley, among the most viable agricultural regions in human history.
Hard to say.. 

Hey here's one for you..    

A Paper mill uses about 10,000 gallons of water to produce 1 ton of paper and produces 450,000 tons of paper pr year.    

That is 13,800 acre feet  or 4,496,743,800 gallons. Yes 4.4 Billion gallons of water a year for 1 mill.

Nestle total water use from all sources was 2,148 acre feet (700 million gallons) 

[Cali has 42 paper mills](http://www.cpbis.gatech.edu/data/mills-online-new?state=California)

Now  some articles I've read claimed Nestlee's 700 million gallons could irrigate 700 acres of farm lad. 1 million gallons pr acre.     

Cali has 7.9 million acres of irrigated farm land.   

ready?   

7,900,000,000,000 gallons.. 7.9 Trillion...  Now how much of the problem is Nestle?

Thanks. I am hopefully in the clear. Checking out other options now. I am trying to avoid Nestle as much as possible anyways.

I mostly feed my cats wet food (friskies) and also offer them some grainfree kibble. This way, at least my ones, don't over eat as they know, they always have food available.

edit: word
Must be a Californian thing. I pay per thousand gallons. Granted they round my bill to the closest thousand, but in the end at most it cost me an extra 1-2 dollars a month. 
You missed the parts where I didn't say anything about hating evil rich people and where I actually said that the golf courses are part of what brings them and their money to California and how that's a good thing.
Oh I see, there was too many BS comments so I stopped reading so I didnt get far.  Thanks for explaining.
No hippies aren't bad just misguided here. Nestl√© uses an infinitesimal percentage amount of water and hippies are going after them like there's no tomorrow. Meanwhile agriculture and livestock farmers use up 90% of the water without any cutbacks and no one bats an eye. If we really cared about water we would see ecological organizations advocating for a temporary break in eating meat since a pound of beef uses about 600 gallons of water. Shutting down Nestl√© is the equivalent of about an additional  100,000 California's only eating meat once a week. 

Imagine the water savings if the eco hippies advocating the entire state to go meat free 3 or 4 nights a week. MIND BLOWN üíßüíßüíßüíß
Thats definitely true, but the majority of people don't know any of them.  Even if they named them and location and net worth or whatever, it doesn't have the same media impact as nestle. 
The person watering the garden uses irrelevant amounts of water, just like Nestl√©, but the person watering his garden isn't being blamed for the drought.
Yeah I read that but in the article it also says

>Under current Forest Service policy and regulation, Nestl√© is authorized to transmit water across NFS [National Forest Service] lands under the terms of its original permit while the renewal application is processed.

Now obviously a renewal process of 27 years is unacceptable but that is on the forest service and not Nestle. 
That isn't correct. They have a permit that expired and needed to be reviewed but till it was the permit was extended till such a time. The people at the park kept saying they didn't have the budget to process all the permits and well government paperwork. So it is still a legal permit that is temporally extended for pretty much ever, if this hadn't come into the media light it would have kept on this way.

So in short they are still legally allowed to pump that water but I am surprised no one just blew up the pipe yet. The parts in the forest are mostly above ground.
>the answer is to remove the ability of the government to affect outcomes.

If I misinterpreted this, what was your actual intention?
They're not being hypocrites. The farmers pay taxes.  Nestle goes across to Canada and bottles it and sells it.  So they literally take away from tax money, and avoid having to pay in the first place.  

The farmers *give* and *take*.  Nestle simply *takes*.  I'm not sure why you're so determined to change the focus away from Nestle.

The Keating 5 were just the Senators accused of corruption.
Yeah, but at the rate of increasing production of livestock and use of water for that is nearly depleting that reserve. Just because its the most viable place for agriculture, doesn't mean it's infinitely self sustaining.
Well at my house I pay like 10 bucks per 1000 gallons so I'm getting ass raped compared to these prices. Why do they get water so cheap.

Thank you for the correction. I was just a lad when the whole thing went down.
This is true, however to imply that California is some desolate desert and we're shipping and consuming water in a place we have no business doing so is just wrong. California has some of the best agricultural lands on the planet, what's a travesty is cementing it all and building houses on it.
Are the farmers not farming for profit? It's not like the water disappears after it gets bottled.

With the electoral college in place we are technically a Republic, not a democracy. We haven't been a democracy for a long time.
You can vote, but does it matter anymore? Through gerrymandered districts, regardless of your vote, your district will almost always elect for one of two parties, parties which weren't intended to become staples of US governance in the beginning. Parties which are funded and controlled by wealthy investors who pay representatives to ignore the concerns of their constituents in order to line their pockets, destroying the representative nature of a democratic republic. You can vote, but if your ballot is on the wrong color it doesn't matter, and if it's on the right color, your voice will land on deaf ears. Our system has been eroded by the currents of currency.
>The fact that you can still vote would be a strong argument.

It isn't complete bs to feel like you can't do anything. Individually we cannot. The country appears to be acting like an oligarchy because the citizens are too apathetic to shift it back towards the representative democracy. It also doesn't help that there's plenty of stuff out there to distract the populace from the real issues we have in the country. 
If the representatives we elect don't follow through and represent us then it's not representative. 
Agreed, pushing for better agricultural practices would go a long way as well as not developing every possible inch of land... but you're going to have to convince the masses that climate change is real and environmental damage matters. As it stands, humans only care about the here and now as opposed to what may happen in 15 years.
I hear Flint might be willing to help them out. 
Nestl√© is stealing everyone's water.

http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/nestle-water-guelph-1.3841508
Let's make sure that ALL residents of the state have safe drinking water first, shall we? 
maybe people should stop buying bottle water..
Not to rain on the Nestle hate parade, but 400 gpm is a fraction of what water treatment plants pull from water sources every day.  This includes groundwater. 

For example:  A water treatment plant pulling from pool 3 of the Kentucky River has the capacity to treat and deliver up to 30 million gallons per day. That's 20,833 gallons per minute, and this is a relatively small plant.   Saint Louis County, for example has multiple plants that can handle up to or over 100 million gallons per day (69,444 gpm). 

Bottom line here is that Nestle is pulling a minuscule amount of water from one of the largest fresh water sources on the planet. 

Maybe the state could use a PPP strategy to get Nestle to invest some money in the water infrastructure. That would be better than them pulling their water from a place where water is more scarce. 
>"400gpm seems like too much." 

Well then stop guessing and do some research. Determine the area of concern, install some monitoring wells, and measure the groundwater level as you pump. 
Clean water is essentially an energy problem. If we had a clean, plentiful energy supply (Like good old nuclear) we could make all of the clean water we would ever need. It really annoys me that good, clean and powerful technology like Nuclear has been crippled by fear mongering and lobbying and as a result we are fucked in every way possible.
If they're willing to pay for it, why not?
anyone know if there is a specific place i can make a donation to fuck nestle over? fuck nestle!
My real question is why government's are so willing to give them permits to take water at such discounted rates compared to what the public pays.  It just screams of corruption.

Seeks to ourchase rights from a seller.
There has to be someone selling the water that Nestle buys, right?
So, why isn't the outrage directed towards the guys pawning off the resource to the highest bidder?
Its sad that people still buy their products even after all the bullshit they pull on local watersheds for communities that rely on the water. Fuck Nestl√©.
And the residents of Flint can't even drink their tap water. 
As a Michigan native, they can fuck right off. 
Stop buying this stuff, stop complaining,  go to the store and buy a filter
then they can sell it to the city of flint, which has to give bottled water to the residents, perfect business model 
Nestle shrewdly figured out a long time ago that weapons may always hold the Number 1 Power slot, but water trickles in as a sneaky second.

They've been very forthcoming, (as has Monsanto) about their conviction that water is and should be a commercial commodity, as well as their intention to buy the rights to all of it.

As a population reduction/adjustment tool, it's not as instant as bombs, but once the up-front work is done, neither does it have the resource-intensive outlay requirements for even a single use.

Armed or not, once water is secured, human beings can only constitute an impediment for a few days.
Having driven past both of their plants in the area, there is little to no work in the surrounding areas.  It's all farm country, for 60 miles in every direction.  I'm not saying that as an excuse, but for the locals, it's a double edged sword.  If they work at the plant, it is the only place to work (with the exception of some small restaurants and 5&10 stores.)  As a resident of Michigan, I would like to see some limits on their production, and verification's that they are sticking to the allotted amount.
I dispise these companies ruining the ecosystems they drain. 
So I get free water at work(duh) but anyways it's nestle and I just realized that while reading this article. I didn't read the label
Whhhhyyyy
New Nestle brand water.  It's called FLINT.
From the company that:

Marketed baby formula to new mothers in poor countries violating a World Health Organization marketing Code

Employed Child Slave labor to pick cacao

Hired a private security company to infiltrate an anti-globalization group

AND had the gall to sell us bottled water whose name is "naive" backwards

Comes...

oh whatever...

clearly no one gives a shit what these assholes do.
There's a guy from Nestl√© that doesn't think water is a human right. I mean, that guy should be hunt down and shot. He works at Nestl√©, you're supposed to be happy making cocoa for people and this guy's going, "Well, people are running out of water. >:) What if we OWN all the water and we kept it under OUR place and in the future when everybody's...- [Bill Burr on Conan] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pb6r8VNWk)
I don't understand how Nestle still exists.  I've never heard of them doing a single good thing.  Wasn't there a boycott like 30 years ago?  When they gave third world countries powdered milk and told them it's better than breastfeeding, meanwhile they have to mix said powder with polluted water.


Which one of you dipshits still buys their stuff?  How has the government not banned them from the country?  
Those damn greedy paint companies want to extract that sweet Michigan lead!
Send an email to MDEQ. There's the email at the bottom of the article. We have until November 3rd to tell MDEQ to stop raping our water supply.
I can see the lake Michigan getting smaller by the minute! Stop it, Nestle!
These are the kinds of bad deals I hope Trump is serious about rolling back. 
More water?

wow, I heard NESTLE wants to go to Mars to take all the water from there as well.
Yeah, nobody fucking likes Nestle. But they pay their campaign contributions and therefore have free reign to do what they like.

They just fucking took a whole well here in Ontario, lobbying against a small town - fucking criminal both this horseshit stain of a company and Canadian politics. #grabnestlebythepussy
Nestle should fuck off.  
Good thing I just bought some more stock from them. Also it's always funny to see uninformed idiots complain about things they don't understand.
This has got to stop.  These companies, and Nestle is the worst, take our water, make a 1200% markup and sell it back to us.  Our own water.
Sure. They can have the whole Flint river.
They can have all the Flint water they want.
I read a leaked memo from Nestle that the company's next steps are to find ways to obtain and harvest the blood of kids from Flint. Scary stuff.
Make them move all operation to flint Michigan two birds baby
Why is Nestle becoming this unethical water sucking scourge? Do they think that's going to work out well for them in the long run?  It seems like a PR disaster waiting to happen.
Nestl√© is fucked up real bad! No wonder my friend doesn't want me eating Nestl√© chocolate. I wonder if the future will be like Waterworld with Kevin Costner. The setting of the film is in the distant future. Although no exact date was given in the film itself, it has been suggested that it takes place in 2500. The polar ice caps have completely melted, and the sea level has risen over 7,600 m (25,000 feet), covering nearly all the land. Wikipedia gives the best descriptions. I couldn't have done it better myself! Polar caps melt causing the world to be flooded with water! Chaos ensues for aeons. 
Hey Michigan!  This is what happens when you vote in shitty Repub governors, shitty Tea Party reps to Congress and let their friends rape you!

But no, you have to lift Il Douche to the presidency, too!

When the fuck are you going to start taking your own interests seriously?
F U Nestl√©. That's my clean drinking water. Back the fuck up ‚úãüò°
Nestl√© apparently really have a thing for grabbing all the remaining potable water in the areas the most drought-struck shortest-possible on potable water.
Nestle will be the Zorg industries of the future. Headed by Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg.
If no one owns it, then they have every right to take it. If someone else owns it, then this is between them and Nestle.

If someone is kinda-sorta using it, then Nestle needs to compensate them too. ([Externalities are addressed by internalizing the problem via private property rights.](https://books.google.com/books?id=hRbTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=noise+pollution+mises&source=bl&ots=rf1M0hYTD3&sig=uvF-PVU9jE55Nw122f7MFo2sl-o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOwpeb-MvQAhVK7oMKHfH7B60Q6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&q=noise%20pollution%20mises&f=false)) Michigan should not own anything.

I'm always perplexed by a society that views selling as theft and tax as... Something else.

Latest Nestle Water Brand

It'll knock you out with flavor and minerals.
"If you're not crazy about our new Flint water, then you haven't been drinking it.
There's nothing wrong with Flint's water supply at the intake pipe. Nestle would be perfectly happy with it if they got a feed early in the system.

It's Flint's plumbing that sucks.
That's where the bottled water is going.
shit.. I Was just going to say that
I'm work in Flint, live about ten mins away from downtown. All around on public bus stops you almost always see a 24 pack of water for anyone. Damn corporate greed can flush out of water that would be nice. 
[removed]
that corp is evil to the core. "water is not a right" they say...

ok lets take away water from the ceo's and see what they think about that after 48 hours.
They aren't 'stealing' shit, the states are giving it to them free and clear, even inviting them to do it in some cases. Don't like it? talk to the state agency in charge to letting a company set up shop and syphon off all the water they can sell all the while the citizens pay more for it everyday. 
This is some Bond villain level shit going on. 
saw water bottles in canada and only saw nestle, as much as i wanted water i had to pass. evil evil company

> Nestl√© is stealing everyone's water

Why? If people weren't buying it, you'd think they'd stop. I mean, fuck Nestle for being evil, but fuck us for enabling them. 
I don't think you understand what stealing means.
Michigan is one of the most water-abundant place in the US, possibly the world. There's enough for everyone there. It's not a resource that's exhausted either, it's replenished constantly. 
false - they're welcome to my neighbor's share of the water.  
Pretty sure they are buying it, just like everybody else.
Stealing?

If we start charging Nestle for the amount of water they currently take (which is relatively paltry in volume), then we have to charge everyone else the same amount because of NAFTA. Goodbye farmers, goodbye brewers, goodbye everyone who depends on access to free water.

Currently, water is regulated such that companies can't take an ecologically irresponsible volume. Nestle takes less **yearly** than Toronto does **daily**. 

If we *charge* for water rather than *regulate access to the infrastructure*, way more people will be unhappy. **Water is free for everyone - you are allowed to construct a well and extract an absurd amount.** Access to water through developed infrastructure is not free, but it has to be cheap for our farmers.
Oh, The corruption goes even deeper than people just not having safe drinking water. 

>One reason the Nestl√© operation in Michigan has been controversial is that Deb Muchmore, a lobbyist and public relations consultant who has served as a Michigan spokeswoman for the company, is the spouse of Dennis Muchmore, who until January was chief of staff to Gov. Rick Snyder. The Free Press reported in February that in March 2015, Dennis Muchmore proposed spending $250,000 to buy bottled water for Flint from either Nestl√© or Absopure, a competitor. "How about cutting a deal with Ice Mountain," which is bottled by Nestl√©, "or (Absopure Water board member) Bill Young and buying some water for the people for a time?‚Äù Muchmore asked in a March 3, 2015, e-mail. He added that ‚Äú$250,000 buys a lot of water, and we could distribute it through the churches while we continue to make the water even safer."
But then rich corporations  won't make money off are suffering! 

Edit-Our 
There isn't anything wrong with the source water, the issue is the pipes, Nestle or whatever company that uses that water isn't taking anything from anyone.

Michigan doesn't have a water problem, they have a water infrastructure problem.
[deleted]
but if you do that, how will nestle increase it's quarterly sales?
We have safe water. Flint doesn't have safe pipes, and they're getting it from a contaminated source. 

It's not like there's some shortage of water here in michigan. have you looked at Michigan on a map? There's plenty of fresh, easily cleaned water for the state.
Maybe we should all drink the water so there's none left for Nestle 
I live in Denmark and I've never really understood why you're so big consumers of bottled water. 

Is it because of poor water quality?
And what good would that do?
576,000 gallons per day is what Nestle wants to do...


This is 2010 data from [USGS](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mi/nwis/water_use?format=html_table&rdb_compression=file&wu_area=State+Total&wu_year=2010&wu_category=ALL&wu_category_nms=--ALL%2BCategories--) as they don't have 2015 data available yet.  They do it every 5 years.
This is old data sure, since then I'm sure it has gone down in quite a few counties, but this is what is readily available for this.

Public Use - 204.30 Million Gallons per day from fresh groundwater.

Public Use - 883.39 Million Gallons per day from fresh surface water.

I like to argue that the Nestle problem is that the people posting about it don't quite know what they are talking about and only read about what Nestle did in the past.  The water issue isn't even an issue, 500,000 compared to 200 million and 800 million is completely dumb to argue.  That is quite a drop in the bucket, wah they want to sell you fresh.. clean.. water locally as most water isn't shipped out of state but used in state, get over it and have fun with your lead poisoning.

If you want to get mad, get mad at the government that allows them to buy cheap water.
> Nestle is pulling a minuscule amount of water from one of the largest fresh water sources

Plus, I'd rather have Nextle water that is sourced locally, than Evian or Perier water that pollutes by being transported around half the world frist.

Exactly. Also cities lose enormous amount of water in leaking pipes because it's often cheaper to pump extra water than fixing the pipes. 

They could probably use the extra money to fix pipes and end up pumping less water.
If you want to throw a shit fit about water go look at water use in paper mills.

[On Average it takes 16,000 gallons pr ton of paper.](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/1920/tps-601.pdf)        
The Port Huron mill alone produces 114,000 tons of paper a year.    
http://domtarpapertrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PortHuronMill_FactSheet.pdf   
1,824,000,000 gallons a year     
8.6 X more than Nestlee's proposed new water rate. 
Yes that is almost 2 billion gallons for one mill.    
[Michigan has 49 paper mills](http://www.cpbis.gatech.edu/data/mills-online-new?state=Michigan)

You know who else has 49 paper mills? [California](http://www.cpbis.gatech.edu/data/mills-online-new?state=California).. Think about that..

That's smaller than any power plant or major industrial plant would pull. It's a practically insignificant amount of water from any major waterway. 
A bit off topic, by why do we use "a fraction of"? 1/100,000 is just as much a fraction as 99/100, isn't it?
This is so short sighted I'm actually appauled you thought it was a good idea to post.   There is no close limiting them to 400gpm for the next 50years.   They aren't just going suck it out of the ground for a year and say we are done.    It also takes a long time for water to naturally return to the aquifer if it doesn't get transported 500+miles to another location.    I  think you need to educate yourself before going full retard.

Anyone know of a specific place you can research this issue? Apparently dramatic comments for karma is more important than facts! Cool! 
Better stop using paper too..Michigan's 49 paper mills use 500 times more water than Nestlee


Every single beverage you consume is produced with public water. Every soda, every beer etc. Singling out Nestle is the most retarded thing ever.

Edit: Jesus Christ this thread is heavily astroturfed.
You can get water straight from the source too at a discount. 

The expensive part of water is piping it down to your house, that costs  money to maintain. Water bottling companies are getting that water at a discount because they pay for a dedicated line and they handle the logistics.
The public pays a municipal source to process it and then pipe it to their home or business. Most of the cost per gallon of that goes towards maintaining the infrastructure rather than for the water itself. That municipal source is probably buying the water at a similar rate to what Nestle is. Nestle isn't exactly hooking into a residential tap.
Money is fun to have. That's pretty much all there is to it, grease the right palms and you can literally get away with anything. 
They have been buying politicians for a long time. 
> if the government can't handle the water safely, maybe

Voters should vote for people who actually can. Don't just blame "the government" as if it was some static homogeneous entity. Its the voter who elects people to the government, and those elected officials shape the government. For good or bad.

Michigan has no water shortage of any kind. They are surrounded by lakes of fresh water. A problem some of Michigan does have is with their pipes. Nestl√© buying water from the source does not effect Michigan's water situation in any meaningful way. 
yeah, god forbid someone brings jobs to Michigan, gets paid for fair and unimpactful resource usage, and provides a good that is badly needed at the moment
the people paid for a new system for nestle, thinking it was for them. but no. the old system is where their water comes from, nestle gets the new system's water. sort of why people say don't buy bottled, it leads to privatization of our water supplies ... which always (yeah, i'll say always) leads to stuff just like this. 
Because that would be the Government.  
Yes. The end result is that the government will end up spending less money on bottled water than they would have otherwise. The residents get water, and it costs the government less so they have more money to spend fixing the problem. That's how the free market works.
Why do you think it's barren in the first place? 
Well eventually they'll overdraw the aquifer since I'm guessing it probably refills at a much lower rate (if at all) than they're draining.  Depending on their resources at that point, their stocks might lower.  I'd love to see if they've carried out surveys of this reservoir and what the data from those surveys show.
>Then sell it for $1 for a little tiny ass bottle.

They are not selling the water bottle for $1. You can buy a whole pack of them at any grocery store for about 20 cents each, about the cost of manufacturing a plastic bottle. When you pay $1 you are overwhelmingly paying for the salary of the worker who delivered it to your location.
The media isn't making it any better. A person first needs to want to see if his opinion isn't being misled. Otherwise he just consumes what's being offered. And often times what's offered is shit.
Any brewery or soft drink takes more water to produce a liter of their product than Nestle. Calling Nestle the worst is just ridiculous. Also you mostly pay for the wage of the guy in the grocery store, for the trucker delivering it to the grocery store and for the shelf space there. You aren't paying for water but you are paying for water in a bottle close to your home. Don't like that service? then don't use it.
They would do it if they found a way to profit on it. 
They have ploughed on through [much worse scandals](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6) and just not given a crap about the negative publicity. There was a boycott and they just shrugged it off with almost no change in tactics.
The profits outweigh the cost of fines. They already have been killing babies for years. 
Not just chocolate and water. They are one of the big six multnationals that own 95% of the major brands in the US and around the world.

Charge them for each glass of water they want after about 24 hours. Charge them enough to make it hurt every time they look at the price for it.
From a piece written by the same man in 2008

> Water is still treated as a limitless resource in too many communities, and one reason is that it is has no price. States heavily subsidize water usage so that it is sometimes even free for both farmers and consumers. Because it is not assigned a value in the marketplace, there is no incentive for using it efficiently.

And from another piece

> Water‚Äîby far the most valuable resource on this planet‚Äîis treated as if did not have any value at all. We often do not even know the cost of providing it; the true number is buried under open and hidden subsidies, taxes, and the sunk costs of municipal and regional water and irrigation departments. This is particularly true for water used in agriculture. The problem is not that farmers use water; the problem is that they very frequently use it inefficiently. We see sprinklers turning at noon, unlined irrigation canals where water is seeping away faster than it actually flows, and a lack of both interest and incentives to invest in drip irrigation. Water, too often, has no price. It is seen and treated as a free good, or the price for farmers is far below what others have to pay.

And just one last one

> Answers to the problem could include setting a price on water, under certain conditions, so ‚Äúit is being used in a more responsible manner,‚Äù along with better irrigation methods, smarter government policies, and creation of water exchanges to regulate its sale and transfer.
> 
> that corp is evil to the core.

It is.  It's the largest food corp in the world and they fucking own everything.
These are the same people who gave a bunch of "free" infant formula to hospitals in Africa so that the mom's milk supply would be insufficient and they'd have no choice but to buy fucking formula for the next year of their kid's life. Keep in mind that not only do these people not* have money for that shit (it's fucking expensive), but they also don't always have access to clean water to prepare it with. 

People need to stop calling breastmilk liquid gold because that makes breastfeeding sound unattainable. It is not liquid gold, IT'S FREE. Formula, on the other hand? Take a walk down the baby aisle of a supermarket. There's a reason they keep that shit locked up.

Yes, but in places like Flint, Michigan, the government was so incompetent that the public water system corroded and now delivers tasty lead-poisoned water.
We have tap water. Only in a lot of places here the tap water isn't safe to drink. The water from the tab in Flint, Michigan is dark green. Nestle is trying to take their water reservoirs to worsen the problem and sell the same water back to them for more. 
I'm from Michigan. It was more of a tongue and cheek joke. But I do believe the resources can be better used. Nestle is a horrible company with a long record of abusing natural resources. I sincerely hope as a fellow Michigander you recognize that Nestle more than doubling their intake of water from the water table is not a particularly good thing. 

I just did a little research and Denmark bottle water industry is one of the fastest growing. From nearly 3% market share to 18% market share within 5 years. 

People like it because it's convenient. Some don't like the taste of their tap or cite health reasons, but that's pretty irrelevant in 99% of the United States. It's easy to grab, has the appearance of cleaner water, and is cheap. 
Some people say they don't trust tap water (even though these same people cook with it, give it to their pets, etc) or they prefer the taste of bottled water.

Tap water seems fine to me, and I don't have to waste lots of plastic bottles by drinking it. 
Location also matters, the difference between Oregon and Arizona public water is night and day.
The other thing people ignore is efficiency.

Bottled water/beverages are almost entirely used for drinking. The stuff is expensive so it rarely goes to waste.

If Nestle buys 576,000 gallons of water per day that means Nestle's customers are drinking very close to 576,000 gallons of water per day. There is very little waste when it comes to the water part in a bottled beverage.

Municipal tap water is mostly used for purposes other than human consumption. The vast majority is used for laundry, bathing, watering lawns, and other things that don't involve people drinking it.

I use fraction to highlight how small Nestle's usage of water is. Not trying to be mathematically accurate. 
What I said about the water industry is accurate. What I said about Nestle is also accurate. 

Will they limit their pull to 400gpm or whatever they asked for?  Your goddamn right they will. Water access is HEAVILY regulated**. They'll have to update their permit if they want to pull more. 

**I assume that the state they are operating in operates similarly to KY.  I will say that every state I've worked in has some regulatory body that governs access to and production of treated water. 
Then they shouldn't sell water then
That's enough for 800 people to have 64 ounces each, every minute or...the people of Flint would have their daily water supply (all 99,700 of them) in a little over two hours


Hear me out. Consumer boycotts aren't an effective means to combat this behaviour. Why you might ask? Because we've known about this bullshit for a long time, and Nestle is doing *just fucking fine*. The cost of acquiring information on brands who are behaving badly is too high when we use dozens upon dozens of brands on a day to day basis. The average consumer simply doesn't have time for it, as evidenced by the fact that most of us aren't doing it.

This is why the government is the one who needs to be responsible for controlling corporations who are acting like shitbags like this. Individual boycotts won't do shit, if you really want to do something active looking into what arm of the government is responsible for controlling these shitheads and writing letters/calling them is going to be far more impactful.
He forgets the company that owns all of them
Indeed. Well water is almost free. Its not entirely free because your well needs maintenance. Things break and filters need to be replaced which costs money. But at its core its just a hole in the ground that fills with water. Drink as much as you like.
Yeah I have worked with water utilities in large cities before - in a location like Michigan - a state that's literally surrounded by some of the most plentiful freshwater on the planet - the cost of pumping and treating the water is almost negligible compared to the cost of maintaining the distribution systems. 
[removed]
Except houses are not billed by how far their house is from the water tank.

Why does the corporation get to pay less due to less government owned piping, but the normal resident does not get the same discount?
im always curious about this. my company produces trenchless pipe rehab equipment. Uv cure liner that essentially is a brand new pipe inside of the existing one. a good crew and install about 800' a day from start to finish. it's relatively inexpensive, lasts 100 years...we've heard nothing about a project up there. seems like a no brainer. 
So, why isn't the headline, "Government Auctions Off Even More Water To Nestle", or something along those lines?
It seems the seller is the one doing the most harm.
it's still kind of silly though, when you have one of the greatest water sources on the planet nearby, that you'd pay middlemen instead of skipping the middle man and going straight to the source

What is going on in the world? I don'n't even know how to process this.

Well aware. But don't you think they're being closed in upon? Because that's my sense.
Thanks for the link, stranger! :) Dear GOD! That's shocking! :'( 
because, obviously detroit & flint are having way too much potable water ? So much that nestle needs to take it all away >.>
It's got what plants crave?
noitsnot.jpg
I thought that's what they want us to do, treat it like a commodity so they can secure it through the courts, we don't want that.
how about at a rate that compares to the amount of profit they make per bottle? 3.71 Cdn per 1 000 000 litres of water? and a bottle costs the public 3.50?  so that glass of water is gonna cost you around 1 500 000 dollars. too bad it's still probably chump change to them.
They probably drink some really expensive bottled water and don't even bat an eyelid at the cost.
I don't disagree with the problem and if I trusted his intent, his solution would make sense too.... but I don't.  Water would be used more efficiently if there were more associated costs to it but he seems very anxious to just profit off that.
I made a point to look up exactly what they own. 

For the most part, I've stopped giving them my business. Got a reusable water bottle. Switched my pets foods. Said a sad goodbye to Hot Pockets. It wasn't helping me lose weight anyway, in the long run, so I'm learning to like vegetables instead. 

Fuck Nestl√©. 
speaking of edgy...

> What is it like knowing that you're so stupid that you're perfectly willing to talk about things you know nothing about? I'm honestly curious since I haven't acted that way since I was a child.

You're not wrong. But you're being a dick about it. This entire portion is unnecessary. 
You don't need to be bribed to be willing to sell your states', or your country's, water. Where do you think all these bottled water companies get their water from? The moon? Why are you so quick to shift blame to just one target? If you don't want to see water sold, then make it legally forbidden in some way. 
Does the fault lie with the one who offers the bribe or the one who takes it? I would say in this case it would be the one who takes it since they would be held to a slightly higher standard than the one offering here. 
Our forest coverage has been growing for decades now. 
Expensive bottled water is used almost exclusively for human consumption, and is wasted far less than municipality provided tap water.

Water is an essentially infinite resource. When it flushes, it evaporates back into the atmosphere, then rains back down. Water doesn't disappear. 
The capitalists as well
It's already been shown that they were. 
Muchmore money, please!
It's like a lazily written cartoon.
Oh wow, that's terrible!
But that has nothing to do with Nestle or Coke or Budweiser.
Could we narrow down "a lot of places".  I've heard that Flint is a major screwup so, while this indicates that screwups like this are possible, the level of reporting suggests it's not all that common.  (I'm asking as a non-American.)
[deleted]
I do understand that. Just making a point that the state as a whole doesn't struggle for water. You're aware of that though. 
I have to admit I still buy bottled water, and that's for the same reason as mentioned.

When you buy a pack of 12 bottles and put them in your fridge it's super easy to take with you/ drink if you want something cold without having to find a bottle and fill it at the sink. 
> Some people say they don't trust tap water

Ironically, they seem to trust the plastic that those bottles are made of. Because that actually does contaminate the water inside.
Oh, something important to add is the fact that where I live we have our own ground water supply.
While I would intuitively agree with you, do you have a source for the assertion that people don't waste bottled water?
Yeah thats the problem of the future, water waste is huge and eventually fresh water will be a problem we have to deal with.  Drinking water from Nestle, that also creates jobs isn't going to kill our water supply lol.
Yes, I understand that. That's why I'm asking why we use it to mean "small".
Flint does not have a water scarcity problem, they have a water distribution problem. Saving their water is not going to make the problem any better for them.
It's pretty hard to boycott Nestle unless you make your own food from scratch or avoid specific foods.
> Consumer boycotts aren't an effective means to combat this behaviour

> [...] most of us aren't doing it.

So it is effective, there just isn't a lot of us doing it.
PepsiCo? Coca Cola?
I tend to agree, but I work in the pipeline rehab industry. I don't think we even know what maintenance actually costs because no one really does it outside of point repairs. we've all been kicking that can down the road for a long time. and everything is reaching the end of it's design life at once. we literally cannot produce equipment fast enough for inspection and trenchless repair.
Looks like Nestle is using groundwater, i.e. digging wells. You can also dig a well for water, then you don't have to pay anyone anything. Nestle has to pay because of the volume they're taking.
guarantee someone's going to find some way that that sort of price discrimination (distance from the plant) can be classified as racist
Maybe make some phone calls and see if you can advance your career. 
Because they control the media. 

EDIT- To clarify I meant mainstream media. 

What's the rate the aquifer is being refilled at?
"stole" legaly with a permit..     
Yes it was expired but the rules for the permit as granted by the USFS allow them to keep using it as long as they had applied to renew (they did) and kept paying the fee (they did)    
If you want to be mad go yell at the Forest service for letting the renewal application sit for 20+ years.    
BTW that 1200% includes the cost of building and maintaining their own pipe system to bring it to a road, trucking it several miles to a plant 8000 gallons at a time, then bottling it.    
All these things add costs.


ass did any other food company that bottles anything in California. Which is all of them. Which all use way less water than farming which gets exported from California. But go ahead and celebrate your ignorance.
gosh - it's almost as if having the world run by a bunch of giant profit making corporations is not such a good idea after all - who'd have thought?
What would you be willing to do to stop them? 
They have more than enough water they just have a shitty infrastructure. You can't blame Nestle for their shittly lead pipes.
You will be what plants crave.

$3.49 for a case of 24 16.9 ounce bottles of water. A little under $0.18/bottle. And this is from Staples, meaning they are middle men for Nestl√© and thus they are profiting probably somewhere in the middle between this price and cost price.

http://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21632569-price-making-plastic-bottle

The price to make a bottle in the US is estimated to be around $0.02/bottle. Water is a tenth of a cent per bottle so practically free.

Distribution costs are decent, water is heavy, I'm gonna randomly guess it's not more than the cost of the bottle as say $0.01/bottle. 

So Nestl√© probably makes $0.07-0.08/bottle.
Their drink of choice is a bit saltier. Specifically, the tears of orphaned puppies.
he thinks it should have a price, one he pockets rather than the community or government.
Exactly. I doubt the CEO would have the same viewpoint if municipalities raised the price of water for this reason, but instead used the profits toward schools and making the community better.
> For the most part, I've stopped giving them my business.

I did that when I discovered that at the very least they were knowingly profiting from child slavery.

And yeah, they own everything.
If everyone did this they wouldn't exist.  I haven't bought anything Nestle in 10+ years.  

Criminals.  Evil people.  


People should start sabotaging their facilities and protesting and harrassing employees.  

I think if anything, water is worth rioting over. 
Well it's a fact that he never said it. so I fail to see how pointing out the truth is edgy. 

> If you don't want to see water sold, then make it legally forbidden in some way.

Good luck with that. Bottled water is a ridiculously huge industry that in a more limited sense is necessary because not everyone everywhere has access to clean water.

It needs to be controlled, not forbidden. And as someone who grew up in a Wisconsin city right on the lake, you bet like hell I'm gonna do what I can to protect it. And I like to think locally (at least in Wisconsin) others agree.
The bribes certainly help
[deleted]
[deleted]
So cut em all then, what's the harm. 
We should jack the rates on it so high that the industry has an incentive to reuse and reduce, in my opinion 
Because we stopped cutting them down and started planting! National Park and blm stopped our forests from disappearing 

Indonesias rainforests are never coming back. That ecosystem is dead. 
We don't have any cranberries in Massachusetts this year because there's no water
It wasn't actually the government at the heart of it, but some incompetent company. That is now actually doing the same thing to Pittsburgh.

I never said it did. A question was asked, by what I assume is a non-American, so I gave him an answer. 
Eh. Nestle's been actively advertising and lobbying against tap water for roughly 50 years now, at an international level. Even if they're not responsible for this specific incident, they deserve a fair share of the blame for the general state of our water infrastructure that allows these things to happen. 

Normally any indictment that vague I'd think was a bit extreme, but honestly Nestle is just that evil. They've literally killed babies for money. Fuck em.
Not a lot of places. Few places. Flint is a major example. I live in michigan, where flint is, and it is not like that elsewhere. Flint took itself off of Detroit's water a while back. Detroit water, which supplies the majority of water in the area, is a very clean source of water.
[removed]
There are major cities where the water quality is as bad or worse than Flint's, but no one has reported on it yet. 
Cool, cheers!
https://plasticsinfo.org/Functional-Nav/FAQs/Beverage-Bottles

I would love to see your sources of plastic water bottles contaminating the water inside. 
Would you use bottled water to take a shit? It's beyond intuitive that people would use bottled water for drinking at a higher rate than they use the water from their municipality because you're paying many times more for bottled water. Unless there's someone out there buying truckloads of bottled water and emptying it back into lake Michigan I cannot see a way around the logic of the comment above you's claim about higher efficiency. 

Of course this whole thing ignores the more obvious negative impacts of bottled water use (mainly plastic waste and potential water rights issues in areas without readily available fresh water) and tap water use (eventual ground and surface water pollution, potential contamination of drinking water, municipal/Ag. water rights challenges, etc) but technically if your only metric for people using water efficiently is that they use all that they have just for drinking water then bottling must be the better process.
Usually people use a modifier like 'a tiny fraction'. 
I don't know. I suppose there are better ways to accurately indicate a small amount. 
Because synonyms exist. I don't know what else to tell you. 
Not saying save it. I propose a above ground temporary system until the below ground pipes are fixed.

When the military goes to the middle east I'm pretty sure there are no pre-existing water lines in the desert so they had to have some kind of temporary system to get water to the soldiers in the camp. Granted, 100k people is a bit different than  a thousand or so but the principles could still work.
They're mostly about processed food. I went through their list of brands and the only one I recall buying in the past year was Allens sweets.
Here's a list of 3000 brands to avoid (most of them not sold in your country, have fun sorting), that's an effective way way to take down the evil corporation!

I really don't understand why people actually believe themselves when they say that.
Something can be ineffective because it's impractical. On the flipside, there are many successful stories where the government has regulated and stopped abusive industry practices.

Worth considering.
And could we please stop targeting one company and one company only? How do you think water gets into Coke or into beer? Producing one liter beer takes way more water than producing one liter bottled water.
trust me the thought has crossed my mind. But unfortunately, like most employees these days I can't afford the equipment I design and manufacture. a new turn key UV install truck starts at about 750k and goes upward of 1.5M. not including pumps, winches, PPE confined space gear...etc. It's a gold mine if you can pony up the startup cash, but there in lies the problem.

Except if we control it for Nestle, we have to control it the same way for farmers/brewers/etc because of NAFTA. So if you want to screw over Nestle, you have to screw over some of the most important industries at the same time.
> is necessary because not everyone everywhere has access to clean water.

Or bottled water is used as an excuse to let water quality go to shit.

The stuff should be taxed to hell anywhere that has a drinkable supply.
Why assume bribes? This is just capitalism. Bribes don't happen in 99% of resource sales, why would they just happen here? Water is just another thing to sell. If air was able to be sold, do you think it wouldn't be? 
Bribery is money given to persuade someone to do something illegally. The government officials are able to make those decisions and are not personally being paid; that makes it a purchase, not a bribe. Purchases can be ill-advised without putting rhetorical terms behind them.
What bribes? How the fuck do you think any company gets water? Like Coke or Pepsi or any brewery? Like any industrial plant?
People seem to forget that it's not all that illegal for a company to offer money to a politician but it is definitely illegal for that politician to take it in exchange for goods or services or just to take it period in many cases but yet they still keep electing these same asshats that fuck them over. 
Because it's actually something that in practicality is replenishable, contrary to the above commenter's assertion
Water isn't treated as a scarce commodity. That's why it gets overused and wasted in regions prone to shortages.
Well guess what... this article is about a state literally surrounded with fresh water. Not massachusetts. Just because water isn't in one area doesn't mean it is gone. 
And just how did this company get into that position? Incompetence by the government. The government gets no absolution from this by passing the buck to a contractor.
What a load of horseshit. Trying to blame one company for shitty infrastructure in states that underwent a harsh economic downturn in the last 30 years is laughable. And no they haven't killed babies for profit. You could argue that some of their action lead indirectly to the death of infants in 3rd world countries in the 70s but that's it. And that was as much of a problem of governance and public healthcare there as it was one of Nestle. But they are not anywhere near the level of united fruit for example that literally caused a war because they couldn't keep their debt slaves on their plantations. Calling it "killing babies for profit" is just propaganda and nothing more.
That's hyperbole.  It is not common that low income areas have undrinkable water.  It is the case in some places which is a travesty, but the vast majority of low income areas of the US have perfectly drinkable water.
In the US? I've heard 2 reports this year. You make it sound like it's across the board.
Yes. Again, this is my point. A fraction can be big or small. Why do we use it for just small?

For instance, I'm the only person sitting at my desk. That's 1/1. A fraction of people sitting at my desk are me.
I really enjoy when people proclaim they are going to boycott food companies, I.E. Tyson without realizing they own the majority of the supply.

You can't purchase meat anywhere in America without it being related to Tyson or another major meat supplier. Restaurants, grocery stores, fast food joints....unless you own your food supply it's almost impossible to avoid major food companies. They even own ingredients in other pre-packaged foods, I.E. meat in frozen pizza.
Or any major industrial facility, many of which use 10 times that amount of water. I mean, I get it, Nestle is the devil, but they're like the Walmart of water; no worse than any of the other similar companies, people just hate on them more.
Could you give me a link to a paper or other source that states the number?
They also kill babies you know.  
After laying there for a while... you know after he stops breathing.
Too be fair, those children are probably completely dehydrated from all of their earlier crying, making the sweet tears much more expensive to produce
For better or worse the quote is (paraphrased) "The two options for water management are, one, which I find extreme, to declare it a right. That is, that you have a right of access to water. The other is to treat it like any other foodstuff and give it a market value so that we all realize that it does have a price." I already closed the YouTube video or I'd post a link, crucify me if you need to.
>Would you mind providing the quote in context that they are misrepresenting? 

The quote in context was that while drinking water is right, other usages aren't. 

For example, why should it be a right of the individuals living near the sources to use it for watering lawns, or growing crops, or the thousand other things it's used for? That's not what we do for any other natural resources. 

If a given amount of water provides more value bottled and sold than used for agriculture/lawns or any of the other ways it's used, then why claim it is the right of the individuals living at that location to use it for free for those purposes that provided less utility?  

This was made very clear in the interview that quote was taken out of. 
I don't think that's necessarily true. You have to put controls in for large users that do not return water to it's original water shed. Farmers and smaller local businesses wouldn't be harmed in that case, they mainly returning water back to the original water shed.

It's companies that ship the water or the products containing water out of the water shed in large quantities that is an issue. A smaller brewery wouldn't be hurt buy this, they aren't shipping it out in mass. A larger one though would be. But if they are large and using a lot of water, they pose the same threat as Nestle, even if they aren't necessarily viewed as the "evil guys" like Nestle is in this thread.
Pretty sure water quality is a city or municipality controlled thing. And thus unless the water companies are bribing indiviudal city officials at the small local level, water quality is probably not going to shit.

I don't think I've ever heard anyone go "Eh, let's just stop filtering the water as good and make them buy bottled." Even in Flint, it was a decision made to switch the source for other reasons. Not just because they were lazy. Generally if an area doesn't have clean water, I'm sure there is some reason other than "Fuck the towns people! Make them buy bottled!"
> Bribery is money given to persuade someone to do something illegally.

What?  If you have 10 people making a decision for product A or product B.  if the company for product A gives those 10 people $100 bill before making a decision to totally not influence them, how is that not a bribe?
If you pay a politician to write a law, it's not technically bribery 

It's in the spirit of bribery anyway 
They lobby for preferential pricing and give campaign contributions to ensure they're written into law, just like every other industry 
No expert, but it depends on what you are talking about. Old growth trees won't be replenished anytime soon. The little that I know says that new growth, and old growth trees contribute differently to ecosystem. There is much chaffing between federal regulators and people who want to cut down trees. Some say the government is too restrictive, some say not enough. I know I honestly don't know enough to say.
Replenishable and infinite are different things. That's why we have different words for them
Water conservation was drilled into me since kindergarten. I don't know why no one ever told me that what we use is almost literally a drop in the bucket. 

It's all industry here and agricultural to the south and west. 

We're approaching it all wrong is what I mean 
Water is finite 

You're describing a closed system, which isn't what our changing climate is.

The Sahara used to be jungle. And now it's desert because water is finite
They continued that practice into the 90's, even after being reprimanded by WHO. You can't claim it was indirect or accidental after 20 years. They knew what they were doing.

And I'm not saying they were directly responsible for this water crisis.  But they've done a real number to water infrastructure. We'd definitely be better able to deal with water problems if Nestle wasn't always messing shit up.
It's hyperbole, but the origin of the hyperbole actually goes back to the bottled water industry, interestingly enough. [They spent a lot of money trying to discredit tap water in order to incentivize people to buy bottled water.](https://youtu.be/Se12y9hSOM0?t=2m59s) 
And the word "sinister" literally means left handed. We don't use it in that way though. You can apply your logic to countless examples in the English language. The fact is that not every word is always used in relation to its strict dictionary definition.

>Our planet is not running out of water, nor is it losing water. There's about 360 quintillion gallons of water on the planet, and it's not going anywhere except in a circle. Earth's hydrologic cycle is a closed system, and the process is as old as time: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and so on.

I dont know how you think water works. 


EDIT: I'll add in the hydrologic cycle for you, so you can see why we're not losing water. Water levels remain the same. Just because water ends up somewhere else doesn't mean it is gone. 

http://water.usgs.gov/edu/graphics/watercyclesummary.jpg
Sinister's definition made sense at the time. The left hand was the "wrong" hand.

My question is why did we start using "a fraction of" to mean small? Do you have an answer? Because all I'm getting here and from searching is "We don't know. Just accept it."
I'm not going to believe you if you can't back up your claim then.
Our planet isn't going to run out of water, but Michigan might. The water was deposited there, and if the climate changes the water will go somewhere else. Maybe the ocean 

Just like we'll still have trees if we cut down every forest in the country  
I'm just trying to say that definitions and word usage changes over time and it is not always logical why. "Fractional" used in this way is just one of many examples of this. 

So as annoying as it may seem "it's just the way it is" is really the only answer to your question. 
All of needs less description.       
Some of is vague. Fraction helps clear up.
If you can show me any evidence that the lakes are losing volume, i'll accept that claim. 
Darn it. I guess I'll just have to deal with it. Thanks for the help. I do appreciate it.
With the lowering of the water table in this region the people of this valley are in the right to protest.  Climate change is causing drastic changes in precipitation, this area has already been hit pretty hard.  A business of any kind that needs so much water should not be started in this location.
Constellation Brands beers include: Corona, Modelo, Ballast Point, Pacifico, Funky Buddha, Tocayo and Victoria.

[Apparently](http://science.time.com/2013/09/04/millercoors-gets-more-beer-to-the-barrel-with-water-efficiency/) it takes about 4 units of water to make a unit of beer. And [Sonora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora#Agriculture_and_livestock) is already growing a lot of water-intensive crops. I don't think the brewery is the right thing to be protesting.
Mostly piss water beers. I can definitely live without those. Ballast is the only craft choice I drink on there and have no problem dropping them.
It sounds like the people protesting are not the people who sold the land/water rights to the brewery. 

Protest whoever sold it and not the people who bought it. 
Welcome to the western world where property and resource rights belong to whoever can make the most money from it.

Did Mexicans never us it in the first place? I mean their tap water is undrinkable. 

Would it be okay if it was a Mexican owned brewery or water bottle plant?
So Mexican's don't like a US presence consuming a large quantity of the water in a drought prone area?

Hmmmm.

Given the water being syphoned off the Colorado for consumption on Southern California, how about a compromise?
I support the Mexicali farmers and the sleazeball governor backing the corporation can go fuck himself. 
Yo, we got a wall that needs paying for. Como esta deal, por favor?
[Also, some aquifers don't recover once depleted.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140819-groundwater-california-drought-aquifers-hidden-crisis/)
I can live without all those. Too bad, because Modelo is a pretty choice brew.

There are too many craft options to be pulling stuff like this, though...
nah, i like Modelo.
Foreign companies give less of a shit about destroying the local environment, see Coca Cola in India
>Many are seething at the idea that precious water rights are being handed over to gringos.

What matters is their water rights are being stolen. If it was a Canadian company it would say "Canadian-owned."  

It would be one thing if they were being fairly compensated. And in a situation where your forcing something away from people, fairly compensated should mean a multiple of the value and potential future value to the people that currently have the water rights. If you tried to take a resource away from a corporation you can damn sure bet that's the amount they would be suing for. 

But this looks like it's happening because the farmers are powerless to stop a company from just taken their water for free.  
So edgy.
Whataboutism isn't good for anyone. 
When that actually happens.
You can‚Äôt get welfare without paying taxes, which would mean they are contributing just as much as anyone else that uses it, citizen or otherwise.
I presume the locals were using it... and to answer your second question, probably not.
Colorado River last time I checked didnt flow backwards
Yea.  We can compromise by telling Nestle they can get the fuck out of America with their water operations.
Or dont lease the land and water rights...
Are you trying to imply that Mexican migrant workers are the reason Southern California Farms consume way too much water for their geographical area?
The only one I would miss is Modelo
or Union Carbide (DOW) in Bhopal, India
Or, look at Nestle.
I do wonder whether economic impact it would have if the Mexican town had all American companies leave. I bet the town would dry up and go away just like the many American towns this has happened to in the past. 
How is it being stolen?
It‚Äôs not edgy it‚Äôs true. Nestle gets to have fresh water while California is in drought, Michigan gives corporate handouts while ignoring flint, and this brewery gets to use up a bunch of water in a historically dry area. It‚Äôs an emphasis on corporate profit over stakeholder welfare. 
[deleted]
You're really smart
Not true at all. My aunt works at the benefits place where im at. How you gonna pay taxes if you cant work?
after the CEO said that water is not a human right and the corporation deserves it more than people. they should all be arrested and held for crimes against humanity.
we can do that too, along with other things
So I actually asked some of the people in my community who are knowledgeable about agriculture and asked *why* the hell are crops grown in a desert.  Its because of how much longer their growing season is.  In California you can have TWO growing seasons whereas in Nebraska you get one (maybe 1.5 for certain crops but it is very hit or miss with how the weather can be).  I still think it is a bad idea long term but it makes a bit more sense.  And as for migrant workers: they're the only ones willing to do the shit labor of harvesting crops, without them we have food rotting in the fields.   I personally cannot blame them in any way for this situation as they just follow where the work is.
no i'm not

i'm suggesting people here illegally (of which there is a large population in SoCal) consume natural resources, in the case of fresh water its a resource we have a shortage of
Mexicans are the reason the Southern Californian metropolis consumes too much water for its geographical area.
Or Shell in Nigeria
Nestle might be US based, but their black cold hearts are international.
The article says the farmers have had the water rights since the 1940's but the government is going to let the beer companies take the water. 
You still haven't proven your claim. Just some wild, racist assertion.
Thank you
If you have no job and need welfare assistance then you need to be documented to receive it. You can‚Äôt just walk in there and ask for money. 
Exactly, that was my point. The only reason migrant workers are there is because there are job opportunities in the first place. The reason for the drought is people chasing profit at the cost of environmental stability. I mean seriously, one of the most popular crops grown are almonds, which require an entire gallon of water per nut. That‚Äôs insane
Probably better to blame industrial farming as they consume [80% of the water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/04/03/agriculture-is-80-percent-of-water-use-in-california-why-arent-farmers-being-forced-to-cut-back/?utm_term=.3005504dc934). Meanwhile, only 6% of the population is undocumented, which, all other things being equal, means they are only consuming. 1.2% of the states water supply. 
That‚Äôs a very interesting* take you have there. My understanding is that it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs a fucking desert with a large population of human beings combined with a focus on farming the most lucrative crops rather than crops that would be more environmentally appropriate that consumed all of the water. But your probably right, it‚Äôs just the undocumented 6% over their population that‚Äôs putting them over. 

*Read: racist
Or Volkswagen in the US
Nestle is Swiss. Headquarters are in Switzerland. 
So the government changed the rules. Shit happens.
There is only one source that estimates and records such cost and its FAIR, a (R) partisan group.

It's like linking Shareblue or Correct the Record, because it's a non-government special interest group (lobbyist).

Here you go though;
https://howmuch.net/articles/state-by-state-costs-of-illegal-inmigration

Now that is out of the way.  Why wouldn't the government services provided to illegal aliens and their children, tax evasion provided to corporations that hire them and themselves not cost the US a substantial amount of money?
That's not entirely true.
the last 1.2% that should be consumed

there's really no way to justify people that shouldn't be here consuming something we're short of
the 6% contribute to the problem

nothing racist about it, legal folks of the same national origin are not being singled out.  stop race baiting, this is about being legal v. illegal.
Try 50% bub. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Los_Angeles
Rule law, property rights who cares about those. 

Even in America it's all fun and games until you don't pay your property taxes or an NFL team wants to build a stadium on your house.
Hmm well according to [benefits page](https://www.usa.gov/benefits#item-36602) on the governments website, one of the only federally listed rules is to be a resident of the state. So it would seem to be entirely true. Also, for my state, [Minnesota ](https://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/1666), to receive benefits you have to be a citizen or a qualified non citizen (
They said Mexicans are the reason for over consumption. They only contribute to 6% of consumption (everything else being equal). Blaming a minority for the faults of everyone is racist scapegoating. 
liberals have no other argument, they always pull race card.

Hey nice cherry picked stat. That‚Äôs 50% Hispanic or Latino (wether documented or not) for los Angeles. Only 6% of the population is undocumented. Also the reason the population of Hispanics is so high is because it was literally a Mexican territory prior to joining the us. Additionally, that 44% that is documented is not Mexican. Because they live in the United States, you moron. 
Or the bureau of land management wants to start charging for land your family has grazed cattle on for years.
Parents can collect for children.
I don't agree with how that post was worded either....but...I don't agree with your conclusion either.  If he 6% shouldn't be consumed and it is, its illegals that are the last folks that should be contributing to the problem.
In the case of the Bundy's, that was leased land, not owned. And they  decided they shouldn't have to pay the lease and didn't. Pretty big difference but still a shity situation.
Dude what are you even arguing anymore? This is hardly even tangentially related to the argument that undocumented immigrants are a burden on the welfare system.  
The Bundy family used it before the BLM.
I haven't presented any arguments besides mildly disagreeing with you.
FWIW, from the Wikipedia article on the standoff.

>The land to which Cliven Bundy claims ancestral rights was originally inhabited by the Moapa Paiute people.[8] In 1848, as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States purchased from Mexico land that is now the southwestern region of the United States. Since then, the government has continuously owned land in what is now Nevada, including the Bunkerville Allotment.
slavery, child labor, and stealing water...

I think I am going to switch to Hershey's.
While I totally agree that Nestle is a fucked company, and they are on the top of my boycott list; I must say that it is really weird and fishy that Mondelez International(another food company) is listed right at the top of the article as the 'Supporter' of the article...  

Does no one else see this as a massive conflict of interest?
It's not the stuff giant faceless multinational conglomerates admit to that should concern you - it's what they don't tell us.

  
Nestle is challenging Halliburton for the most evil company ever.
That's actually a good thing.

I mean, that they independently admitted it before someone else had to expose it. Not y'know, that it happened in the first place.

Still, it's a positive sign to see them being pro-active about the supply chain for once. I know it's probably because of all the heat they're getting, but they still actually did it instead of having yet another cover up. Frankly, I don't give a shit about the 'why' of it.
I was bummed to see they own Stouffer's.

Not that I *need* their Mac and beef or Enchiladas Suiza... sigh.
Hey guys,

Vote with your cash.

If you don't agree with Nestle's evil ways, don't purchase their goods - that's the only way they can continue to do this, through people purchasing their goods - if you purchase their products, but don't agree with their business you are directly supporting them, and reinforcing their behaviour through positive cash reinforcement to say: Yeah, keep being psychopaths and we'll keep rewarding you with profits. 

You can't expect them to change their behaviour while you continue to purchase their products - this is not how behaviours change, this is now how corporate culture changes. 
To be fair, everyone reading this thread on an iPhone is using a device built on the backs of poorly paid and highly overworked factory workers at the lovely foxxcon factory in China. The factory so nice they had to install special nets to prevent lots of people from killing themselves rather than continue to work for them. This is a lot of "hey, we looked into it and it turns out this company we contracted to for x is super freaking shady", which basically every consumer good sourced from poor Asian nations is tainted by. Its not even a question of "did they know", of course they knew. The knew how much they were paying them for a given amount of work/product, they knew the workers were either being paid very little to nothing and that it amounted to massive human rights abuse. You're also not going to find a company that does business in that part of the world that is excluded from these sorts of practices.
N E S T L √â S....Nestl√© slaves the very best
There was a consumer tv show in the Netherlands were a guy (Teun van de Keuken) made a case against himself, before a court and all, for willingly supporting slavery because he ate chocolate. He found out that 95% of chocolate was produced with slave labour at the time (2004) and no company could guarantee that their chocolate was 'slave free'. He was so shocked he decided to produce his own slave free chocolate, which is doing pretty well here in the Netherlands: http://www.tonyschocolonely.com/en/
We can expect a whole lot more of this when TPP/TTIP passes.  
Why is shit like this not a death sentence to a company? 
I feel like if you use slave labor, your entire net worth of your company should be stripped from you and given to the slaves.
Calm down Nestle, god damn. F'n chocolate Hitler over here.
Don't you just LOVE the corporations?
ITT: people who think Nestle secretly searched for children to make their slaves 
They independently made an investigation.  They proactively came out with the statement on their own and are making efforts to fix the situation.  Honestly we should applaud nestle for taking action against slave labor.  When a company as big as nestle is so diverse and spread out in its operations there will always be some sort of wrong doing some where.  I doubt they went in fully knowing what was going on behind the scenes.  Maybe if people actually read the whole article they could see both sides, but no lets grab the pitchforks and hop on the bandwagon.
Yup Boycotting Nestle Fuck them.
>‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve said consistently, forced labour and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain,‚Äù said Magdi Batato, Nestl√©‚Äôs executive vice-president in charge of operations, in a written statement. ‚ÄúNestl√© believes that by working with suppliers we can make a positive difference to the sourcing of ingredients.‚Äù

You know, when you hire a contractor to provide goods or services for your supply chain, you usually check them out. This is the most egregious bullshit I think a company can say. What I find disturbing is that Nestle was negligent in vetting their contractors to the point that *they probably didn't even take a look at the facilities*. No excuses, never buying Nestle again.
Nestle was probably tipped off that they were about to be exposed and did some preemptive damage control. Couldn't let they're greedy soulless reputation get any shittier . I aint buying it.
Nestle has always been terrible. They were knowingly responsible for untold numbers of [infant deaths in Africa](http://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6?op=1) in the 1970s.
"We're so against child slavery. That's why we get our cocoa in West Africa where it's totally known to happen."    
Got it, Nestle.
Yes, we DID do it over here - but over there we were good - the world really needs to cut us some slack. Have some delicious chocolate.
That company needs its assets seized and its operations halted.  All involved decision makers need to be indicted.  Give them 50 more years and they'll enslave us or withhold  water.
why is this shocking or even unknown to people the TPP is another way to exploit this form of slavery and indentured servitude.
Here's the thing, I'm willing to bet they knew about this from the get go. There was a threat that this information might become public, forcing them to "make a discovery." Given that the CEO doesn't think that water is a human right, I am almost certain they not only knew about this but probably orchestrated it. 
Reddit: Fear not


Reddit: The fine bros have lost 172k subscribers this week
I hate this company but they are the only supplier for my dad's feeding tube medication...:( they take and they give.
Nestle Asia is most likely a wholly different company from nestle Africa/Middle East. So I wouldn't be surprised that one corporate entity is doing something totally contrary to what the other corporate entity has done. At the same time, the issue here suggests either a lack of communication or total indifference and/or global hq not implementing effective policies. 
But let's keep talking about the finebros.
I can never look at an Oreo the same here in Alberta...
Given that Bill was shilling for Nestle and their contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative during his appearance on Colbert, I wonder just what extent Hillary has profited from these child labor practices.
Why do they keep fucking around? Is it really that important to earn a few more millions when you're running a multibillion dorrar intdustoeodris

Fucjking Nestl√© can suck my balls.
[deleted]
To be fair, there are worse things to do in Thailand
Title seems misleading, Nestle is exposing suppliers were using slavery without them knowing. A bit different than "admitting slavery" as if they've been doing it for a while.
first getting rid of the toys inside the wonderballs, and now THIS?!!
N e s t l e s,  Nestles slaves the very best.  
nestle is ALL KINDS of fuckedd up!
this is the most unsurprising thing i have read all day. it is an evil evil corporation and very difficult to avoid.

and for the kicker, the ceo firmly believes water should be a 100% privately controlled commodity   
Not their fault.  They are forced to.  I mean, look at the profits.  they have a responsibility to their shareholders.  
Hey Ancaps! Got an answer for this?
How the heck can that be a real title? That sounds so casual, "Admits to slavery...child labor," like, "Yeaaaaa, we used 'slavery' and 'child labor,' but those are just words."   
Like, were the victims too yellow and brown for it to matter? How are they allowed to be a company after all the shit that's been known and coming up this past decade and such?   
In general, it's baffling how practices like this by huge corporations are just so openly talked about and hardly stopped or fought against. 
Corporate America, the reason we are hated throughout the world.
Fuck you Nestle you make some of my favourite snacks and I don't eat them now, come back from the darkside you evil bastards
Slavery will always exist

Can anyone explain how this would work:

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl√©_brands 

> Rolo (except the United States, where Hershey makes it)
Why can't this get as much attention as The Fine Bros, or John Scott?
So how can we respond? I try my best to stay away from any products from corporations, and I try to either borrow/recycle/make my own stuff/buy local before buying from huge companies, but nestle makes so much stuff. What other actions can I take to show my dislike of nestle (and other crooks) if I can't escape buying their products?
The company I work for is a supplier to Nestle. Nestle came to our plant last year for an audit with the intention to determine if we treat our workers fairly, don't employ children, and don't have slave labor. Kind of ironic now. 
Nestl√© has been such a bad actor company for so long now. Back in the '70s they were selling powdered milk as a substitute for mother's milk, knowing full well how harmful it would be to the babies.
it's a bigger issue than just switching to a supplier that doesn't use child labor. 

These are the poorest of the poor, when the supplier stops using them, where will they go for their next meal? 
I am currently travelling through Central and South America. Nestle sells water for more than any soft drinks in many places. It is disgusting and dispicable. 
So we're gonna arrest the people running Nestle then, yeah?  I personally think all slavers need to be executed, but I'll settle for life in prison for every single person running Nestle.
ITT: people thinking that by not buying anything Nestle they'll end child labor once and for all.

Seriously, in some countries, people are so poor they bring on their kids for extra money. You can't blame a company for the poverty of the country that's supplying them. It's creating jobs, and the families need that money. In my home country some of my relatives have been working since age 10 because they can't pay rent. Does this mean you attack the company that hired them? No. Don't force your ideology on other cultures, it only makes matters worse.
Good on them to catch it and bring it up.  They aren't intentionally enslaving people.
welp. Fuck nestle, it's settled then. 
My surprise as always is people have to gind this out so late. Most companies down their supply chain are abusive. This is how USA stays wealthy. At the expense/exploitation of others. In addition, global citizens have been speaking about this for decades and is the base for anti US sentiment. Will we continue to listen finally? 


The serious issue at hand is that child labor is in many cases an alternative to child prostitution. When places cease child labor the rates of child prostitution skyrocket. Their civilization is built on children earning money, so to discontinue child labor without first addressing societal norms is the worse of two evils.
Buying Nestle stock next week. 

Love this company. Welcome to the real world, where news is purposely made inflammatory and your morals don't matter!

nothing will happen .. too big to fail, too to persecute

 
Treats made by slaves, I will feel like such royalty eating Nestle owned candy this year for Valentine's Day and Easter. 
I hate to be "that guy", but I tried boycotting Nestle once, and I gave up on it after only a short while. They make products I like, they make products other people like, and ultimately boycotting them is a pointless venture, unless like millions of people commit to it... which they won't. 

IMO, boycotting Nestle is just as fruitless as boycotting Foxconn. 
Nestle Slavery? where are the Activists where are your comments? Oh right they like to complain about Fictional slavery in Qatar and Dubai most comments here are joking so dont act like human right warriors anymore.
Completely different companies though. Hershey makes candies/chocolate bars, but Nestle makes a lot more stuff.

Capitalism is built upon the lowest class.

we need to move to a more firm socialist/capitalist hybrid already.
Hershey, Mars, etc. All the big chocolate companies get their chocolate from the Ivory Coast and all of them have slave labor in their supply chain. If you buy your chocolate from the candy aisle in an American supermarket, you are supporting slavery. Remember last Halloween? Yup. That's what you did. How could you be so irresponsible to support slavery like that when this isn't new information?
I'd rather go with a company that is aware of the problem and trying to do something.  The truth is that slavery in many areas goes uncontested because no one wants to find out they've been benefiting from slave labour
Any second now there will be indictments.  Any second...
[Hershey also uses child slavery.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/30/lawsuit-your-candy-bar-was-made-by-child-slaves.html)
If you actually read it, it was a company that they got their seafood products from that actually did the child labor and slavery. Nestle had no idea and actually stopped buying from them as soon as they found out.
Eh.. I don't care enough to switch from something that's yummy.
Check the boycott podcast by freakonomics, please. 
Wow, I read the article, but didn't notice that it was sponsored by their competitor.

I wish news organizations had some sense of integrity and would not publish these sponsored articles.
Nestle is evil and you should boycott them, says article paid for by Nestle competitor.
I agree with you, super fishy. But I'd be pissed too if my competitor was beating me useless with an army of child slaves too.
shut the fuck up, Leslie!
You must not buy a lot of things....

http://www.businessinsider.com/these-10-corporations-control-almost-everything-you-buy-2012-4
If I was following all the rules and not using slave labor and doing everything right, I'd be mad as hell that they don't have to do the same. I'd pay someone to investigate as well.

That being said, I don't know if that's the case, just seems like a possibility.
This is exactly the kind of thing John Oliver was talking about in his segment about 'Native Advertising'.
Nestle just copped to using child slaves. I'm having trouble thinking of something worse than that they could be hiding. They generate power by having orphans turn a wheel like the beginning of *Conan the Barbarian*? Their buildings are warmed entirely by kitten furnaces? Laffy Taffy is people?
Nestle, giving Umbrella Corp a run for it's money
Not to defend nestle but it seems the bigger issue here is the Thai seafood industry. The article is talking about a supplier of nestles. Chances are they are supplying MANY other compabies if they supply nestle. Most shrimp in the western market come from Thailand. Think about that next time you buy a pound of shrimp for $4. They are openly admitting that they have found an issue in their supply chain. That's not to say there aren't other issues with companies this big.
Let's not forget about P&G!
Not familiar with that company, can you elaborate? 
And Coca Cola
I know you are thinking positive. 

However, there is so much widespread corruption it is basically like nobody gives a fuck.

America doesn't care about slavery anymore, and it cares even less about where its goods are coming from.

Nike and many other companies still basically employ slave labor.

Weyerhaeuser and many other companies still hire Mexicans that don't speak English.

Nobody gives a fuck... they have done this for decades.

Child labor has been used since forever.

The only way to do anything about it is mass boycott but Americans are too pussy and too stupid to do it.
You take a much different view of this than I do.

My version is more them saying: "Slaves? yeah we use slaves, makes shit cheap! Hah, you want to sue us for it? Go fuck yourself"
>I mean, that they independently admitted it before someone else had to expose it.

Really? Because I recently read that it was exposed in 2011 and they admitted to it in 2014 and started their own internal investigation so they could stall the real one.

>Frankly, I don't give a shit about the 'why' of it.

Oh, never mind then...
No it was already exposed. They're not being proactive it's called textbook PR.
I'm currently wrestling with guilt over enjoying a cheap flavored water that Nestle puts out.  I dunno if I can be a good person and stop drinking them.
> Vote with your cash.
> 

That's the problem, most people go for cheap stuff. They are not willing to by ethical products because it costs more to treat ~~slaves~~ employees fairly.
It's a death sentence as far as I'm concerned.  I haven't bought Nestle all year.  It's not hard when I know their products are shitty, full of lead, using slave labor, stealing from drought-ridden California aquifers, etc.
Is that a band or something? 
Yeah they clearly broke into an elementary school, put leg irons on the kids, killed their parents, and put them to work in the fields. If they're not working for Nestle, what are they going to be doing? I understand the arm-chair sentiment, but the well-being of these children isn't going to be improved by simply punishing Nestle. These children aren't in an environment of prosperity.
An American company called Transocean caused the "BP" oil spill but it's BP that has to pay up because they are legally liable.  It should be the same for Nestle with any legal repucssions in this case.
I certainly don't agree with their practices, but Reddit sure has a hard-on for hating Nestle at every chance it gets.
[deleted]
Did not know this, thanks
Whole Foods is a Nestle wanna-be.  They're trying.
Buy more or donate to these countries so they can invest in necessary infrastructure.

Or you'll just create more child prostitutes.

What do you think these people are going to do with 0 foreign investment coming in?
That's what this article is about. It's about finding suppliers that are treating their employees unethically.  The exact audit you're talking about is a similar audit to what found the linked issues.
in the developing world, where their grip is almost absolute, ive repeatedly seen mothers feeding their babies on Nestles sweet and condensed milk. no public awareness to be seen.
Ya, their shit has been banned in my house since I've lived on my own. Am now married with child, their formula recently replaced lactose with glucose, and their shit is still banned from my house.
You're assuming all they can do is walk away from the situation and take their business elsewhere. Nestle is the biggest food company in the world, with a market capitalisation of around $247 Billion USD. 

Given that they have helped foster slave labour in the country, Nestle *could* try to play their part in fixing the problem at this point and start funding in Thailand to help reduce poverty. 

In a perfect world, that's what should happen - but as we've seen with Nike, I think they'll just take the path of waiting for this to all blow over. 
lol, do you think SLAVES can choose where to work ? Do you have any understanding of what SLAVERY is ? 
It's rarely a good outcome when a corporation alters a society's microeconomics. 
you know slavery isn't a job, right?
this isn't a new discovery - they have ABSOLUTELY been knowingly enslaving children!
Use the down vote button, and move on without shit posting. Bro. 
I haven't bought Nestle all year, since they got caught stealing water from California.  Then I heard about Maggi noodles full of LEAD.  Are you kidding?  It's easy to stop buying Nestle.  I'd be supporting a company that thinks it's OK to put lead in noodles.  Just because they haven't done it yet (*as far as we know*) in the U.S. doesn't mean they wouldn't.  We already know what their ethics are.  Buying Nestle = shitting where you eat.  I don't shit where I eat.
That's a bigass list of stuff. I'm gonna need an app that scans the barcode tells me the if it's nestle or not.
Yeah, Nestle is the largest of all food corporations.

Looks like mostly junk food. It seems I've already been boycotting them. 
But how do I avoid Ovaltine!?

true, but nestle is an evil abhorrent company with sociopathic leadership. You should seek out alternatives whenever possible
Man, Pakistan really loves its yogurt.
Damn, you either can't feed your pets or need to make their own food to avoid buying from these guys..
Oh good, I already boycott them. Minus an occasional Butterfinger bar
Huh, I actually don't buy any Nestle products.
Buycott app
Weird enough, I saw in Mexico a ton of nestle shit being pulled off the shelves. No idea if coincidence or related
Correction. Nestl√© *owns* a lot more stuff.
I'm able to boycott everything on that list...except Digorno.

I don't know why but they poured a ton of money into making the absolute best frozen pizza on the market.
If you eat a lot of chocolate you need to be careful with the amount of cadmium in Ritter Sports though. They get their cocoa from areas with heavy geological activity and so it contains quite a bit of the stuff.
Theo chocolate is really good too. 
wasn't it formula?
That was for chocolate?
I remember that so, hard.
That commercial felt vaguely racist.
Damn it, I really want a white chocolate bar with almonds now.
Great idea, no one's ever tried that.
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or a huge dick.
And?  I heard it.  Large organized boycotts are supremely difficult and don't often affect real change.  That doesn't mean that your average person shouldn't look at corporate actions and vote with their money.  The fact that you aren't changing the world with each small effort doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.

Pointing out that stupid shit about not eating Freedom Fries one time or that Gas Boycott days don't work because duh, doesn't mean I should just give up and give Nestle my money if I don't agree with their corporate culture.

Never mind that the VERY PODCAST you're spamming like it defends your position states: 

KING: And one thing we have noticed is that boycotts tend to be more effective, both in getting concessions and in generating negative-stock price returns, when they tend to be targeted against a single firm.

KING: Boycotts seem to be effective because they create some sort of reputational crisis for the firm that they have to deal with.


KING: If you look at companies that have been boycotted and compare them to other companies that are very similar to them in every way except for they were not boycotted, the boycotted companies tend to do a lot more prosocial behavior afterwards. Or they make prosocial claims.


http://freakonomics.com/2016/01/21/do-boycotts-work-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/
And South Park continues to become more real.
What's worse is that this is the fucking guardian.
What if there the only ones who know the dirt or have the ability to uncover it?

Competitors are good for that. They shouldn't be sponsoring stuff tho, leaking sure, but not monetary sponsorship
Exactly! While I am 100% sure that Nestle is using slave labor I want to hear it from an independent source, not their competition. 
I hate when people try and 'show' me how impossible it is to not buy Nestle.  It isn't hard.  I read all my labels anyway; I have a toddler that I actually care about and don't feed shit to.  I don't buy premade foods; I actually cook and we don't stuff our faces with junk food.  It is actually fairly easy as long as you are not lazy.

Well nestle is literally an umbrella corporation...
But what about Vault Tec?

Found the Amway dealer. ;-)
They are a GIANT Defense contractor to the US Government and are partially owned by Dick Cheney.

Hope you don't need goods manufactured in CA, AZ, NM, TX and many other states where immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America don't speak English. You also may not want to buy products from Fender instruments, VW and Mercedes cars, and scores of other companies that have manufacturing facilities in Mexico staffed by Mexicans who don't speak English.
> Americans are too pussy and too stupid to do it.

Do you own a smart phone? Want me to tell you where some of those metals come from?
What's wrong with hiring Mexicans that dont speak English if they don't need to know it for the job?
> but Americans are too pussy and too stupid to do it.

While there are plenty of idiots and pussies here that's absolutely not the issue. The issue is how *many* people there are. It's difficult but feasible to get most of the people in a little european country to do something because there's simply less people. America, however, has *318 million* people. That's five times the entire United Kingdom. Try getting 318 million people to all do something - *anything* - and let me know how well that works for you. 
Stop being a Troll (looking at your post history), don't try and pass your limitations as a human being on to us.
Specifically, child labor in the cocoa world has been well-known for a long time.  I don't think this admission counts as "pro-active' in any way.
> America doesn't care about slavery anymore, and it cares even less about where its goods are coming from.

okay

>  Nike and many other companies still basically employ slave labor.

okay

> Weyerhaeuser and many other companies still hire Mexicans that don't speak English.

What a damn shame. We should *never* hire *anyone* even *remotely* different than the average American. /s
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
Nestle is so huge that they wouldn't notice your boycott anyway. Buy the water and enjoy the taste while thinking about how little power we have in the world.
> most people go for cheap stuff

And most cheap shit doesn't last - so you replace it, and that doesn't last, so you replace that, endlessly.

For those of us with parents that grew up in the post-WWII depression, you'll noticed a couple of things; a) they're generally willing to pay for quality that lasts b) they're more inclined to seek repairs for their items or attempt to self repair c) less likely to upgrade to a *new* options when their current option works fine d) more inclined to purchase second hand goods that are *fine* but just not *new*.

I'm just a little alarmed at how far we've slide into consumerism and throw-away goods. Yet everyone complains how poorly the economy is doing, how most people are a pay check away from poverty and no one has disposable income any more.

All the while they purchase cheap goods, cheap goods that are not manufactured locally, made out of materials that aren't purchased, sold in stores that aren't owned locally - support the very behaviour that returns no net benefit to our society - we are somewhat buying our way into third world poverty.
Not yetEdit: DIBS
When a company behaves like Nestl√©, they deserve it. 
With good reason. They're crooks. 
Ah, the good ol' "Reddit sure has..." as if Reddit is a single person. And you made this comment in a thread regarding Nestle using **SLAVE LABOR**.

Way to take a stand.
Reddit hates corporations, sometimes it's justified other times not so much. 
Well he's right, there are no inherent human rights..
But how do I buy directly from Thailand without benefiting bad American corps? Or donate for that matter? I'm on board with you, and I want to do it, I just don't know how.
>You're assuming .....

You're assuming that you know what I am assuming...I merely stated there was a bigger issue...as did you I believe.
LOL, you can't READ!  I didn't say they were better off as slaves, I said it was a bigger issue than just freeing them.
You mean to tell me Nestle bought slaves? Do you realize if they did that they'd be striken with hellfire from every developed country right?
Do you have anything to back this up or are you just saying the words?
[deleted]
I can't stop other people from buying their products, and frankly, I don't give enough of a fuck to read the labels on everything I buy. I'm just an every day normal person. I know their ethics are fucked, but so are the ethics of most other big corporations. I may not like what Nestle is doing, but I can't stop them.

If you can actually commit yourself to avoiding their products, power to you. 
It's in the trademark fine print on the packaging. Usually just under the nutritional information. 
Just one of those huge corporations who owns everything...
http://imgur.com/gjGiCv6 

Check out Buycott. It's not perfect, but not bad. There's a specific campaign option for boycotting Nestle products.
Only thing of theirs I used to buy was Purina cat food. Key words are **used to**, fuck Nestle. 
It is called Buycott. I know it is on Android so it is probably on the Apple too. 
There are phone apps for that.

The healthier you eat, the easier it is. I went from digorno, hot pockets, and raisenettes to salad and fish and chicken and such, and most of them just dropped off the map.

They forgot Morrocan Sidi Ali and Ain something.
Wait are these owned by the big-bads or not?
Hey I live bear Aberfoyle
Yeah I don't see a single thing on there that I buy other than sweet chili sauce by Maggi. And I only buy that once every other year.
Malt powder, baking cocoa, and sugar. 
A lot of dishes from that area of the world use yogurt.
Good point, it's important to get 75mg of cadmium (aka vitamin C) daily. If you're pregnant, the USDA recommends 85mg. Ritter Sports is part of a balanced diet. Talk to your dietician if you have problems with renal failure or spontaneous electroplating.
That's the most sexual chocolate since the guy in Coming to America.

I don't feel like writing an essay, i just wanted to point out most large company's exploit the third world in some fashion. 
The anti-Nestle/anti-corporate circle jerk on reddit can be ridiculous. Many of the people posting here are well aware almost all the world's cocoa is sourced from the Ivory Coast, which barely has a functioning government, and where modern slavery is rampant. They blast corporations as being responsible for this while completely ignoring the fact they, as informed consumers, are just as culpable. Once they're done complaining they'll eat a candy bar aglow in their hypocritical indignation.
That is true. I just wanted to inform you of how boycotts dont work :)
Does she know that she's an ad?
Actually, this has become par for the course for The Guardian.
Ok, just stating it can be difficult. You do research, cool, not many do. Lazy isn't necessarily a factor but again, just stating it CAN be difficult
probably a better place to live in than Flint Michigan at this point...
[deleted]
Though the circlejerk will continue. There's so many legitimate reasons to dislike nestl√© so there's no reason why things need to be needlessly spun to fit the narrative.
Aren't they the ones who asked for the investigation in the first place?
They also do a lot of other stuff.  They "tested" the concrete for the Horizon Oil Rig, the one that failed and polluted the gulf with millions of gallons of crude oil.  
Look into them.  You will see all the messed up things they've done over the past 20 years.
Defense contractor? What? They are not a defense contractor
They are a construction company. Just so we are clear. They do mostly very large projects. think oil pipelines, dams, military bases.
I want to hope that he is making the point that companies are chasing after easily exploitable labor. Essentially, if you can read the contract than you don't know how you are getting screwed. Again I want to hope that's what his point is.
Why do these shoes made by slave labor cost 80 dollars? What's your overhead?
because communication is important for all sorts of things. negotiating prices. letting someone know if you dont want to take the job or dont agree with some of the jobs policies. letting someone know if youre being overworked or need medical assistance. you know stupid things like that. not really important though.
I think it would be more accurate to compare the U.S. population to the EU community when it comes to matters like this. The truth is the U.S. is split into many different states with their own state laws and regulations, much like how the EU is comprised of different countries with their own laws. 


It is true that when it comes to politics the U.S. has seen declining numbers in the population actively participating over the years. But population size alone should not be an excuse for not rallying around a controversial topic. It would be interesting to see voting numbers between the EU and the U.S. to get a sense of the difference in voting culture based on population size. 
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
What you say is absolutely true. But at the same time it isn't necessarily the issue with food products. Millions of Americans live in food deserts or simply can't afford foods that aren't subsidized or super cheap. And millions more just aren't educated when it comes to corporate responsibility or nutrition in general.

This is also true with non-food products. A poor worker might not be able to save up for those boots that will last him 5 years, so he has to buy a new pair every year. He ends up spending more on the 5 pairs of cheap boots in the long run, but it's not just boots, it's everything. If he buys nice boots, he has to buy even cheaper gloves, pants, tools, etc. 

Being poor is ironically, extremely expensive. Every purchase you make is a calculation to make this month's money stretch until the next paycheck. And while there is definitely some personal responsibility involved, overall, there really isn't much of a choice. The wealthy elite are funneling money away from the working class by nickle and diming everybody, and the poorer you are the more difficult it is to build up savings because you have to keep getting your car fixed, or new boots, etc. 

Consumerism is definitely an issue though, we are thoroughly and hopelessly indoctrinated by it. But unfortunately, that is the engine that drives a capitalist economy. In order to move away from consumerism, we need to move away from capitalism. 
While we're getting meta - armchair reactionary types are annoying, but people who feel the need to dismiss or downplay big issues like this because they don't want to seem like they're "part of the reddit hive mind" are far worse. 

What change is just ignoring it going to enact? How can people turn a blind eye to this company repeatedly performing horrible business practices?
It's up to the Thai government to enforce their laws. Really it's up to other governments giving support to Thailand so they can enforce better conditions. Private citizens aren't going to be able to effectively funnel support to the right people.
Did you even bother to read the article? Slavery was used by companies in their supply chain. It is generally common knowledge that a lot of slavery occurs in that part of the world on fishing ships
http://www.foodispower.org/slavery-chocolate/ 

Thai shrimp boats are even worse - they literally chain the "workers" to the boats.  It makes the Chinese electronics slave camps look like Club Med.
This isn't a repost, it is in a different sub. Even if it was you should read the reddiquette. It specifically tells you not to bitch about reposts, which this isn't. As far as changing the title this is a news subreddit, if you change the title it will be removed. 
No. App, now.
Im going to be checking everything now
That's very outdated and is missing a lot of Nestle products. 

Examples- Nestle owns a large share of Haagen Daas Ice Cream with General Mills, owns Butterfinger, does not own PowerBar (anymore) and it's seriously missing all of their frozen pizza brands which make of 4 of the top 10 frozen pizzas by sales.

Additional edits:  General Mills does not have Jolly Green Giant anymore and they now own Annie's Organic.

I think people should also know that these brands are often sold off to private equity firms that turn the brands into cash cows by slashing overhead and headcount. So just because it's not owned by a Fortune 500 doesn't mean it's any better.  To reiterate points above... these are commodity products. Find small/medium companies you love and stay loyal to them if you can afford it.

Edit 2: Butterfinger is on the current chart.. I couldn't see it the first time
I think this site will just make me sad.  Not sure what the options are for [chocolate not produced by child slaves.](http://www.buycott.com/campaign/companies/494/boycott-chocolate-produced-by-child-slaves)
Did you just switch over to an all-sawdust diet for you cat instead or did you upgrade to a cat food that is actually edible and digestible?
They are all nestle. 
I don't think anyone else realized you were joking lol.


You sound like you want to repeat what happened to child miners in Congo.  The US passed a law to help ensure child miners weren't used, and as a result US companies left and Chinese companies that don't care at all took their place.

Even if you think they're bad, western corporations are one of the few ways we can directly control things in the third world.  If GM is in Thailand, Congress can pass a law to make it have better health standards.  If it's a Japanese company Congress can't do anything.
Except for the part where boycotts against individual companies do work.  As the podcast states...
Which is what makes it worse.
Lead in the water or Zeds in the streets... hell of a choice there...
Apparently you missed the giant /S right there
I think it's more that a company of nestle's size could have found out about the child slavery sooner. Granted, I'm likely part of this circle jerk, but as stated, there are other reasons to hate nestle, and I've been boycotting for far longer than this article.
Yes. As indicated by the story posted by OP Nestle initiated the investigation through a third-party investigative firm.
Not a Defense contractor? They made 39.5 BILLION dollars off the Iraq War through government contracts. I suggest you really look at what it means to be a defense contractor. When our government pays you to do "Security", ship fuel, handle logistics, for a war, that company is a Defense contractor. When you have two divisions of your company that supply a private army full of ex Delta Force military personal, you are a Defense contractor.

http://leaksource.info/2013/04/08/contractors-reap-138-billion-from-iraq-war-cheneys-halliburton-1-with-39-5-billion/

They do much more than construction

You can get a better idea of all the cookie jars they've had their hands in.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton

I don't think most laborers in the US read contracts, regardless of their native language. Just a hunch. At least for the employees of the many American and European companies manufacturing in Mexico, the natives would be able to read their contracts. But I hope you're right about what he was trying to say.
Then they either shouldnt take the job or deal with having bosses whose first language is English. It isn't the manager's jobs to teach their employees a brand new language just to do manual labor, and I'm willing to wager most of those laborers would rather be working that job anyway than not working at all.
Nah jk fuck that I'm going to keep giving money to the company who shows us time and again that they are awful.
Go after the country then. Why go after Nestle?

It's like me opening an international sandwich shop and finding out there are slaves working in my shops in Asia. What do I do? I can fire the one who works there and has all them, but it will only fill again with slaves. Close the shop? I have workers who need to be paid internationally.

Is there an App though where you can type in a brand name and know how well they are rated on the scumbag scale of life ?
Maybe there's an app for finding an app.  Or even an app for finding apps that find apps.
Buycott.com
Yeah I see that Kraft is missing Philip Morrris also. Somebody should make an updated one for Reddit, this picture has been around for years.
So just more shitty junk food that you shouldn't eat to begin with?

For water just use faucet with a filter if you don't like the taste (unless you live in Flint Michigan). I don't have a pet so I don't know how difficult it is for that but if everyone stopped buying the rest of their garbage, the company would fall apart.

Edit

People below seem to be agreeing with me yet I'm bring downvoted. Interesting...
The fun part to me is that Hershey is bad, but Cadbury is good, but in the US, Cadbury is run by Hershey. So in the US, both Cadbury and Hershey is bad, unless you can find the REAL Cadbury as an import and not just what is generally on store shelves.
Lindt is the only chocolate you need.
What about Ghirardelli?
A lot of the fancy fair trade chocolates at places like Whole Foods are amazing. 
Nooo I switched to an even better cat food, and more wet food less dry. I forget what brand I got but it's more expensive than Purina, not a huge brand, and the main ingredient is actual meat not "chicken meal" or anything like that. 
Not everyone can afford fancy feast
The illusion of choice!
The problem is the first world is stagnating and taking away economic growth from the third world that would naturally occur otherwise. 

Don't put words in peoples mouths.

Except Nestle has one of, if not, the longest organized boycotts against it in history and, during that time, has become the biggest food company in the world. 
With the zed option there's the infintismaly small possibility that you get a shot at Jill Valentine or Milla Jovavich. I'm choosing that one. 
You would be surprised how stupid people are about that thing... I once made a point about how people treat cancer patients badly by making a sarcastic comment involving a child with cancer. You would think i had admitted to killing a litter of kittens.
Apparently you missed the little "kinda". There is no kinda about it. One is a video game company trying to make money. The other is using CHILD SLAVE LABOR.
some people dont have that many options
Americans defending corruption. Number one country.
I am sad to see that cynicism destroyed your hope so quickly. Poor little booger.
> Go after the country then

Well its private companies that are doing it

> Why go after Nestle?

because they are a major international company that is directly supporting the slave trade.

> It's like me opening an international sandwich shop and finding out there are slaves working in my shops in Asia.

Not really even close to the same thing since in one situation you are in the city and can inform the authorities or run. In the other situation you are on a fishing vessel in the middle of international waters for months at a time

> Close the shop? I have workers who need to be paid internationally.

If a company can't be profitable while paying its employees properly then it shouldn't be in business at all/
>Go after the country then. Why go after Nestle?


Cause they knowingly did it?

> What do I do? 

Treat them like human beings and not property.
In 2010, Ivorian government authorities detained three newspaper journalists after they published an article exposing government corruption in the cocoa sector.[7] The farms of Western Africa supply cocoa to international giants such as Hershey‚Äôs, Mars, and Nestl√©‚Äîrevealing the industry‚Äôs direct connection to the worst forms of child labor, human trafficking, and slavery.[8]
He is probably the kind of guy that takes an ipad to a concert and records the entire thing with it, vertically.
From wiki:

>Number system
The first digit indicates the number system to be used for the subsequent digits. The following number system digits and their numbering schemes are:

>0, 1, 6, 7, 8: For most products. The LLLLL digits are the manufacturer code, and the RRRRR digits are the product code.


So you would probably only need to have the nestle manufacturers and you could store that locally.  When new manufacturers hit the market you could update the app, or just a local black list.  Ski you really wouldn't need an internet connection when scanning.
[Overall, Nestl√© owns over 2,000 brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands).

You're simply going to spend a couple of hours before each supermarket trip memorising them?

**... WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?**
Taking a picture of the box means you're looking at the box anyway lol
What if there's multiple items you want to check. Do you want to pick up each one individually and spend 60 seconds reading fine print looking for a tiny nestle logo, or do you just want to point your phone at it? ***i can make anything seem bad by comparison!***
The future is now!
It's hardly surprising considering there are apps for reminding you to exercise.
[deleted]
You don't need an internet connection, and you can't just look at the box, you have to remember which brands are Nestle subsidiaries and which aren't (they aren't required to list parent companies on labels and there are over 1400 subsidiaries).
That or simply a website. Probably does exist but I don't like looking up things like that on my phone
Well considering I've worked in 4 of these companies in the past couple years I suppose I would be qualified for it.
It feels kinda smug to look through that list and know you're avoiding most of it just by not ingesting shit, but fuck it, I don't mind being smug once in a while. 

Pet food can be difficult, but not impossible.  Costco brand cat food is made my Diamond Foods, rates well, and doesn't seem to support anything too terribly awful.  Please don't prove me wrong internet, I want to keep it simple. 
There is literally not a single brand of pet food on that entire graphic that I would feel comfortable giving my animals. They're all mostly corn. The least shitty one was Iams, which is still pretty bad.

Spend a little more and get something like Premium Edge or Diamond. They're not top dollar fancy like Taste of the Wild, but they are infinitely better than any of that shit, and your pets will have better coats, eat and shit less because they're actually getting the nutrients they need and absorbing more of what they're consuming, and they'll have an easier time maintaining a healthy weight.
Anyone in the UK feel like illegally exporting some real cadbury chocolate through the mail? I'm buying!

I didn't miss it, I wrote it. You're taking what was intended as a joke about E.A. receiving the title of worst company in the US entirely too seriously
Shut the fuck up.
Ahh, letting people who don't speak a language work for you. So corrupt. In no way helping somebody put food on the table who has few options. Nope that's corrupt.
Nothing I'm talking about has anything to do with American corruption. Exploitation of labor maybe but even that point of view doesn't have much of a leg to stand on when you're only using the language barrier argument we've been discussing. In many cases, American companies having plants in Mexican cities is mutually beneficial. 
Something like this needs government intervention in order to end a corrupt archaic system, not boycotting a coffee company. Companies WILL go to the cheapest place to do business. Why do you think it's so cheap to do business in China? That's what you get for being a capitalist country. Profit is the main goal of any company. Whether it be Nestle, Apple, or any other company using cheap methods to turn a profit. You might as well boycott the iPhone, let's see how well that goes.

> ...., vertically.

What a jackass.
TIL that Friskies and Dog Chow are Nestle brands.
I just shop at trader joes. They don't have nestle products
Au contraire!
good. be sure to fix 7up too. 
Cadbury was recently bought by Kraft and has since been adulterated. Their Creme Egg sales have apparently plummeted because of this.
This was the beginning of what they called "The Chocolate Railroad." 
your logic implies its an either or scenario. It is not, both sides of the issues feed into on another. 
No, but that idea gives me an erection. So... How would I do that? When I tried to microwave them they just died... So, that was clearly a mistake.
I guess some people find slave labor as something to joke about and others dont. If that gets me downvotes so be it.
Literally nothing you said addresses a single thing I said and its all common knowledge. Why do you feel the need to imply I said things I didn't even come close to saying?
You must work for their PR firm....  http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/nestle-california-bottled-water/
What's got into that cat?!

....child sweat and tears.
>They don't have nestle products

How do you know?
Wait, so even the good cadbury isn't the good cadbury anymore? Because that 'chocolate not produced by child slaves' site definitely lists Kraft as a company to avoid, but not Cadbury.
That's funny, because Kraft is on there, too.
You would make a terrible ambulance 
And some people just cannot handle things on the Internet.
I hope that passion about child labour extends beyond calling out jokes on the Internet. 
Because they barely carry anything that is a name brand. I have also been trying to avoid nestle for years and know a lot of their products.
Cadbury these days in UK tastes like chocolate scented candles and has a similar texture too. Try Divine chocolate instead as it's about as close to original Cadbury as you can get these days.
I can say the same to you.
27 years....?!? Holy smokes.

Hit 'em with the bill and call it a day.

"That will be $12 Billion, plus penalties and interest."
nice to know the government is so efficient and keeps track of its revenue streams
They'd be in hot water, too bad there's barely any left.
And here I was thinking they couldn't get a better deal than the $2.25/million litres of water they get in BC.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nestl%C3%A9-b-c-water-deal-too-cheap-says-ndp-1.2964709
So that's why my Nestle Purelife is so cheap . . .
This title is misleading. Nestle has filed all the proper applications for their permit and paid all fees for the past 27 years. The state water authority has failed to act on the permit applications, state law allows the permittee to continue to operate until the permit application is acted upon. 

So, if you'd like to blame the proper party, blame the California Forest Service .
Now is time to fuck Nestle hard.  Hit em with a multibillion dollar fine and make them pay for harming the environment.  Nestle is a corporation solely motivated by profit, so hit them where it hurts.  Plus, budget windfall!
This is all a pointless distraction. Stop the bottling plant tomorrow and California is no less fucked than it was yesterday. 

Nestle uses ~244 million gallons per year which sounds like a lot so people are up in arms. Almonds in California use about 1.1 trillion gallons per year which makes Nestle's use about 0.02% of what almonds used. Compare it to agriculture as a whole in the state and its another order of magnitude smaller fraction. Why are people not boycotting stores selling California almonds? Crashing the demand for almonds would do more to save California than stopping Nestle from bottling some water. 

 
I would just like to note, nowhere in the article did it mention that the permit expired 27 years ago.
This is not even close to the [worst thing Nestle has done](http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards).
While this figure may be unpopular, Nestle's water use is only 0.6% of the total of all the water currently used by golf courses throughout the entire state of California.  Currently, golf courses use 0.9% of the entire State's municipal water (http://www.golf2020.com/media/31918/ca_golf_full_rpt_sri_final_7-mar-2013.pdf - page 20).  About 324,246 acre/ft of water is used by all of these courses.  Nestle's 705 Million gallons equals 2,160 acre/ft of water.  So, in essence, it's a drop in the bucket (see page 22).
[deleted]
when will people realize that using up all the resources to profit now means that overall they will not profit...

like a farmer selling loads of produce, but then we run out of water
guess what? you can never sell produce again and now you own worthless land
I've been boycotting Nestle for years.
Not that Southern California needs more expenses, but why aren't they backfilling the water shortage with desalinization plants?
Let's not forget that while Nestl√© is piping clean water out of the state for their bottled water sales, there are over 1 million residents in California without access to clean drinking water.
"In response to the online petition, Nestl√© Waters North America issued a statement saying that it used 705 million gallons of water last year, which the company says is about the same amount of water needed to irrigate two golf courses."


How the fuck big are those golf courses supposed to be?!
STOP DRINKING BOTTLED WATER! Problem solved. Buy an aluminum bottle and fill it up at home, work, restaurants, etc.
You know what would be funny?

What would be funny is if when a company/corporation or group of people does something that they like this that they know is harmful to the public, and are not properly punished by the judicial system because of buying powerful people off, the people wronged by the company/corporation rose up as a whole, swarmed that establishment, and tore it down, piece by piece.

They can't jail you all.
They could simply claim they are extracting dissolved solids and using water as the transport.  No i'm not helping them, I'm innoculating us from their inevitable future lawyer bullshit.
Should be charged the 27 years worth of sales plus interest. 
[removed]
And what will Brown do about this? Fucking nothing that's what, the fucker keeps passing legislation on residential water usage, but is too damn scared to bite the hand that feeds. 
I don't understand why Nestle had to set up bottling in a desert.  That's what Southern California is, it's a desert!  Why not set up water bottling in an area with lots of water like the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi River System?  The Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second (7,000‚Äì20,000 m3/s).  per [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River)

Nestle's Water Bottling wouldn't even be an issue there yet they want water from one of the driest states in the country.  It just doesn't make sense to me!


Wow at the people getting mad at Nestle.

They use 250 million gallons/y, which is nothing at all.

Almonds industry in Cali uses 1.1 trillion gallons.

So Nestle uses 0.02% of the water the Almonds industry uses. This is just propaganda from the real abusers, Nestle is an easy target but what they use is literally a drop in the bucket.


"Now that it has been brought to my attention that the Nestl√© permit has been expired for so long, on top of the drought ... it has gone to the top of the pile in terms of a program of work for our folks to work on"

I think the two Bobs need to have a chat with the San Bernadino National Forest Supervisor....

There's more than meets the eye with this article. It's Chinatown. 

As someone that has worked in marketing and politics, I have to tip my hat to the people that convinced [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0fPTQDIUAANrGR.jpg) woman that she needs this product. It's all about perception of status and ego. Her and her's do not drink tap water like plebs...
Is this a case where the guy who was supposed to renew the license got fired and nobody else knew that it wasn't up to date so they just kept on going?
reminds me of this article http://o.canada.com/news/nestle-bottled-water-cost
The main problem with Nestl√© seems to be that they're getting so many advantages over others. A similar amount of water would probably have been drunk anyway, but that's no reason to mandate that they profit from it. If a publicly owned company could've sold that water to people at a much lower cost to the consumer, then private ownership is not in the public's interest.
[deleted]
So will Nestl√© be charging California for allowing Nestl√©'s permit to expire?  Because that is really, really, rude.
It's frustrating to read how every industry in California is claiming that another uses more water to justify their practices. The greed and blame shifting will turn that state back into a desert and send all those residents fleeing east unless a unified and binding plan is developed. 
But if your food stand permit is even 1 day old they send the cops to shake you up.
While I think Nestle has acted poorly, I think much of the reason people are getting mad is that now that Californians are being subjected to the water restrictions *they should have been using for years* they are lashing out and looking for someone to blame. All the better if it's a foreign corporation, then no one in California has to take the blame. Except maybe the politicians.
Fuck Nestl√©...
And Fuck Kevin!
How to rally reddit, steps:

1) Have a drought

2) Ignore the fact that 80% of the water goes towards agriculture, specifically items (like almonds) that soak up massive amounts of water

3) Pick a corporation, any corporation

4) Make them the target even if it's .05% of the water

5) Get pitchforks

6) ?????

7) Profit
But their bribes to the current governor and legislators are completely up to date.    So no problem.
Maybe this is just me, but if I were a state suffering a heavy water shortage, I'd be killing permits of people bottling my water. This would have happened long before the people who lived in my state were required to "ration" their water and pave their yards.

Call me crazy, but I'd probably not care much about the minor jobs and taxes generated by these companies, and focus more on that long term stuff.... You know like hydration.
Wasn't this the plot of Grapes of Wrath?
Just make it so they can only sell the water in California. 
As per usual, the corporation will be hit with a fine which is only a tiny percentage of the profits they made from their exploitations. 
Time to check Coca cola's water permit.
This is just as much the fault of the permit office or whoever. Idiots.
Yeah, so they just con'd their way into a water contract up here in PacNW.  Got some small city to give up their water for 40 jobs.  Super lame.
Sounds like they've been stealing for 27 years.  
Nothing will happen here, I'm calling it now.

It has all the markings of being 'forgotten'. Nestle doesn't seem to care: We use the amount of water in a year equivalent to watering 2 golf courses.

The reg agency is just saying: They'll investigate. They're in the pockets of big business and won't fine them a dime. They'll probably just renew the permit and let them continue...

Callin it now.
Delicious manufactured scandal.
Meanwhile how much water does CA's ag consume using outdated irrigation methods?
Bottled water is an insanely tiny drop in CA's water usage, guess Nestle forgot to send Jerry Brown his check.


But hey, as long as the limousine liberals feel like they are making a difference.
Nestle will act like Cliven Bundy.
More shocking: "According to estimates by the Public Policy Institute of California, more water was used to grow almonds in 2013 than was used by all homes and businesses in San Francisco and Los Angeles put together."
All in favor of 27 years in back payments plus interest?
If they can't pay a large fine and all the past due amount they should have their company taken by the government and sold off, but we all know what's going to happen. Nothing.
I would charge them 10 million for every year they were with out a permit. That should put them in their place. 
Someone's in some hot water...
Someone please inform Peter Brabek that "water isn't a human right" and he will have to pay for it.
For that long they paid off people for less money than the fee to renew the permit? Fuck it let them have it! This planet is going to shit, we got what? 100years if we keept it at 11/10? Let them pick up the pieces, Im tired of helping the rich and in power
Now now, lets be fair how about we charge them 70 billion dollars,  AND they have to return every fucking drop of water they stole. 
Welp better fine them a million dollars.
Sue them for a dollar per gallon of the water they've stolen over the last 27 years, or else they must return all the water; their choice.
Cash only.  No fucking chocolate 
The same company making dog food that is killing dogs. Not suprised. 
Can I sue them for forcing me to unknowingly be part of a conspiracy to defraud California? I've drank about 10,000 bottles of their water in my life that they were technically legally not allowed to sell me.
How much of the water in the state is  is used by bottling?

0.000001% ?
I have to cut my already tight water usage by 25% or get a huge fine and Nestle gets to bottle water and sell it back to me? That is some bullshit right there. 
I'm that they will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  
    

What's the point of a permit if the authorities aren't even checking if what Nestle is doing is permissible? Shame on Nestle but even more, shame on the forest service for snoozing on the job. 
Good.

Now link the drought to them and shut them down.
There is no use in today's world for bottled water at all. There is no need for it, and there is no excuse for continuing to make excuses for it.
So.... basically the year I was born.... that is FRIGHTENING.
nestle has been fucking us all for years
0_0 27 YEARS Christ... 
I wonder how in the Hell California authorities let this slide for 27 years given they have been in a perpetual drought throughout most of that period. Nestle ought to get a prize for showing yet another, and likely massive reason they are faced with such insane water issues. Whether it rains it not, enforcement of permits should be at the top of the regulatory commisions priorities. 
Thought the title said days ago and was all angry. I don't even have words for how I'm feeling right now after I re-read the title....

I can't drive my car with expired tabs without getting pulled over. This company can continue to make shitty water for 27 years without a permit? 
With proper campaign contribution it can go another 270 years.
Wanna bet that the company did not stop putting money into the pocket of politicians 27 years ago?
How do we mobilize reddit to fight back against these fuckers? I'm totally serious. We're being asked to take shorter showers and not water our lawns but then THIS?!
Are you fucking kidding me?
Big business. Can't go interfering with that just cause some little ole permit.

Liberals killing companies one by one. 

They are on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians' reservation, they most likely fall under tribal sovereignty, so good luck with caring about a permit...
wow they could only get 27000 online signatures?  
"That'll be $400,000 fine and $100,000 into my personal fund"
yeah? no.  Permits like this are based on market value, usually established by an appraiser.  This is a pipeline permit in a forest.  The highest and best use of the land under that pipeline? Still a forest.  The actual dollar amount on the permit will be negligible.
Not to be a downer, but you understand absolutely nothing will come of this, right?
How much money would each person get in California with 12 billion? 
I suck at math.
How do you feel when you find out it's all the states fault for not following up on renewal requests and that Nestle has paid it's permit fee every year keeping the old permit in effect until the state acts on the renewal request?

http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/

>In a 1993 letter, then-District Ranger Elliott Graham wrote that because the company had kept paying the annual fee and had complied with regulations, "the permit is deemed valid until a new Special Use Permit is reissued."

>Lawrence said Nestle has sought to renew the expired permit several times and is ready to work with the Forest Service.

>"We just have to work through the process," Lawrence said. He said Nestle is waiting for word from the Forest Service on the next steps and would welcome "a science-based study of the watershed."


>"The Nestle permit is just one of those 360. It's not like we've purposely held that one out," said Al Colby, a public services staff officer who oversees permits. "The thing is that Nestle continues to pay the fee that they were charged back when the permit was still valid."

>Because of that, he said, the expired permit's conditions have remained in effect. "Basically as long as they're paying the fee that was established before it expired, the permit is enforceable."

>The national forest has continued to collect a permit fee of $524 from Nestle Waters each year.
> "That will be $12 Billion, plus penalties and interest."

Which just comes from the customers anyway. Doesn't hurt the company one bit. Take the money out of the paychecks of the people who run the company, *that* will matter, but overall fines just fuck over the customers.
And fire whomever is supposed to keep an eye on this shit. California sure as shit never forgets when my car registration payment is up for renewal.
Make it a trillion.
and replace every gallon of water "stolen" into california reservoirs.
And they'll settle for 1.2million 
The way water rights work in the west is a bureaucratic nightmare.

i cant imagine this was on accident that it was "forgotten" about
Revenue "streams" indeed.
but you know, if you or i filed late we'd be in deep shit the next day
It's very likely upon the corporation to ensure their permit is up to date.

If your vehicle registration expires and you get stopped by a cop, does he raise hell with the DMV? Hell no. He issues you a citation and fine for not keeping your shit up to date.

I have a feeling this is going to work out really bad for Nestle. They've had a lot of negative publicity lately, and then there's that drought.

I hope California takes them to the cleaners.
Once you make large "donations" to their bosses they'll gladly forget about you too. No worries. 
Good one.
yah. good laugh.
Is your name a reference to Luigi Vampa from The Count of Monte Cristo?
their ceo is a fucking asshole, he wants to privatize water
For a huge corporation, this is water off a duck's back.
Mmmm. Nestle cocoa.
And yet in Vancouver it costs $2.480 per 2,831.6 litres so why aren't they getting the same rate?
For anyone who actually cares about the facts, that cost is to run a provincial water management centre.

There is no reason to charge farms (who use more water in a day than nestle does in a year) or nestle for water that would flow into the sea.
They are sucking down Florida's dwindling supply too.
Cite needed.
OK, so it didn't expire 27 years ago?
Punish a...corporation?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
All corporations are motivated by profit. Fuck Nestle though, they have been destroying nature for a long time now.
> Nestle is a corporation solely motivated by profit

Ah, but you repeat yourself.
This is where China has the right idea. The CEO should be put on trial.
Yeah it's all about those evil corporations. Let's just forget that the regulator was too incompetent to catch this for 27 years. 
A company that only cares about profit? What for-profit companies actually don't put their bottom line as the #1 priority?
Fuck nestle?  How about "fuck California". They're the retarded little brother bringing rest of the country down.  Fence that shithole off and let those fucks run out of water.
Are you stupid? They still paid for the water they took. They will pay nothing and rightfully so.
What would motivate a for profit organization besides profit? Wouldn't that just be a charity 
Everyday 38billion gallons of water are used in california (source: usgs.gov). If the estimate of 700mm per year is accurate, or even remotely accurate, Nestle's effect on the California water crisis is quite literally a drop in the bucket. 
TL;DR Nestle is an easy target, but not actually a substantial cause of the problem.  Their entire bottling operation uses about as much water as irrigating a couple of golf courses.
 
Yeah and people actually drink that bottled water. 
This "Nestle is stealing our water" story keeps coming back. I'd really like to know who's pushing it and what they're trying to distract us from...
I'm sitting here in Kentucky drinking some Nestle water now. California had some damn good water.
It seems like the almonds are being grown where the water actually is. I know Northern California is full of almond orchards many near water sources like lakes and rivers. There is less of that water due to lack of rain and snow, but when you look at how much water is sent south so people can live in the desert with golf courses and pools it seems silly to blame almonds.
Here's one: why not boycott organic farming for sustainable ag? Uses way less water, still affordable. That and make farmers pay for water in non-1930's prices so that they are incentivised to grow more drought resistant crops 
You're damn right about everything you said, but they should still get butt fucked for knowingly breaking the law, and exporting the water from such a drought stricken area. That corporation is scum, and though the cashcrops are the real problem, nestle sure isn't helping. 
Not to mention, people are drinking the water Nestle bottles.  It's not like they are pouring it down the drain.

As far as boycotting almonds... most of the almonds go to China anyways.  This is something you can't vote against with your wallet.  This is gonna require state government action.  In other words, ain't nothing ever gonna happen.  
All this is true, but what Nestle does is extract, use vast amounts of energy to bottle, sale at high price that California never sees and leaves us stuck with the plastic bottles.  Golf courses bad too, but at least agricultural produces something useful.  Nestle does not.
> Why are people not boycotting stores selling California almonds? 

because for me that would be literally every single store. oh hey, there's some blue diamond farms about 2 miles away from my apartment.
Exactly. California's water problem is due to its unwillingness to drop farm subsidies. The industry accounts for 2% of the state's GDP but 85% of the state's water consumption. 
>Why are people not boycotting stores selling California almonds? Crashing the demand for almonds would do more to save California than stopping Nestle from bottling some water.

Hopefully it's coming.
http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/

Tl;Dr: it expired and didn't get renewed because the underfunded forest services has a 30+ year backlog when it comes to permit. Since Californians continuously vote tax raises down they have got noone to blame but themselves.
What is really popular is making comparisons for overall use when a resource is not distributed equally. Inside or outside California.. as California tries to suck the rest of the West (e.g., Utah) dry as well. It's unsustainable, drought or no drought, period end of story. 

‚ÄúIt is Californians' God given right to water their lawns.‚Äù ‚Äì Sen. Dianne Feinstein

Keep electing them!
I'm honestly shocked that I don't eat/use a single Nestl√© product. 
Because "they" plan to be dead before it actually affects them.

"They" is the people currently profiting at Nestle, not some fictitious Nestle-as-a-person with actual long-term self-interest in mind.

The fiction of corporate personhood is dangerous for numerous reasons, but assigning "rational actor" behavior to assume reasonable behavior from corporations is up there at the top.

Corporations no longer care about long-term sustainability.  The people involved have realized that they can maximize their profits over their own lifetime by pushing all the consequences off until they are no longer directly affected by the fate of the fictitious person.
That is capitalism in a nutshell. Capitalism is an unsustainable economic system. 
In this case, I think they will still profit even after resources are gone. It's a situation of use it until you lose it, and then use something else. If free groundwater supplies dry up, they can move to rain water collection or river diversion (which has been done). In an extreme case, they'll go to desalination, and people will have to pay $5 a bottle because all the natural sources have been bought and sold. Something similar has already been happening in the fishing industry. 
They don't care, they won't live long enough to see the results.
> when will people realize that using up all the resources to profit now means that overall they will not profit...

Actually, when compared to state use of resources, profit = sustainability.  Profit is the best way to know that you're using a resource efficiently.
A Swiss company taking advantage of our loose laws that they can't get away with at home.
San Diego so far.
>there are over 1 million residents in California without access to clean drinking water.

And Nestle not being there would not change a damn thing.
The water is removed from its local ecosystem and shipped across state where it sits on shelves for an extended duration of time. Once it is consumed, a trace amount remains trapped in the bottle, often with the cap replaced, and is likely scrapped rather than recycled. 
this is a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the water usage. Going to arms over this might make a good political target but the real issue is trying to grow monsoon crops in a dessert 
There's actual springs in our mountains in Southern California, and the water table in the mountains can be pretty close to the surface. 

For instance, when I went to 6th grade camp in  the early 90's, We went on many little hikes along the spring beds around Mount Palomar, and the Councellor guiding us on the hike let us know that he, himself had accidently popped this spring up less then a year before while digging a hole for a trail marking stake. This isn't a fluke thing either, and generally artisan springs can be found all along the sierra Nevada mountains. Palomar Mountain Spring water, Arrowhead spring water. Nestle water is also from a naturally occurring spring. Crystal Geyser  spring water is also bottled in California. Generally if you're on the west coast and go to buy spring water, it's probably going to be from California.

But you are not wrong, Southern California is generally a hellholeish desert... just not in the mountains... and it doesn't change that bottled water and public consumption of the water doesn't dent our water supply much... it's the agricultural demands that really suck the moisture out of the state.
Not all of Southern California is a desert, their bottling plant is up in the Mountains.
Because Ghiradelli had San Marino...
Strategic bottle-ing. Plain and simple, you have over 20 million people within a hundred mile radius and you have the largest port in North, Central, and South america a 90 minute train ride away (Long Beach). They make massive transportation savings by bottle-ing close to the point of sale
My suspicion is that Californians drink a lot of bottled water and its cheaper to bottle that water close to the point of sale than to truck it across the US. 
The amount they take is nothing lol, they take 0,02% of what the almond industry in Cali uses, the amount Nestle takes is equal to watering 2 golf courses...
They don't seem to have permission to use the drop.
Any incest involved?  You know what we do with nosy guys?
NYC tap water is better than most bottled waters in taste and quality.  Proven fact.  Of course it comes from the Catskills.. but from reservoirs.
If I send in my forms to renew my driver license after 5 years and don't get a new one in the mail, guess I can assume everything is a OK.
Good luck with that

The applied for a renewal in the 80s. To this day that application is on backlog. 
Seems that way.
Sponsored by Kraft Food.
[removed]
jobs and taxation are not exactly minor or short term things you know 
You know, bottled water helps people live, versus the over 1 TRILLION gallons used by almonds.
As far as I know, they just use plain old tap water for Aquafina.
They filled for a renewal 30 years ago and paid their dues on time. That story is 100% the fault of californian government services. http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/
Same as in North Florida except the legislator made that one happen.
http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/
So it is cool what happened?  Just let anyone do it without a permit?
And most almonds were shipped over seas.  So that is a great excuse for everyone else to waste water?
Of what?  They have been filing the paperwork. They have been paying the fees. The state forgot to process and log those papers. 

So you want Nestl√© to get 27 years in back payments and fees for this bad publicity?  

Nestl√© does some evil shit. But this one wasn't one of them. 
except they have been paying for the last 27 years, California is the one thats messed up the permit renewal 
Are you retarded? It's not even a US company.

Also, the fault here is with California, they KNEW the permit has expired, but Nestle still paid them money every year so they just let it be.
http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/

The applied for a permit in the 80s and the forest services failed to handle that request for 30 fucking years.
I kind of doubt they paid anybody off, the government is just generally useless.
Charge them for what? Using as much water as a golf course?
So let's party down with it then.  
But if they don't bottle the water, where will it come from?
The drought is by nature, it's not caused by anyone. However the drought symptoms are exacerbated by Agriculture using most of the water in a state, to grow water intensive crops, but the biggest problem being, we're using water to turn a desert to farmland. Sure it's temperate year round, but we're just using water like we expect it to just fall from the sky at regular intervals, which in CA, is not historically accurate. 
There is honestly some use.  Convenience and portability come to mind, especially in places that don't have clean water.  But I question whether that should be the role of a private company, particularly one that doesn't believe that water is a human right.
So consumers will pay more?
It already has a huge tax on it.. it's called the "hip 'n stupid" tax. 
I liked the idea of banning certain sizes of water bottles though I think that was more of a landfill waste issue. No amount of tax or ban will stop the sale of bottled water if it gets bad people will find a black market to buy them from. It happens all the time with smokes. 

Bottled water has its uses such as disaster relief or with contamination issues
True. All that "wealth" spread like a plague to the neighboring states and made housing unaffordable, dragged along gang graffiti, McMansions, SUVs, and increased pollution. People will not even say, "Good morning", or look at you on the street. Ah, progress! 
You must be from someplace nice like New England then.  Certainly not from some southern shit hole with high teenage pregnancy rates and politicians in your bedroom.
That's funny because the forest services can't handle the permits because they got their budget cut to a point where they have a 30 year backlog on handling those permits.
Aquafina is just plain old tap water.  Blind taste tests have shown NYC's water tastes better than most bottled waters, granted it is from  the Catskills.
Yep. A few years ago we bought a proper filtering device and have been saving $80/mo. since.
Well if you had to wait for 30 years for new tabs you wouldn't blame yourself or would you? The applied for a renewal in the 80s.
It's excellent water not shitty.
They are in Florida, so of course they are there.
If people stopped buying bottled water they would stop producing it. 

Nothing drastic needs to be done.  Remove demand and supply goes with it.  The problem is sometime over the last 25 years people convinced themselves that tap water = poison.  
Get mad at the almond industry, Nestle uses 0.02% of the water the almond industry uses lol. This whole article is distraction
Which company might that be?
Wasn't that land least to those Indian then they least it to nestle?
Naw, a legislature vote can be bought for about 10k each.
Tropico is the most realistic!
$400000? Thats a win! we were never going to get 12 billion anyways. /s
Exactly, it's not like they haven't been paying for the water for 27 years.  It isn't even a permit related to buying the water.  It's just a use permit from the forest service to transport the water.  

Bottled water is pretty goddamn stupid, but a lot of people are being mislead by the click-bait title.  
Uh-huh.  And what about *penalties for violating permits*?  Which is what we're talking about?
My understanding is that they are on tribal land, and that is just slightly out of the reach of local giver enemy.
After the shit Nestle has pulled of in the past, this is probably a cake walk as far as getting past it. 
> absolutely nothing

I'm sure they'll have to pay the fee for the past 27 years and perhaps a small penalty.  So, you know, *something* will come of it.
About tree fiddy.
Lol. You get nothing. It will be used to build a bridge to no where. 
You'd think that being in what is mostly desert we'd would be more careful.
hehe, that's gold rush legislation. *maybe* it's time to move on?
The way everything works here is a bureaucratic nightmare.

Yea because our government is completely incompetent. And it's been this way for 30 years, which means at this point - it's fucking insanity.
Oh fuck off. If you read around the situation developed because the forest service is so underfunded after countless budget cuts that they have a 30+ year backlog when it comes to these permits. http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/
Mmm, yes.  Jolly good laugh!
No, it isn't.  These stupid fucking puns are ruining Reddit.
Yeah, it is! Cool of you to notice.
something something job creators.
Because you don't pay for the water you pay for the infrastructure. They run their own wells. You guys are beyond simplistic.
I'm assuming that you're referencing the municipal rate.

Households that are connected to the municipal water supply and sewer pay for the maintenance of those systems, the treatment of water entering those systems, as well as the treatment of waste water returned via the sewer.

Households that are not connected to the municipal water supply or sewer must install their own wells and septic tanks. They pay nothing for the water, but they do need to pay to maintain their own infrastructure.

Nestle's operations fall into the latter category. They don't pay for the water but they do need to pay for all of the equipment needed to take advantage of it. It's not like they can simply turn on the tap and fill bottles all day long without paying a cent.
Because bulk purchases are almost always cheaper. Thats pretty simple actually 
There is when nestle just gets to charge people for it instead. 
as a floridian they can suck on my dwindling supply .

Below is the correct story, directly from the Desert Sun. The DS is the newspaper that originally did the investigation. 
It did but you are allowed to continue the operation while awaiting a decision on your renewal application. While you're title might be correct it is very very misleading and out of context 
I'm sure they'll be punished as severely as BP..
It's sad how easily big companies get off on their punishments :(
All corporations are motivated by profit, this is true. Some corporations are motivated by more than profit though. And even if they don't have better motivations, they at least have a set of ethical boundaries. Nestl√© has none of these.
You say profit as if it is a bad thing? Should it not be applauded?
Because regulators are supposed to police *every regulation ever issued*?  No, this is a matter of corporate responsibility.  Nestle broke the law, and was caught red handed.  They deserve to get hit with punitive fines. 
If you fenced it off and cut them out of the union, they'd still have one of the largest economies in the world.
So what's the point of issuing a permit then?  Why not just set a price and let Nestle pump all the groundwater they want?

They subverted state law and threatened water resources during a fucking drought.  Why not kick them where it hurts?
According to this article, it's closer to 5, although the source may be biased.

Still, there's no silver bullet to the problem but likely a lot of little steps.
Golf courses usually use grey water, so not quite the same.
The politicians who currently are running California into the ground, to name a few. They keep spouting the idea that this crisis is somehow from Nestle and residential water use, while agriculture is really what's draining us dry. It fits the green and anti-corporation image that's so popular these days, and it shifts people's focus from the real problem to non-issues. Nobody wants to touch the elephant in the room, which is agriculture is wasting more water than everything else in California. But no one running California has the balls to enforce greener and more efficient farming methods, because these farmers hold most of the voting power in Central California. That's why even Governor Brown can only run a dog and pony show trying to convince everyone it's the golf courses and climate change causing the shortage. Yet the industry that accounts for 2% of California's Gross State Product and 80% of our water is untouched and ignored. Ya, 2%. It's always about politics.

http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=1108
It's just like the anti-Yelp stuff. People have built up a narrative in their mind and parrot what they've heard without actually applying any critical thought to the situation.
My thought is it's coming from Ag interests. This seems to get way more coverage using a small percentage of a percentage of California's water than the Ag industry, which uses 80 %.

Let's all rally against Nestle, those bastards. Don't look over here, we're just growing food! (and hay for export and almonds that use 10% of all of CA's water, etc.) while using farming practices that are the most water wasteful in the world. An alfalfa crop in Imperial County will lose 4.5 acre feet of water (per acre) to evapotranspiration. Basically, it evaporates, because they water the fields by flooding them, rather than using water saving irrigation techniques, because it's cheaper. Oh, and they pay $20 per AF for water.
Nestl√© is a much easier villain than California's agriculture. For many economically depressed regions, agriculture is the main industry with the political clout to match. You are going to wreck a lot of towns' economies if you cut their water usage in half.
It is coming from people in California shitting their pants because they are afraid of having no water
My bet is that it's a marketing company employed by a competitor. 
Your water isn't going to be bottled in California anyway. It makes little economical chance to transport water all over a continent. IDK about the exact situation in the US but even my 8 million people country of Austria we have more than a dozen bottling plants.

The fuck does that have to do with anything ? You somehow think they should be able to double dip on the water ?

>leaves us stuck with the plastic bottles

So because people don't recycle the bottles it's Nestles fault?


Do you not have a sales tax? That'd be revenue directly going to the state from the water.
Please cite your source for "vast amounts of energy". Also, the 72% of the bottles are recycled. http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/Notices/2014/Biannual.pdf
Feinstein, like all politicians, certainly have their levels of idiocy.  
Utah should just suck the east dry then.
Lawns are silly, but very little of Cali water goes to watering lawns. It's mostly agriculture

No, the fact that you can freely type such BS from the modern technological marvel that is a computer, in a well lit home with climate control while sipping on a Mountain Dew scratching your unshaven itchy scrotum through your Levi's, all affordable commodities these days to most anyone, is capitalism in a nutshell.  

All of these things took thousands of men and man hours with resources from around the planet and innovations that took decades to develop, all to work together to produce these things that you have chosen to purchase, and here you are typing the most hackneyed college freshman level BS criticizing the very system that allows you such choice and comfort and the freedom to speak your idiot rhetoric.

It's also bottled on a mountain in New Hampshire.
But water travels downhill, so when you take it out of the mountains the rest of it becomes a desert.
And? If you want to be angry, scream at the Cal gov, who knew exactly the permit expired but were fine with it because they still received the money.
There are minor flavor fluctuations in public water but it's all the same shit. My friend insists on using a Brita filter and I have tried to explain that there is nothing a half a cup of granulated charcoal is going to do to that water that hasn't been done.
Absolutely, until someone pulls you over and figures it out.  Until then you're good to go.

Neither is water. It's kind of one of those necessities.


I'm not sure how water became "neither is water", but I'll lay it up to my sausage fingers and its late at night.
Missing the point but then again, this is faked outrage.
If they were paying the fees, okay then. I thought they were doing it all for free.
hmm, Sounds like there is blame to go around..

No, so they quit smok.. err.. drinking. 
Yup, fuck em. Bottled water is fucking ridiculous. Anyone who buys that shit is seriously retarded. Like, *actually* mentally deficient.   
Also, yes.
Sure, that's a good bottom-up method. And it'll work if people can ever be unbrainwashed. In the meantime, there are plenty of people whom this outrages, and who I'm sure would sign a petition at the very least to, say, fine nestle for the years they weren't operating with a permit AND to prevent them from using CA property for water during an extreme drought. It's ridiculous.
I don't know about that particular reservation, but the reservations I am familiar with, are all owned by the tribal nation and operate as independent nations from the United states. There are laws that allow them to share things, like currency, but they also have the right to their own court systems and law enforcement, and disallow law enforcement outside without permission, and other courts to rule against their nations.

They fight very hard to ensure precedence isn't set through federal court to undermine this.

Haha, I love Tropico - what a great game.  And so fucking real... just absolutely brutally realistic. This shit actually happens and has been happening for like hundreds of years.
> Bottled water is pretty goddamn stupid, but a lot of people are being mislead by the click-bait title.

That's not entirely true.  I've lived in a small town or two that was way over defensive when I inquired about their safety reports (wanted to know whether to trust it for infant formula).

Town governments can get away with almost anything in the south.
Bottled water is awesome. My water tastes like absolute shit. I need a britta, but still bottled water has uses. Especially for people without running water.
Its a pretty hot button for some on Oregon, Nestle, our Governor and the city of cascade locks are trying to side step public input and sell spring water, currently used to help restore salmon runs, to Nestle. They've been blocked for years so now they want to side step the system.
Almond Tree Fiddy.
Lol. I think it's even funnier that you thought I thought that we'd actually get money.
I was asking hypothetically. 
It actually developed *because* water is so scarce.  Prior appropriation is actually stricter (in general) than the alternative system. In wetter states (riparian water rights), anybody with property on a river can draw pretty much freely from the river.  On the other hand, in prior-appropriation states in the arid west, it's actually much more difficult to be able to draw water.  Even if you have a river on your property, you can't draw from it unless you own the water rights, and you are limited in the amount you can draw by the seniority of the water rights you own.

Also, the permit in this article is only barely related to water-rights.  The permit was actually for the transportation of water through a pipeline, not the original appropriation or purchase of water.


Oh, and in prior-appropriation states you generally can't even harvest rain water which falls on your property because someone downstream owns that water.  That typically strikes people as totally nuts.

It's an interesting conundrum for the sustainability crowd because obviously they like the idea of being able to harvest rain water, but the people down stream with the most vulnerable water rights are often the small organic farmers who don't have enough water to grow the local produce everyone loves so much.   
Thanks for the foul language. I did not say anything about the forest service, but about their bosses. So much for reading comprehension. 

Budget cuts come from where again? 


Well.. I'd be happy to buy that shit in bulk and just pour it out into the waterways, if I can get the $2.25 per million liter rather than paying 2.48 per gallon...
No, Mr Florida that's a bad thing. This is how the problem started.
Salt water encroachment. Already opening a desalinization plant.
Yeah, our groundwater is receding at a crazy rate. There's been land elevation drops in areas due to excessive groundwater usage.
Yes, probably from their precious wetlands that are drying up and killing off wildlife.
Sea level rise, combined with growing usage means if you water your plant with tap water too much it dies from salt poisoning.  Because of the limestone which of course allows the springs, sinkholes, etc., it also facilitates ocean water sliding in to replace what is used from the aquifers if the amount used is greater than replacement rate.   All water has salts in it but not sea salt.
The problem is where the water goes. Wetlands are great sponges for water; suburbs aren't. So while Florida gets a lot of rain, a large chunk of it is running off into the ocean. This means that during relatively dry times, Florida has to rely on its groundwater instead. This causes issues like salt infiltration and sinkholes.
Really?  Where at?
The more the aquifers get sucked down the more the salt water encroaches in its place. 
Don't blame him he is most likely just an intern at a marketing company.
But you have to understand that they're [deeply sorry](https://youtu.be/_AwD_7yNzKo?t=34), so it makes up for it!
So Joe Barton will issue Nestle an apology?
"Get off on something" is used to express that someone experiences sexual excitement.

"Dave really gets off on torturing me, doesn't he?"

What you are looking for is "to get away with something", as in "Nestl√© got away with animal abuse *again*!"


Publicly traded corporations are required by law to only make decisions that are in the best financial interest of their shareholders.  When ethics meets profits, the company is compelled to make the decision that is expected to gain them the most profits, not the ethical one. 
I never said profit was a bad thing. Profit is what business is about.
I would hope they would notice after that long. 
They took 0.02% of what the almond industry took, they took absolutely nothing.

Also you can't sue them, because the Cali gov knew all the time they were still pumping, but were fine with it because they got their money.
And my source comes directly from Nestle, so the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  


It¬¥s because Nestle is foreign, like BP. ¬¥Foreign companies are ruining our beautiful country omg!¬¥
> Basically, it evaporates, because they water the fields by flooding them, rather than using water saving irrigation techniques, because it's cheaper.

And because of the insanity of the prior appropriation water rights system, those who have the oldest water rights (i.e. farms) are *guaranteed* to get their water, and if they consistently don't use it, they'll lose it. 
Flood irrigation is a major problem in California, no doubt. Alfalfa farmers who are using cheap surface water, or pumping unsustainable amounts of groundwater need to be reigned in. Same goes with almond farmers who flood irrigate.

However, almonds are getting an unfair amount of attention because: 1) there are hundreds of thousands of acres of them in CA, and
2) they have a relatively low water weight compared to many fruits and vegetables.

An acre of almonds uses 3-4 acres-feet of water each year, which is about the same as strawberries. So why aren't strawberries getting more heat? Because they have a lower "gallons of water per pound" figure, since they hold more water than an almond does.

Lettuce uses [between 1 and 2.5](http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r441311511.html) acre-feet per acre in the summer on the CA Central Coast, and between 3-3.5 acre-feet per acre in the SoCal desert. So, in the Imperial Valley, that's about the same water use as almonds grown in the Sacramento Valley.

I could go on, but I think you'll see my point. There are something like 20 times more acres of almonds grown than strawberries or lettuce, so they use a fraction of the total amount of water.

Alfalfa is the biggest "water waster" in the sense that it uses around 5-6 acre-feet of water per acre per year, and there are about 1 million acres of alfalfa grown in CA.
California has around 1,000 golf courses. Nestle uses as much water as two of those 1,000. If water conservation was really the issue wouldn't golf courses be a better target?
Really, how do they get made and re-cycled?  How much energy consumption?  How much petroleum? Also most end up in dumps or the oceans.  The oceans are now full of our plastic debris.  Most of that water is being sold to Californians.  It goes every where. The point is that it is a waste to let a company to do this, not that it is the worse thing in the world.  And it is not the only place Nestle does this and we know from a fact in Florida that they do it because they made the right campaign contributions.
If it is sold in California.
Only if the water is sold in California. 
Bottled water is tax exempt but we pay CRV on all bottled waters, soft drinks, pre-brewed coffee and tea drinks, beer and small juice bottles.
72% of how many?  Compared to not making them, given it uses petro-chemicals to make them, the energy is vast and since google is not your friend, http://www.banthebottle.net/bottled-water-facts/
> Feinstein, like all politicians, certainly have their levels of idiocy. 

Just follow the money. You may need the help of the CIA though. ;)

North. The East already sucks. 
Yep, and a shit ton of the agri-water usage is for almonds.  Fucking ALMONDS!  While delicious and healthy, it's one of the least important staple crops ever, but the crop that requires more water to grow than almost anything else.
Yes, but the important bit is the not the ratio of water use for lawns vs total use, but the insane justification for it. 
Try this: It is Californians god given right to electrocute criminals. The ratio of electricity used by electric chairs vs whole electricity use (and associated pollution) is vanishingly small, therefore justifiable? Not important? 
That's not going to end well.
capitalism, pure uncut capitalism, does seem to be unsustainable, tho. 

Like, that's not even freshman econ101, that's 8th grade US history when we learned all about monopolies and laissez-faire and shit.

How is the world *ruined* right now?
Why?  

I make a good amount in the stock market every year. I bought my shares from the open market, so it didn't really benefit the company itself. Those that own stock and work in the business obviously would benefit, but why would me being able to save a large amount of money and be able to grow it so I can retire in my old age ruin the world?

The alternative is that no stocks are sold to help fund te businesses. Super rich are the only owners and benefactors. A normal person no longer has partial ownership of companies. You have to save every penny you will retire on. Remember to account for inflation in that number!  I hope you can afford to live on only half your paycheck. 
It's not stocks *per se*, IMO, it's when somewhere along the line people stopped caring about getting steady dividend checks and became obsessed with mere speculation, buying low and selling high. Ever-increasing stock prices became the goal, not high dividends.
Without public companies, the world would not be better.  Instead of millions of people owning small shares of companies, they would instead be owned by a select few powerful people.  If you wanted to get a return on your money, you would be restricted banks which give you next to nothing or the bond market.  While both certainly have their uses, only holding equity in a company gives you any say over what they do.  
I've always wondered the possibility of a separate index for socially responsible companies where investors seek a return greater than profits. Maybe stocks traded on a factor of monetary return and societal return. It is an interesting concept...
Let's is "let us". Lets is a verb.
Nestle USA is a separate corporation
So European?
The water that flows from my taps comes from a water table three blocks from my home. When used, it gets filtred before retyrning to the reservoir eight blocks away that communicates with the water table. What I water my lawn with still remains a part of this ecosystem as the saturation and evaporation are local to the source. Trucking water 300 miles from the source is not local.
"why do I come here even."

Presumably because you enjoy being a condescending douche but find it problematic in personal interactions. Do everybody a favor and dont come here if you cant rise above the shitty attitude. 
Camp Fox or that other hedonistic camp farther up the mountain?
some of the places have multiple spring sources. There's two Crystal Geyser controlled springs in California. Point being that there's a LOT of water bottling going on in California, not just Nestle.
I agree with you but you obviously haven't tasted water with higher salt in it like around the Gulf areas or sulfur like you will still get in Florida.
ya and ignoring one for the other is how we got in a mess in the first place so all I'm saying is we shouldn't make the same mistake twice
Californian voters who vote down every tax proposal ever are ultimately responsible. if you gut a government agency to the point where it simply cannot handle its task anymore its your fault.
What a concept!  
Can Nestle get in on some of that action?
So.. Don't punish the company...
>to prevent them from using CA property for water during an extreme drought

Or alternatively, they could worry about something else.  Maybe something that doesn't use a tiny fraction of their dwindling water supply, but instead something that uses an absurdly large fraction.

Or, you know, keep making noise about bottled water while Big Agriculture screws you. Whichever.
Well, you *can* do something, but the amount of work you'd have to put in is immense compared to just writing a comment on reddit.  You could at least attempt to run for public office for example.  You could vote in a third party, even if you think it is a vote wasted.  You could start up an anti-corruption organization.  You could report corruption to the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/corruption) or the [United State Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usao/priority-areas/financial-fraud/public-corruption) or follow this guide to report it at the [United States Office of Government Ethics](http://www.oge.gov/About/Mission-and-Responsibilities/Where-to-Report-Misconduct-in---/).  Obviously, some of these options are more or less impractical than other, but all are *possible*.
Does the state manage this? I thought it was the US Forest Service

Get yourself elected and don't be corrupt? 
Run for public office. Then cash that campaign contribution check. He'll anyone can use 10K. 
It's California state legislature, each of those seats have a ton of voters and many are probably inexpensive media markets. The cost to win a seat probably greater then some nation house of representatives races. The campaign contributions is probably fairly high. Least legal bribery is probably also more expensive in CA.
You do realize that even small towns in the south have to pass the same EPA regulations as anywhere else in the country?  The Safe Drinking Water Act means federally authorized monitors inspect all regions equally.  
Republicans.  Normal.

Lived there most of my life.

A shame there are only 2 parties.  Idiotic.
People who say bottled water is stupid has never had the pleasure of drinking the treated water in Phoenix. 
Yeah and the budget cuts came along becasue of corruption....
And now the state collapses in on itself because a few billion was too much for desalination.

Hate to break it to you, but regulators are notoriously underfunded.  They are overextended and often are legislated by their states to keep their noses out of certain industries.
This is one plant, of course they won't take as much water as an entire *industry*.  However, any amount of water is significant considering the severity of this drought.  

Of course you can sue them.  They were pumping without a permit.  I can pay however much I want; however, if I don't have a permit, my payments are void and mean nothing.

They deserve a multibillion dollar fine for negligence.
Well, BP *did* actually dump a bunch of toxic chemicals into our waters causing shrimp to be born without eyes and an increase in fish lesions from 0.1% of stock to 50%, along with a ton of other problems.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill#Environmental_impact
While I agree with your points, I don't think the crop gown is really the problem. The problem, IMO, is they are irrigating a desert. If there were unlimited water resources, maybe this could make sense. But as California has become drier and drier, Ag has make little or no change in their methods. They pump so much ground water in the Central Valley that the ground has sunk 28 feet in some places. Every discussion I had with a farmer goes the same way: "we've been through this before and it'll pass" so they'll pump the ground water out until none remains, waiting for the rains/snow that never comes. This attitude in spite of the fact that most scientists are convinced that this is probably going to be the "new normal" for California's climate and it will get much worse. That is just irresponsible and selfish.
There are really two states here. Northern California which is suffering from low rainfall and snowpack, but still has rivers and lakes. Southern California which is suffering from low rainfall and from low snowpack but has no rivers. 

Northern California isn't exactly thrilled to ship their water down south to irrigate those golf courses
"most end up in dumps or the oceans" is bullshit. California has a recycling rate of 72% for beverage bottles. http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/Notices/2014/Biannual.pdf

Also, to suggest that the do it because they made the right campaign contributions is ridiculous. They do it because people are stupid enough to buy something that they can get  out of a pipe in our kitchens (for nearly free) for an inflated price because of a perceived convenience.
I wasn't arguing for the use of plastic bottles. I was pointing out the fact that an argument claiming something as fact should, in fact, use facts. You claim that the process uses "vast amounts of energy", I simply asked for a source. Do you have one? 

Your link has some questionable numbers. It claims that the bottle water industry uses "17 million barrels of oil annually, enough to fuel 1.3 million cars for a year" A barrel of oil produces 19 gallons of gasoline, so 17M barrels is 323,000,000 gallons. The average mileage driven per year is 12,000, average car gets roughly 21 MPG. If you do the math, that comes out to enough fuel for under 600,000 cars. 

Any organization that uses inflated numbers to make their point should be immediately suspect in all of their claims.
So we should expect at least one person in an agrarian society to LOVE producing things as boring yet utilitarian as tampons? 

Ooga booga capitalism! 
> These things would still be made even without the immoral profit motive.

There's nothing immoral about being motivated to profit from your actions.  Everything we ever do is to profit, whether it be monetarily or psychologically.  But both are the same means to an end: happiness.  These mythical people you think who would move mountains without the 'profit motive' also feel they are profiting from their actions, so really you are just spinning your wheels using these silly catch phrases.

> To profit is to charge a person for a value greater than the value of the good or service.

Why would someone purchase something unless they also felt they profiting more form the purchase than by abstaining?  Market transactions are a two way street where both people exchange feeling they are profiting from the transaction.  And there goes your argument.    
Why would you invest your money there though?  Why not invest some of your money in whatever you are using for your retirement and donate the rest to a non-profit of your choice?  That being said though, being socially responsible can also be profitable.  Many companies now make a lot of money by marketing themselves as eco-friendly, locally sourced, union employed, or whatever.  Additionally, not causing a massive industrial accident due to carelessness is also good for the bottom line.  
Except those are out there?  Those exist. 

They don't do as well, but they do keep up with inflation usually. Just don't grow past that much. 
Separate, or child organization and Nestle in Switzerland is the parent company?

Hmm I can't even remember tbh. It was around 17 or so years ago.

May as well complain about a ravens color to a crow for all the good that will do you.
Just thought you might be interested in this. I'm trying to gain support to draft legislation that defines oppressive laws and makes it easy for citizens to have those laws thrown out. More importantly, the people that wrote, signed, and enforced the law would be arrested and charged with crimes of oppression. This would act as a deterrent for our current oppressors. Even if the legislation isn't popular initially, if it EVER passes into law the oppressive elements of our government would still face prosecution! It would be a threat, even if it is just a draft. I'm far short of the education required to draft a legitimate piece of legislation that could ever get the job done. But I'm passionate about this and have thought about it for years. It will take a diverse coalition of people to define "oppressive" and get a workable draft put together. But I think this could be one part of the turning point for our nation. I'm giving a speech about this in two weeks. I'll be recording it in video and putting it on the internet. Hopefully it will get the attention it needs and the ball will start rolling.
The thing is many of these things are flawed for me. I'm 23 so running for public office while maybe possible is not actually going to go anywhere. This also kind of takes off the table going to the FBI or the DOJ, they don't take reports on corruption from 23 year olds very seriously no matter how clear it is. Also the lines on what is bribery have become so blurred now that there are many ways for corporations to get that money to a politician in a way that skirts the law. I will say I have not tried starting an anti-corruption organization might give that a try even though it would be one of the hardest options on the this list.
Can't i just blow up a capital building instead?  That seems like it would be more efficient.
Yeah, but not all local governments are honest. Some don't follow the rules.


Yes, and requesting information about those reports led to a couple menacing return calls(demanding to know who had given me the idea the water might be unsafe), and a visit by the police who claimed they had to search my house because of a 911 call (we didn't even have a land line).
If they are underfunded I doubt they inspect everywhere equally
There are some ways to avoid this if you're willing to break some rules. I used to work for a company that built and upgraded water and wastewater treatment plants. 

A lot of times the EPA will require that a piece of equipment is installed, but then the operators will never run it because of the cost/maintenance headaches. Other times they'll run it, but with most of the flow going through a bypass.

For situations where the EPA is monitoring output, well the EPA isn't always there. And data can be backdated, especially if its only for brief periods when something threw you way above your limits before coming back down. EPA requirements on continuous monitoring can also vary anywhere from continuous emissions limits to 30 or even 90 day running averages. So maybe the plant had a good few months and they can stay online with a lot of bypassing during the next maintenance crisis and still make their limits. 

Most of this stuff isn't bad enough to harm people, but it is enough to make you look at it all and shake your head in disgust
My drinking water bleached clothes.  This is no shit, had a washing machine sticking in the rinse cycle and clothes would come out bleached.  We don't keep bleach in the house.  Called the city, they told me the machine passed a bleach bubble.  I asked if my faucet passes bleach bubbles because I drink that, she laughed and asked if I need anything else.  
The water in Socal isn't that great. In fact when I lived in the city of Orange, the water came out of the taps chalky white. Everywhere in that city.
Ah, good ol' valley dirt water. One of the best parts of moving to Flagstaff was the tap water not tasting horrible.
Nah, someone voted on it, right?

The local health department tried to close a bunch of food carts down. Unsanitary and in violation of oohh so many regulations (like using the ice for drinks AND washing their hands [extra flavor, I guess]. Citations were issued, never went anywhere, because the carts where 'minority' operated. Politics intervening in health enforcement. Every day, every level. 

Management are political appointees: Fracking and EPA. Neutraceuticals and FDA. 

Sure, it's not a catch-all explanation. There are some unpopular choices that have been made, e.g., net neutrality by the FCC. It'll get sorted out. 

But what do you know about the TPP? 


No problem.  It has always been a problem there but as you know, Florida is now the third largest state in population?  
One more thing, not just a problem in Florida, but entire Gulf Coast.  Not as bad because they don't have the aquifers like Florida does being drawn down, but even in the Houston area, you need to wash the salt out of your watered plants often and when you taste the water there and compare to say New York water, you can taste the salt.
I'm glad you included it!
You have no fucking idea what you are talking about. They wont pay a penny and rightfully so.

>The problem, IMO, is they are irrigating a desert.

Yes, irrigating deserts is probably a bad idea, but the whole state is not a desert. As weird as it sounds, the delta is actually a pretty good place to grow rice because of the high water table. I think it was a mistake to import water from the Sacramento River south to, say, the [Westlands Water District](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-westlands-20141021-story.html#page=2), as large portions of that land should never have been irrigated and now produce toxic amounts of salty runoff, which they've convinced the feds to pay for in a [secret deal](http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/San-Joaquin-Valley-farmers-reach-secret-deal-in-6007151.php). It was also probably a mistake to import water from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley. However other areas, in the northern part of the state, like the Salinas Valley, Napa Valley, and Sacramento Valley, should continue to produce food because they actually get rain.

My question is, what should we do with the water from the Sacramento River or the Colorado River? How much should we divert for human needs? Who should get priority for that water? People have been farming with that water since the 19th century and have legal rights to it. Should the people who live in the arid southern part of the state get any of that at the expense of the farmers who hold senior rights over that water, or should they come up with their own solutions like desal and improving water efficiency?

>They pump so much ground water in the Central Valley that the ground has sunk 28 feet in some places

This is a major problem, which is being addressed with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, at least in regards to the Central Valley. I think the timelines are too generous to people who over-pump, but it's a good start.

>"we've been through this before and it'll pass" 

I think this attitude will change when groundwater becomes more expensive than surface water in 2016, or 2022 (depending on how long a few bad apples try to game the system). I agree, it is irresponsible and selfish, but so is watering a golf course in Palm Springs, or eating a hamburger, or filling a swimming pool in San Diego. 

There's no one simple solution. Should we put a moratorium on housing development in the state? Housing prices are already high enough, aren't they? Should we cancel contracts for imported water to the desert areas like the Imperial Valley? Should we put a cap on the number of cattle? Should we let tens or hundreds of thousands of acres of almond or pistachio trees die? How do we balance growing food with supplying drinking water?

Not a suggestion.  It is exactly what happened in North Florida.  And where did the other 28% of how many billions of bottles go?

Yes. I never said it would be easy. 
Dude let me know anything I can do to help. I'm 17 so I can't vote yet, but I do want to help make a difference
You will *always* be able to find a reason *not* to do something.

I'm not pushing towards activism, just suggesting you be more honest about your reasons for *not* doing anything. 

There are several state legislators around the country who are your age and younger. I also believe there is one at the federal level. So please don't suggest you can't participate at that level because of your age.

Also, the FBI and DOJ will judge the merits of your claims based upon the evidence you provide, rather than your age when you provide it. So please don't suggest you can't engage them because of your age.

Nobody will think poorly of you for admitting you simply don't want to do the work. Most people feel that way. But if you come up with bogus reasons, you will inspire people to waste their time trying to explain your 'misconception' and help your towards your supposed goal.
I'm not saying their definite solutions, or even feasible solutions.  I'm just trying to put some options on the table.
In my time here on reddit I've come to realize that I shouldn't believe half the shit that people put up because it can't be proven wrong and so many people either lie for karma or because they just don't want to be wrong.

So I'm going to call bullshit on this particularly outrageous story.
Having lived around the county ( but not the south - except Florida ). Every town we have gotten water from in the last 15+ years sends an annual water quality report. Some places we were on sewer and a well, but still got a municipal water quality report even though we were only a sewer customer. I think it's required. 
How serious of an issue are we talking here?  
The wife and I are planning a move to Ft. Lauderdale in October, work is all lined up but I wonder how much we're shooting ourselves in the foot by moving from the midwest...
Yeah, because my username isn't just a rhyme and actually indicates my political beliefs.  What a stupid comment, I guess I shouldn't have expected better coming from a person named eldrich01.  

Anyways, since you're not providing reasoning on why a company pumping *without a fucking license*  cannot get fined, I'm assuming you're just saving face because you have realized how fucking stupid you sound.  Really?  Just because a company pays with an expired license doesn't mean it's legal *at all*.
I understand the whole state isn't a desert, but most of the ares that they are growing crops in is a desert (Central Valley and Imperial Valley). 

I think a realistic approach would be to grow in areas that actually have enough consistent precipitation to sustain the crops, without importing or depleting the aquifer. Now, I'm also realistic enough to know that will only happen after the water is all gone, unfortunatley.

However, based upon the numbers, the state is using about 6.5 million acre feet than nature replenishes. That being the case, if Ag were to use only 20% less water, Ca would be self sustaining, water wise. That is less than all of the other users have been required to cut back, it shouldn't seem unreasonable.

As far as water allocation, the Colorado was divided up based upon the flow during historically wet years. So, the Colorado River Compact needs to be revisited and revised, based upon more current and accurate information. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Compact

If the water use gets reduced to the point of sustainable, the water rights end up not being an issue.

Should there be a moratorium on building? Probably. You cannot build anywhere without insuring that power, sewer, etc. is available. Why should water be different. But it would only have to restrict building in new locations that require new resources. You could still allow redevelopment of older areas. That could actually be a huge boost to some of the otherwise undesirable areas, there are quite a few of those.

Cap on cattle? Maybe. I have trouble understanding how feedlots in California make more (financial) sense than some of the areas in the southern US.

As far as a balance? Again, based upon the facts, if Ag cut back their usage even close to the same as all of Ca's other users, the problem would be solved.

BTW, I lived in Ca for most of the past 40 years. I moved out of state about two years ago.




Sooo... Capitalism?

This trope about the Nigerians is getting very old mate, they're one of the richest countries in Africa, it would be nice if someone could mention the word Nigeria without someone leaving a racist comment about 419 scams.

Without getting political, Florida down that way, the closer you get to Miami the worse, floods every year without hurricanes.  The good thing is the sandy environment causes it to drain real fast, the bad thing is that is the majority of the drainage system because it is sand.  So as long as you have checked out carefully flood potential where you intend on living, I would not worry about it, just be aware not to drive down flooded streets. Just don't expect insurance to cover issues in flood potential areas without paying through the nose. 

The water situation only keeps getting worse and so far they have not shown any willpower to deal with it.  Can't say how that will all end.

I am from there originally as is basically my whole family.  Loved the weather, not the infrastructure.  As long as you don't care about the cat eating lizards they are now trying to eradicate, and so far the pythons don't seem to be a big problem in urban areas, then go for it.

No one said anything about race, except you.
I'm not asking you to. They were suggestions for someone who wants to try to make an impact. Anyway, voting third party, or reporting corruption cost nothing. 
Start with an internet search: "How to run for public office"

Add your state or city to learn requirements for local offices. It's more time consuming than money intensive at the local level, and the youngest legislators have succeeded by investing that time.

And yes, there will be a chance to make a difference. Many of them. Every day. Wether or not you get elected.
You have 14 now! I'm calling shenanigans! 

J/k honestly your story isn't particularly unbelievable or outrageous, some phone calls and a check up from the cops? Don't see what's so crazy about that.

Cat-eating lizards? I'm in FL and I know about *lizard*-eating *cats*, because I've had several...but what is this about cat-eating lizards?
Well that is the thing about lists. They don't weigh the value of the people on them at all because they are morons. See the sex offender registeries where "raped 23 kids" an "once urinated in public in a park where a child might have seen him when no children were around" both put you on the list.
The actions of corrupt and weak politicians is what is inappropriate. Words spoken with malice are nothing in the light of the actions of the corrupt. Wishing harm upon these scum is not an offense.
OK I'm wrong because I said racism, whatever.
Voting booth closes at 6, work ends at 6; cost: early leave. Reporting corruption in a corrupted system is a joke. 73 old donor kills a man, cop backs him up. Nestle's water right expire TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS ago, nothing happen. The government have been spying on its people, which is unconstitutional, for years and nothing happen.

No need for a recall, just some creative marketing.

"It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno's BowelShredder Pizza - now with glass!"
Stouffer's meals contain food?

Edit: This joke being made, I fucking *lived* on Stouffer's Mac and Cheese and their Lasagna when I was in college. Frozen dinners wouldn't be as bad if they didn't jack them full of god damn sodium.
This is crazy... i just contacted DiGorno after I bit into glass... it was in my spinach and garlic pizza.  They sent a courier from about an hour away to pick up the glass.. upc.. and manufacturers code.... Maybe I should have asked for something for compensation.
I just ate a DiGiorno pizza :/
Sounds like the most supreme pizza ever to me.
Glass in the Digiornos?! What do you want on your Tombstone?
Aw, crud.  Nestle owns Stouffer's?  I've got to look up a list of companies to avoid.
About 5 years ago, I found a huge chunk of scalp in my DiGiorno pizza.  It was seriously like someone grabbed a large handful of hair and yanked it out, skin and all.  It was actually underneath all the toppings and the cheese.

I sent them an email not because I was angry (though I wasn't happy), but because it takes some serious quality control failure to let that happen.  Someone clearly had a very bad day the day that pizza went down the line.  They asked for a number on the box to identify it, but I had already thrown it away.  I haven't had one since then.
I was in the supermarket today and considered buying a DiGiorno pizza....I was in the mood for shitty oven-recooked pizza and I'd never had DiGiorno's before.  I passed on it and because of this article will probably never taste DiGiorno's.
It's not delivery.  It's De' shrapnel!
Hey that glass eating guy from my strange addiction will enjoy the new flavour they are making.
It's not delivery. It's Glass! 
Phew, the Stouffer's Meat Lasagna is not affected. Easily the best frozen one you can readily buy.
I ate a DiGiorno Pizza for dinner tonight, still alive.
"Thith lasagna tasthes like pennies..."
Does this mean I think glass is delicious? 
How the hell did they get glass in the food?
It's not delivery, it's death!
Makes me feel a lot better about serving my kid those dollar Totino's pizzas.
I'm glad I stopped eating that shit.
Best bet is to stay away from all Nestle foods.
What was the glass source?
Meanwhile at Nestle Inc........

They're making damn sure they get Nino Schibetta this time.
It's not delivery; it's intestinal hemorrhaging. 
I'll still eat it over Tombstone.
Annealed down and fell over when I ate a slice!
**DiGiorno or delivery?**
They should recall their pizza for removing the cardboard cutting board. Tombstone it is. 
A few years ago in Sweden there was a big affair involving alleged pieces of glass in frozen chicken. Several people reported findings in chicken. Hundreds of tons of meat were recalled. The Security Service got involved as intentional sabotage was suspected. The story dragged on for weeks if not months before fading away. In the end, lots of the "glass" turned out to be something else entirely. Now it looks like it might have been a mild case of mass hysteria.
Geesh, I have one of the ricotta and spinach ravioli Lean Cuiaine's in my freezer right now. Glad I saw this thread. 
pizza tastes shit anyway
Spinach on pizza. Magna-barf.
Luckily I already boycott Nestle products. 
I thought those onions cut my mouth up more then usual...
Happened with delissio pizza too some days ago.   Maybe someone is runing aroung spreading glass all over the food forfun lol
Nestl√® quality care strikes again.
This wouldn't be a problem of people would just boycot all nestle products and it's affiliates. Seriously people, nestle is owned by a goddamn super villain. 
Doesn't surprise me coming from Nestle. 
Seriously, how does this shit happen?
taking all the nutrition out again, tsk
Good job Reddit. We get the vegetable lasagna here at work in bulk. Things like this makes my job easier.
"It's not delivery, it's an ass full of glass."
I prefer to think of it as half-glass free. I'm an optimist.
The glass shards might actually be a slight improvement.
Nestl√©s child labor force must be revolting.
Well, let me know when DiGiorno recalls their pizza for containing cardboard.

Wait, that's the main ingredient.
In their defense it was supposed to be sand (ie: parm cheese), it just didn't get all crushed up enough.
I guess they put the Almost Pizza in the wrong packaging.
"hey it was sand when we put it in there, it must have been exposed to heat during shipping"
It's not delivery it's DiGlassio 
Nestle owns these products. I'll never buy them again. Chemically processed poison. 
Maybe they should change their slogan to "DiGorno's:a cut above the rest"
It's not delivery, is Di-*ARGGH GOD DAMMIT! WHY IS THERE GLASS IN MY FUCKING PIZZA? THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE!*
Man, I always saw right through their bullshit. 
It's not delivery; it's glass.
"The glass may have come from the spinach used"... Never had that kind of spinach before
The glass has a higher nutritional value then the food itself. It's all shit, don't eat that stuff. 
What do you want on your tombstone? Here lies a dumbass who had his throat slit open by glass on a digiorno pizza. Its not delivery, its choking on your own blood
Well, good thing I wasn't craving [spinach artichoke ravioli](http://puu.sh/nCkD9/97d614d3b8.png) tonight
Oh so that's what it is. I thought the bloody poop after eating their food was normal.
I literally just ate a DiGiorno pizza.

O_O

>DiGiorno Thin & Crispy **Spinach** and Garlic Pizza

Oh, nevermind. 
Fortunately I don't eat any Nestle products, because Nestle is a shit company, so I'm in the clear! 
It's not delivery, it's death!
It's not delivery, it's *diverticulitis*.
These comments are sharp
At least they didn't recall them for ass in food.
Within 30 minutes of eating a Digiorno it turns to water, so I think Im safe.
This is getting scary.  I don't remember ever hearing something like this 20 years ago.
The takeaway here is clear: spinach is the devil and will murder your face.
Thank god the Stouffers Mac and cheese is safe
Thank you for the summary - saved me a lot of frantic searching.
Yep, pulled some of these from my store just a few hours ago. You should be fine if the expiration date isnt 2017
>spinach

Whew, dodged a bullet there.
An important note that probably won't be seen by anyone, but the Rising Crust pizza is actually labelled Spinach, Mushroom, and Garlic on the package. I know this because I had one about a week ago so I checked the box and the UPC matches with the one on the recall list
I stopped eating Lean Cuisine after the second time I found a big sharp piece of plastic in my food. Also around that time I realized Lean Cuisine tasted like salty wet cardboard. 
It's not delivery... it's a bloody asshole!
Polly, it cuts the roof of my mouth, its bad pizza.

I just bought a Digiornos last night, and just about kicked myself. Thankfully, not on this list.
Long live Supreme!
You are what you eat -- don't buy frozen entrees ever.  You can easily saut√© pre-prepped veggies, toss them in stir fry sauce, sear some marinated tofu and make yourself an amazing dish in 5 minutes and you don't even need to pierce a thing with a fork, fold an opened corner or stir contents then microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes or worry about fucking glass in your entree
Eat glass instead; it's more nutritious. 
It's not delivery, it's a trip to the ER
they combined it for you
Pour the beer on the pizza. If it holds, pizza is glass.
It's not delivery, it's glass.
I guess I'll just have to eat this Tortino's brand pizza rolls and wash them down with an ice cold Pepsi. Then I'll probably just stream some South Park on Hulu and have a Jack Daniel's and 7up.
Now with teeth shattering flavor bits!
"It's not delivery, it's DiWindow"
You mean it wasn't supposed to be shredding your bowels already?
That's Nestle for you 
It's not DiGiorno's, it's digestive tract failure.

I don't write ads for a reason.
I like the lasagna.
Confession time: when studying for the bar exam I used to take Toninto's pizza rolls and dip them in Stouffer's mac n cheese. I gain 20 lbs that summer and could barely fit in the biggest suit my sad ass owned in order to take the bar exam. I'm not even sorry. 
Can't really complain about some simple mac n' cheese
There was a fucking long hair in mine a couple of months ago. I'd almost have preferred glass.
... and glass.
Do you even still have a gall bladder?
I hope you took a picture because it sounds like they rushed someone over to grab all the evidence.
You bit into glass and you are unharmed, what compensation do you want? 
Had one last night... first in a long time. Shitty.
Did you die?
How could you eat one of those? I'd rather eat glass...
Nestle is hard to avoid, but may I make a different suggestion that might make it a little easier?

Avoid frozen, prepackaged crap.  Nestle doesn't sell veggies and raw meat.  As a bonus, you aren't eating frozen processed crap.
Sadly, it's almost all of the big ones. 
I had this realization when I ate a DiGiorno pizza yesterday, it was definitely a bummer. I think they own Red Baron too.
Nestle owns A LOT of the frozen pizza market
making lasagna is almost as easy as making spaghetti. Its totally worth it. 
Hey buddy, you gonna finish that scallop pizza??
Similar thing happened to me but with a finger in a box of cereal.  I haven't really trusted it since.
What do you want on your tombstone?
Eat glass, shred your intestines and bleed out your ass.

Nestl√® quality care.
They are so shitty and delicious.
I hear that. I used to eat TV dinners and frozen food all the time. Every morning a fucking Hot Pocket for breakfast. It really tastes like crap compared to anything you cook yourself with a stove and hot water. 
Apparently it came "from the spinach", which confuses me even more?
What the shit did I just watch? 
You got any spare ones you want to get rid of? I am asking for a friend.
Nestle chocolate
your argument is invalid
You probably weren't browsing news on the Internet 20 years ago either, so that might explain why you never saw these stories.
So it doesn't turn you into Popeye?
But seriously spinach is healthier than kale, but not magically so. The whole iron thing was a misplaced decimal. 

Iceberg and Romaine are just crunchy water though. 
I really could have used this evidence when I was a kid.  These days I actually like spinach. :(
There are rumors there is food in that.
As is my lasagna with meat sauce.
That stuff is so good for some reason
yea the link wouldn't load so once I found it I figured other people might have the same issue, I ate a pizza last night haha.

Are you now bleeding profusely from the mouth?
I stopped when I realized I was eating two at a time to feel full and it defeated the whole purpose.
Easier said then done. We all know what we COULD do instead.  Its actually having the time to do it that's the problem. 
That much is clear.
Why does glass always taste like blood? 
Less bioavailable sodium for sure. 
It's got electrolytes

The meat sauce lasagna is the tits. I will get the family size with 10 servings and eat it all. Can't shit for weeks afterwards.
It has enough sodium in it to stop my heart...but god do I love it
It used to be better. They changed the ingredients over the years, but it is still good.
The French Bread pizzas are pretty nice too.
Dude I get it.

My ex and I were together when she was studying for the bar. I mostly existed to bring her sandwiches and dick in between 12 hour marathon study sessions.

It's a tough life. She passed it the first time though, so props on her.
I've ordered mac and cheese at restaraunt before and gotten stouffers before. It's so recognizable. Really decent too, I like it more than kraft dinner.
A long hair is preferable to a short curly one. 
They've already admitted it has glass contamination. They're just trying to figure out which specific batches were affected and where in the production line the contamination is occurring.
I did... i have pictures of the box, the glass, the upc and have some documentation from the person who came by..... oh and the voicemail from the people over at nestle saying they are "taking this very seriously and would like to send someone out".... They were actually very nice about everything... Probably trying to avoid some sort of lawsuit. 
The cost of the pizza would be reasonable for their negligence.
Well, It luckily hit directly between two molars... didn't hit anything else.  I thought It was a piece of overcooked meat.... I'm embarrassed to say, but they are sending me a couple of coupons.... All the free glass I can eat.  I'm sure I could have plead PTSD or fake bleeding, but honestly after i picked out the glass... I finished my pizza.... I'm sure they thought I would try something like that, which is why they sent someone to my house right away.
Yep.  It gave me the same feeling of self loathing I get when I eat at a place like denny's, but without the convenience of having a waitress.
Seriously, they are the most expensive frozen pizzas, and they are one of the worst 
Organic frozen vegetables are great though. Unless it's spinach. Then it is probably made of glass.
[removed]
I'd love to cook more, but I don't have the time for it except on the weekends.
But my wallet...
Red Baron is owned by Schwans. Nestle owns tombstone, jacks, digiorno, and the rights to CPK. 
Source: I work for nestle. 
So true. 
meaning their supplier could have contaminated it. 
Look at the list of recalled products, it's pretty clearly spinach related, but how someone managed to contaminate spinach enough to impact that many products and not notice there was an issue is puzzling me though. I work in a food manufacturing facility, glass is a) not used in the first place wherever its possible to use something else b) if it does have glass it goes on a list and c) that list is regularly checked to make sure the glass isn't broken or missing
I am even more confused.
I used to go to the Spike and Mike animated film fests about ten years ago and the Happy Tree Friends were always a favorite.
Sorry, my boss ordered me to throw them out. They're currently in the dumpster.

No thats cancer 
Sounds like it just makes your organs bleed. 
I thought I read somewhere that romaine is actually healthier than spinach though
Yeah...the za and the mushroom mezzaluna ravioli are regulars for me. ;)
No. It wasn't one of the affected Production Codes. I do, however, have an unopened one that IS one of the affected production codes. I tried calling the Nestle support line like the page says but I was on hold long enough both times that it sent me to voicemail. 
You must be a big guy
Uhh it takes 5 minutes to make a stir fry meal ... If I can make it that quickly you can too -- hell I could probably make a pizza from scratch in under the amount of time to bake a frozen pizza ... Letting the dough rise would be the biggest time consumer as a fresh pizza only takes a few minutes to cook under high heat .. Give me 20 minutes to let the dough rise and 5 minutes to bake 
Just like the glass.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Because you use hobos herpies afflicted anal prolapse as a dinner plate?

For weeks? Now I know what to eat when I get diarrhea. 
Well if it makes you feel any better that's one of the one's they recalled. 

Source: Had to pull them from my counter
Yeah that shit is the best!
Those are great!  Except when you cannot wait and burn your mouth.
Man. I stupidly became single right around graduation so the only dick I had was purple and required batteries. I mean I **hated** my ex by that point, but surely I could've gotten him to come over once a week for sex and not talking me.
Pretty obviously the spinach supplier is at fault here. I'm not sure how you get that much glass in something to contaminate so many different products and get such a high complaint rate. Someone messed up big time. 
Hey, I like Denny's. Build your own grand slam is a solid, cheap food choice. No shame.
Yeah but I can't eat pizza even delivery any more without feeling bad about myself. Maybe I'll just do homemade. I think my time with pizza is over if that doesn't work.
Yeah really. Every time I mention they're not very good I get crapped on. Freschetta is a lot better. Some of the cheaper ones are better. Fuck, even Walmart store brand was decent.
For real. I always get Red Baron, Tombstones, or Jack's. Usually whatever is on sale at the Kroger.
Sure.  You can parse it to the Nth degree, but I'm simple, so I use the rule of "Was this manufactured or grown?"

You can't manufacture a pork chop, for example.  Yes, it can be slaughtered and butchered on an assembly line, but there isn't much beyond that done to it.

As a rule of thumb, if it comes pre made, pre cooked, canned, boxed, frozen, etc. you probably want to avoid it.

I believe its healthier, but I primarily do it because you can cook much better food than you can buy in a box or can, and it really isn't hard.  You can also save a lot of money.  For the ~$5 a stouffers lasagna would run you you could spend about $7-10 and make enough killer lasagna to eat for a week.  Saves money and is much tastier.

Thank you. I work in the food industry and cringe every time someone says "don't eat processed food".
Crock pot/slow cooker.

Make meals for the week on Sunday.
I don't either.  I usually just make a huge batch on Sundays.   There are also a lot of quick meals you can do like salad, nachos, fried eggs etc.
I'm not sure what you're getting at, it's cheaper too if you're doing it right.
I will say the people who work at their distribution center are good people, as a vendor to nestle. 
There's so many dumb ways that shit can get into food. A farm near where I live got in huge trouble because they shipped tomatoes in a truck and forgot to hose it down properly.
The Spinach is made out of glass, duh!
I'm Popeye the perforated man!
My grandfather used to make spinach (with potatoes and lamb) all the time when I was a kid and I loved spinach.

It was fresh spinach though, not the canned or frozen shit, and he was an excellent cook.

Like almost any food out there, if it's well prepared it tastes good. if it's not it tastes like crap.


Bluto was legit.  You at least saw him feasting on protein.
It was canned back then.
It's got lower glass levels for sure.
Eh, I'd say it's a bit less healthy looking at nutritional value.  Has a lot of Vitamin A, but so does spinach.  Fairly comparable to arugula in moth other vitamins.  Lower than either in protein or minerals like iron, calcium, or potassium though.

Kale is overall probably the best.  All that plus a ton of Vitamin C.
Can you post a picture? 
Cook that thing up and start your treasure hunt!
Nah.. those things are about 8-10oz each so a little over a pound of food for someone in their 20s who was 6' 210lbs and somewhat active regularly wasn't crazy.
YOU can, and good for you.  Other people are different. 
You need to consider prep time, cook time, and cleaning time all factor into this. Setting up a single day may work, but trying to say it only takes 5 minutes and fits into anyone's schedule is fairly naive.

Trying so very hard to be funny
Olive Garden?
Holy shit, I would be so embarrassed... But at the same time it would be hilarious.
Try heroin! 
Seriously, if you get diarrhea, the BRAT diet is what's recommended by healthcare professionals.

Bananas

Rice

Applesauce


Toast


I was going to buy some next week.  So sad. :(
Denny's is one of my favorite places to go after a night of drinking.
Have you tried a veggie pizza? I think it's the oil getting to you.


When I can, I like to get white sauce/banana pepper instead of the traditional red sauce/pepperoni/deluxe. It's still pizza but it's much easier the system as far as heartburn and I don't feel as bogged down unless I overeat.. tho that goes hand in hand with pizza.
I just started making homemade pizza.  It tastes just as good as my local pizza places and is a hell of a lot cheaper (less than $6 for a large).  I even like homemade crust better, it seems fresher.  I started with a basic cheese and pepperoni but yesterday I made a sausage, red pepper, and onion pizza.  
You weren't more specific, you just found a different way to say "processed" through the implication that "meat" is not really *'meat'*.
Good people, great people.
All for that extra crunch!
Sounds like you had a great childhood! 
Spinach is pretty high in protein.
I've been cooking for a few years, and have done it professionally .. But I still consider myself a novice.  I still have to read up on techniques ... But every lazy person I have lived with would never prepared their own meals ... They go out to grab a bite of fast food and by the time they return I'm done making some amazing tacos, burgers, fish cake, or quick Chinese dish and all they have is a value menu meal that took them 30 minutes to get at a cost of $12/lb ... 


I guess so :(
Sadly, that's 99% of reddit these days. Almost every comment is a complete waste of time.
Hahahaha sounds like a lot of OTC meds. 

Got a little cold? Take some meth. 
What about for drinks/liquid? 
You don't have to cite anything, but why are those foods recommended over others? 
Waffle House or bust
yeah,  if you find me in a Denny's,  your boy is either fucked up, depressed, or both. 
[removed]
that seems like a quick jump to conclusions, all he said was his grandpa cooked for him lol, maybe he didnt include the part where he beat the shit out of him for dessert
oh, ya but Popeye isn't shown eating 10 cans of it.
Again, congratulations and good for you but just because you choose not to prepare all your meals or eat lean cuisines does not make you lazy.
Judgmental much? I make 95% of my food by hand but I'm not going to be an asshole and call people who don't cook like me lazy. 
BRAT is actually no longer generally recommended but if I recall correctly, the reasons / information for BRAT is that they're bland foods that shouldn't irritate your stomach when consumed.  
  
Additionally: 
  
Bananas - High in Potassium and maybe a few other nutrients which is needed for cells to function.  Some say Diarrhea can cause low potassium levels.  
  
Rice - acts as a binding food which should help make your diarrhea not as liquid-y 
  
Applesauce - similar to what rice does  
  
Toast - Was told to not use Whole Grain but it's similar to what rice / applesauce does  

Edit: added the word "not" for Toast explanation. 
Waffle houses aren't everywhere... Seems like Denny's are.
I don't know what you're talking about, but if the ingredients say "ground beef", "ground pork", "ground pork, turkey, chicken" etc, the product is required to actually include it. It is indeed real meat. Is it tasty meat? No, it's shitty fatty cuts that have been pressure cooked and sat on a shelf for weeks or months. But it's still real meat.
Not saying he got hit ect.  Maybe home life sucked ass at home but grandpa's was heaven? Sounds amazing with the fresh cut produce ect.  

Growing up I've had the can stuff besides fruit and potatoes. Mom was never a culinary chef but it was good cooking.  

My wife and I discovered going that extra prep "most times not much time" besides LASAGNA night! That took forever but her and I got a smooth system down for prep and cook.  I think it's roughly hour and half now with prep and cook? 

Anyway I agree with the using of the fresh produce but I just op there had an awesome or at least a mediocre childhood. 
Not on screen.
ah, this is perfect. i know, of course, what the individual foods can provide nutritionally, but i wasn't sure how they all went together. binding foods/easy to stomach stuff now makes sense- even obvious.

cheers!

I was told there would be punch and pie.
The next version will be hard to name with "Q". Quince, Quesadilla... ummmm, QupQake?
I was trying to figure out how this wasn't going to get confused with the Raspberry Pi and Pi OS, when I realized that most people don't even think about Raspberry Pis as being a thing. 
And only 1% of users can actually use it. 
Quik. As in Nestle Quik. They partnered with Nestle on KitKat. 
I vote Quesadilla...
I vote Quesadilla...

Jim Gaffigan will be forever linked to Hot Pockets in my mind. I think that would make him happy. 
Edit: I would just like to say that the number of messages in my inbox regarding Hot Pockets is astounding. Keep it up!
Read this while eating a hot pocket, still finished it. 
So much for those those new "higher quality ingredients" they were advertising...
I only eat Hot Pockets when I'm drunk late at night and in the mood to feel sad and ashamed.

We call those Tuesdays.
I am extremely skeptical when I hear media reports of the USDA claiming that there were 'diseased and unsound animals'  - without any accompanying reports of sickness.   

Here's why:   We have a local meat processor that was just shut down for the same reasons.  'diseased and unsound animals'.   Turns out,  that's what they call it when they can't find the correct paperwork.   The meat they processed locally was inspected,  but the USDA inspectors on site used the wrong (older) paperwork and did not use the new forms.   Since they don't have the latest documentation on the meat they can't certify it as sound and so in the binary world of meat inspection,  it is either certified sound or it's 'unsound'.   Keep in mind,   this particular action is going to destroy a growing local economy of grass-fed organic humanely raised beef and pork,  since this is the last remaining meat processor within several hundred miles.   

I have zero sympathy for Nestle,  but I've learned to read news articles with great skepticism.   
Is the news the fact that Hot Pockets contain real animal products?
For the lazy:

I can confirm, I work in the Frozen Department for my Wal-Mart. Yesterday morning I took off a few of the large packs of Hot Pockets. I think they're the boxes that have like 30 or so in there. They're like $10 or something. Except, I wasn't told why to take them off, just to take them off. 

I also pulled 55 packages of frozen GV Hamburgers in the blue bag. Not sure if there's a correlation or just a coincidence. 
This is my complete and utter lack of surprise. 
Damn, I mean I knew that wasn't the strongest grade of meat in the world but still...
I literally just ate a hot pocket 30 minutes ago... one of the types said to have been pulled... I'm not sure if I feel ill because I may have eaten some zombie flesh, or because I had a hot pocket for dinner..
Please read this article.

http://www.biteclubeats.com/rancho-recall-the-end-of-sonoma-county-beef/

Rancho plant is located in Petaluma, CA, just up the road from me.  They are a small, family owned processing plant and it seems to me and many of the local ranchers that the FDA has it out for them - maybe wanting to eliminate this small plant that also processes the meat for all the local organic ranchers and farmers (one day a week).  There is SO much more to this story. 
Diseased and Unsound Animals is the name of my band!
Step 1: Open Hot Pocket.

Step 2: Insert into toilet.
"Symptoms include upset stomach, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping." 

How can you tell if you're experiencing symptoms or are just eating Hot Pockets?
Good thing I eat lean pockets and not hot pockets (I'm kind of a health nut).
In other news, Totinos pizza rolls stock expected to soar...
Oh man, why couldn't I have read this before dinner.
And I just finished eating one like an hour before seeing this. Yay.
Just...JUST scarfed down 2 hot pockets and then I saw this.
All this thread did was remind me I have a hot pocket in the freezer.  Now I will go make said hot pocket.
Diseased and unsound animals are their biggest customers.
I doubt that anyone eating hot pockets cares about the quality of food they're consuming.
First thought to hit my mind when I saw this was Jim Gaffigan saying "Hot Pockets" in all of his many voices.
Poisoning Hot-pockets is a direct attack on Redditors as much as would be poisoning of Bacon or cat food. This is conscience and deliberate act of War.  
[removed]
Hot pocket for breakfast, hot pocket for lunch, and you'll be dead by dinner.
SHIT! I just ate a Hot Pocket, so long cruel world...
If I die because of hot pockets I will come haunt thier asses 
just finished eating two of them 
Oh no, reddit's primary source of food is under threat
So far I have not seen an explaination of wtf "diseased" means.  This isn't a video game. What the fuck is the disease.  What is unsound? how does this happen.
*Looks down at half eaten hot pocket on plate.*
Is OP Jim Gaffigan?
Unsound animals?  What, like dogs that couldn't bark?
Where's Jim Gaffigan - he must be behind this.
Uhm, *SOME* hot pockets were pulled because they potentially had meat in them from a beef supplier that had recalled beef. 

This title is massively misleading. 
I eat Hot Pockets regularly, and this won't change that.  Of course, I don't usually eat the ones with beef in them so I've got that going for me.

I just don't understand the hate for a hot sandwich that costs $2/2 and takes 3:30 to make both of them.  I get the Jim Gaffigan bit, but you know better than to bite in to anything that comes out of the microwave, much less a HP.
Reddit. It has been nice knowing you :c

http://i.imgur.com/6IRbOJy.jpg
I'm reading this as I got one in the microwave -_-
I don't think anybody in this thread read anything but the title. Every upvoted comment is idiotic.
Lol I just bought some an hour ago before my local grocery closed and I ate two.  Only time will tell if I will spend the night on the toilet.

Update: it is 3 am here on the east coast, and my stomach is actually not feeling too well.  But I assume it's from soap residue in my protein shake.  Or it could just be the hot pocket (even regular hot pockets are... hot pockets).  Waiting to see if I fart blood.
Aren't we all a little diseased and unsound from time to time? 
If they pull ramen next, we've got thousands of student deaths to deal with.
I know multiple people who work at the plant where they make got pockets.  None of them have ANY  at their house and will not let their children eat them,  that was enough for me.   
Did someone tell /r/gaming?
Well, that's the end of Jim Gaffigan's career. 
So I'm a truck driver and I've pulled loads of Hot Pockets before from one of the main production facilities. I won't disclose which one but I remembered after a visit not too long ago being quite disgusted and filing an anonymous report with the county health inspector about 12 hours after I left.
I am reading this while eating a Hot Pocket. (&#9834; *Hot Pocket* &#9834;)
In other news, rising cases of skin cancer from neckbeards leaving their basement lairs to picket outside of Hot Pockets factory. Their skin was so white we needed welding goggles to interview them
I'm so sorry Jim Gaffigan. My prayers are with you.
I thought that was the whole point of a Hot Pocket.
Whenever i heard stories like this, it makes me shutter in disguise.

The government used our hard earn tax dollar to give out farming subsidies, then what did they do with it? to lobby against food inspection. 

Jesus frigging Christ, are the next quarter profit so important that farmers are willing to risk losing huge chunk of future revenue and potential public health hazard? 

Look, i don't care if food cost 2x or 4x as much. No amount of saving from cheap food is going to offset the potential health danger.

Seriously, if a farmer is receiving subsides, surprise inspection should be mandatory, NDA for farm worker/restaurant worker should be illegal and violation whistle blower should be protected and reward a bounty. And the inspector themselves should subject internal bribe entrapment to weed out any bad egg.
I thought I regretted not buying them 
no no no no no.  they used NON DISEASED MEAT from DISEASED animals!!!
Oh for fucks sake!! I just had one of those for the first time IN 6 YEARS last week!! 
I-I just ate one. . .Will I die?
I wonder how this would affect the proposed bill that would make it illegal to document such atrocities. 
I quit eating that shit a long time ago.
Oh man.

I just ate two *Lean* Pockets. Close call, carry on everyone.
Oh man, this just reminds me of how much I'm looking forward to seeing Jim Gaffigan's act in person next month. Hot Pocket!
Jim Gaffigan is about to have a field day. 
Wait... that stuff is meat? I thought it was ground up rubber erasers. 
That will teach me to laugh at the UK and their horse lasagna...
They shouldn't have done that, they'll ruin the dynamic of the original hot pocket taste. unsound animals is where the amazing flavor comes from.
Stoners from across the land are going to be horrified..
OP, the roof of my mouth thanks you.
So those are the cold parts in my hot pocket...
I thought that's par for the course for industrial meat.
But lean pockets are still legit right?
Unsafe meat?

What about the LAVA?
but thats what gives them their diseased and unsound flavor
Haven't eaten those in years. 

No matter what kind of microwave you have or tricks you use there will always be one frozen part and and a part hot enough to burn you.

They aren't that great anyway.

The product itself isn't the issue but the way meat is processed.
Were they referring to the contents of the Hot Pockets, or the average person that enjoys them?
take out of package, place directly in toilet
Breaking: Hot Pockets standard ingredients revealed!
I want to clear up a misconception about the ~~Wha-Cha-Ma-Carcass Sandwich~~ Hot Pockets. I used non-diseased meat from diseased animals! Everyone does it!


I got food poisoning from eating one of these the other week, the philly cheesesteak croissant, i am pretty sure i still have the box and other pocket in my freezer still. I am definitely going to look and check the batch number if i still have it.
You don't want to know where the meat for Lean-Pockets comes from...
In any case, at $1 a box in Kroger, it was pretty much the only hot snack I could afford when I was in college.
I remember that commercial "new and premium beef" or something.

Did nobody else go, "wtf did they use before?"
So does this mean half of reddit is going to be missing for the next week due to food poisoning?
Nestl√© is disgusting, stop eating their "food."
Hot Pockets: You didn't think that was meat, did you?
Hot pockets contain meat of some sort? TIL
Nestle products (such as Hot Pockets) are such shit.

Always make sure to read the back of a new item you are about to purchase at the store. Make sure the company/brand isn't owned by Nestle.

Nestle is the mark of shit.

Case-in-point: Digorno pizza used to be great! They were really good for a frozen pizza. Nestle came in and did the thing they do, and now they taste like absolute garbage, an their about 40% smaller.

Stay away from all things Nestle.
"Diseased Pockets!" - Jim Gaffigan can add that to his bit.
I guess Jim Gaffigan was right on when he called them diarrhea pockets.
[deleted]
>had not undergone proper inspection

>could have come from ‚Äúdiseased and unsound animals,‚Äù

>"COULD"

In other words, somebody forgot to fill out the check sheet for a batch of Hot Pockets, and there COULD be something wrong.
This belongs in [/r/nottheonion](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/).
[HOT POCKET!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-i9GXbptog)
Ive said it once Ill say it again Nestle is one of the most evil corporations facing the human race - anyone seeking to privatize the water supply of nation states and third world countries is evil as fuck.  


People eat hot pockets? Real people I mean, not children?
If you eat manufactured food, you get what you get. 
Could a libertarian please explain why testing this product and pulling it from sale is evil?
I'm not surprised. One more reason my lazy ass has to cook my own food.
I have four boxes I need to throw away now :/
Aww man there's a joke here somewhere.   Damnit!
They were then donated to an area animal shelter, where they were eaten by diseased and unsound animals.
The microwave will now be known as the popcorn maker.
Thankfully for my health they stopped making croissant pockets a while back.
That quote was made up by the story.. its not what happened
Always and only Four Cheese, my dudes.
Do you think the people that eat hot pockets actually care what is in them..? 
Good, it's the Philly Steak and Cheese ones. I don't like those. I eat Hot Pockets all the time and I got a little worried for a minute.
Well this helps explains the diarrhea
"do you think my animals are unsound?"

"I don't see any animals..."
I had a ham and cheese hot pocket a few days ago. gag reflex gag reflex. I might hurl.
Phew, all I have are the pizza flavored ones and they're from 2013. I'm safe.

Kinda.
As long as they didn't mention the god tier pepperoni pockets, than crisis averted. I don't even eat those shitty kinds they put
Word to mother I was never so scared to eat a Hot Pocket until I read the article, only the nasty Philly Cheese steak variety is affected. 
Meh, I'd still eat'em.  The best food I had in Mexico came from diseased and unsound animals.  Nothing like a good street taco vendor that also keeps the wild dog populations down.
Thank good I only eat the pepperoni pizza hot pockets.  Ham and cheese if its before 12pm... Cause I'm not an animal.
Who eats hot pockets?  I don't understand how these things still exist.  I remember thinking they looked good when I was a kid.  We got some, and it turns out they're completely disgusting.  

I'm all for convenience, but there are things that are just as convenient, but not quite so shitty.

Oh, they also have wood in them, but that's just a normal ingredient for cheap food like this.
This is why I haven't eaten beef in two years
I mainly eat the pepperoni and sometimes sausage ones. I think I'm safe.
Shit, where did the meat from my pepperonis come from then?
I think this would be better if it was titled "Hot Pockets pulled from shelves for containing Hot Pockets"
I was so paranoid eating that Hot Pocket tonight, then I see this.

Shoulda had the Triscuits.
Donkey Pockets?
And in other news, water is wet and fire is hot
Take out of box, place directly in toilette.
How is that different from the people eating them?
Well for what it's worth, they have about half as much filling as they did ten years ago. So you only ate half as much "meat".
For the Canadians:  We're talking about the shitty US hot pockets, which are nothing at all like McCain's Pizza Pockets that you buy in Canada.
funny i got a call from stop and shop o whoever i bought them from and they warned me about this, goodthing the philly cheesesteak box was the one unopened still in my freezer. theyre probably fine anyway, i was wondering if i should still eat them anyway
Hot pockets are full of mystery meat?  I'm shocked.

Wow, what are the chances.. I ate my first hot pocket in over 3 years today for lunch.
Apparently big government knows nothing about flavor.
So that's why so many people have been getting extras
Is that like, not the entire point?
[Looks like it's mostly isolated to California](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/0871ce45-1c81-4af8-99c5-e0d0d60216c5/RC-013-2014-Retail-List.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=0871ce45-1c81-4af8-99c5-e0d0d60216c5)
WTF does "unsound" mean when you have to differentiate that from "diseased"?
does this also pertain to lean pockets cause i just bought a 12 pack of dem shits
So naturally the rest of the hot pockets will be on sale. BRB
Ranch Feeding Corporation is in my town. They just got shut down...was wondering why...eww.
Just going to set this hot pocket down...

And throw up in the sink...
...

I had a Hot Pocket for lunch...

Excuse me while I induce vomiting.
Great, now I want a Hot Pocket.  
As someone who has eaten a few of these, the inside "filling" makes me want to throw up every time I see it. 
Hot Pockets, now in new Pus flavor!
Soon this will be revealed to be common practice for all 'processed' meats including pepporoni, sausage, and especially 'pizza rolls' in the usa and probably most countries. 

There is no profit in pulling diseased animals and contaminated food from the production line so why would a capitalist do it?  
Well seeing as how hot pockets reach the temperature of the sun when heated for long enough should mean that all diseases inside are obliterated. Just like your mouth when you bite into one too quickly. 
There was a guy in a thread somewhere bragging about fucking hot pockets.  I wonder if a Hot Pocket ever gave him an STD and him not know it.  He should probably get tested.
i'll have to step away from my bong now for a bit now!wtf
And yet, somehow I still want one.... hooooooottttt pockets!
'diseased and unsound animals'

isn't that their target market?
Wait, I thought "may contain portions of diseased and unsound animals" was already on the ingredients list. Oh well, even with the potential diseased meat, it's still healthier for you than potted meat food product.
The meat came from Petaluma ca, where I live. Called Rancho or something like that, a dirty little slaughter house. Apparently the meat was not inspected‚Ä¶That is all‚Ä¶.P-E-T-A-L-U-M-A!!!!
This is not the news I wanted to hear today....
gotta love Nestle, juggernaut _'food'_ manufacturer.

never mind what unsavoury muck in the products, enjoy the commercials, eat the dream.

one hint of how bad basic ingredients are in some mass produced foods, years ago one company was caught reselling salvage fats and grease from London sewers into the food chain, sending it to livestock food producers.

it was only meant to be turned into fuel oils, but after some basic filtering, it went into cattle-cakes (cow kibble).
Lol those things are fucking disgusting anyways.

You kind of deserve some misfortune if you actually eat them, hopefully that'll motivate you to eat actual real food.
Jim Gaffi...oh. I see we went there. ^^slowly ^^backs ^^out ^^of ^^doorway.
It's as if millions of geeks suddenly cried out in horror. And then they were still. 
The first time I ate hot pockets, I was thinking "People eat these.  I will eat these."

I retched them up within an hour.

Granted, I was drunk - but I still blame the hot pockets for the retching.  I'm pretty sure they've always contained things that would make you die.
Good thing I only eat those LEAN pockets!  Ha ha hahaha hah ahhhh... ahhhhh.. ehhhhhhhh..... uhhhh...  fuck.
if anybody remenbers, Mike Rowe and his TV series 'Dirty Jobs',

anyway one of his shows he was at one small cow rendering company, they took a cow skinned it and then put the whole carcass including spinal column and head including brains into a giant grinder, end result was a mush that got made into cow kibble.

recycling cow nerve tissue was partly what caused the BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis) outbreak in the UK in the 90s. another possible contributing cause was animal renderers disposing of their liquid waste down boreholes into the water table.

ie 'Mad Cow Disease'

WARNING, YOU JUST BOUGHT HOT POCKETS!
Hope you're drunk or headed home to a trailer! You hillbilly enjoy the next NASCAR event.
Just Try and come back from this PR disaster!
But don't worry these meat companies will regulate themselves /sarcasm
Over in United states of Europe we have scandals now and then with meat being handled badly. Seems like it's a food that's hard to manage. My vegetarian friends tell me they're very relieved whenever they read about these kinds of stuff happening... 
If I'm understanding this correctly, the FDA isn't saying that all of the beef is diseased or unsound. It seems to be saying that the reason for the recall is because the beef was not inspected, and therefore *might* be diseased or unsound.
I have free hot pockets in the freezer at work, pizza of course. I won't be back to check batch numbers for almost a week. Am I gunna die?

I mean I know I'm gunna die from eating Hot Pockets, but am I gunna die right now? 
Thank you, I was looking all over for some actual info. This post needs removed.
Thank you for this. I'm safe to eat Hot Pockets.
You really got to the meat of the story, didn't you?
If it affects products with "best by" dates from March 2014 to October 2014, doesn't it mean this has been going on for a while now?  

If an October '14 product was manufactured yesterday, then a March '14 product was made as early as July '13... 
Does this affect use of hotpockets as fleshlights, if so which flavors?
A sensationalist title and a link to an short, easy to read "article" is what gets upvoted on /r/news. Your news source looks too much like real information. The game is to get people to notice, not actually warn them of anything like what you did.
Whats funny is in my area there were a lot of recalls, but all at the really shady grocery stores and gas stations.
I have a friend who worked an event that featured Jim Gaffigan as a guest speaker. One guy in the crowd kept yelling "HOT POCKETS" incessantly till it started detracting from what was going on stage. Jim Gaffigan then turned to the crowd and explained how he both loves and loathes the Hot Pockets bit, because although he more or less owes his entire stardom to that one bit, he hates how obnoxious it's become and how it's the only thing people remember him for.
"Hoooot pockets"

Nestle also recently announced it was recalling Hot Pocket Philly Steak and Cheese sandwich 12-count and two-count boxes, as well as Hot Pocket Philly Steak and Cheese croissant sandwiches.

The Rancho recall also includes 30-pound boxes of the Western bar delicacy known as Rocky Mountain oysters, or fried, breaded bull testicles.

The boxes are frequently broken up and sold in smaller amounts.

Word of the recall hadn‚Äôt reached Rock Creek Lodge in Clinton, home of the **Rocky Mountain Testicle Festival.**

If I am going to buy and eat a hot pocket I don't think it matters a whole lot to me what substandard additive is in my food. As long as there isn't bones or fingers I'm eating it. 
Well, if these were high quality ingredients, you've got to wonder what the used before...
Hot Pockets use only the finest cuts of rat meat.
are lean pockets ok

they lifted the sick animals a few inches highter before they dropped them onto the factory ground

But that.... That's today!
I call those days that end with the letter "Y" 
especially when the article that is linked says, "We don't know what an unsound animal is, but we're pretty sure we don't want to eat one."

Like, isn't that your job as a source for news to find out what an "unsound" animal might be? You're only time.com!


Maybe I'm crazy, but I would rather they err on the side of caution when it comes to food safety. Let's not forget that thousands of babies got sick and some died from contaminated milk products in China only a few years ago. I would rather they assume the meat is bad than assume it's safe at the risk of spreading food borne illnesses.
[deleted]
For anybody interested,  the 'paperwork'  involved is called HACCP certification,  [Here's a link](http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-24-W.pdf) to the particulars.   The verification process is what's killing the small processing plants.  


Bigfoot is hotpockets.
I am Jack's complete and utter lack of surprise.
I would have thought that being cooked, freezedried, frozen and then nuked that it would kill virtually anything that was living in it. That makes me wonder if they are safe to eat.
the meat was not confirmed contaminated, just not inspected.
I lived near that placed for a few years, never saw any cows. Was surprised to hear they slaughtered animals there. It looks so dumpy...
Damn, how have I missed the plant is in Petaluma through all this? I grew up in Petaluma and currently live in Rohnert Park...I guess I need to pay more attention to local news.
> She also clarifies that the meat in question wasn‚Äôt hamburger or steaks, but offal and carcasses.


Mmmmm, hot pocket carcass flavor!
It's the USDA, not FDA. Very different entities with very different inspection regulations and authorities. I don't know the details of the recall so I can't comment on the assumptions made in the article. But I really can't make any sense of that article because it's all over the place. Either way, I tend to think the USDA is supposed to prevent people from getting sick and not just wait until a five year old is in the hospital getting kidney transplants because she ate a burger.
Fuck, this article makes me mad.

It claims that no diseased meat was found. Alright.

Then why does the [USDA release](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2014/recall-013-2014-release) say that:

> [Rancho Corporation] processed diseased and unsound animals **and** carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection.

I'm more inclined to believe the USDA inspectors than a bunch of disgruntled businessmen that stand to profit from selling the recalled meat. The article did not make a good argument, and the slaughterhouse looks like an unclean, dilapidated dump.

Not everything is a fucking government conspiracy or shake-down.
nobody from your band has ever been inside a hot pocket.
You consider yourself a health nut, but you eat processed frozen food put out by Nestle?
Jokes on you. They just put the diseased hot pockets in a lean pockets box.
Are you one of Jimmy Fallon's new writers?
For some reason I got it into my head that those would be good. But then I started eating them and realized I had made a terrible mistake.
It's true.

downers, ie cattle or other animals that cannot walk due to some nasty disease, or dead and rotting, or infested with parasites.

these can be legally use for pet foods, but only after prolonged boiling/sterilisation.
I prefer the term: alternative meat.
Agreed, the Philly steak is good, eating one as we speak !
OH shit! Well I guess that's it then. :(
>Look, i don't care if food cost 2x or 4x as much

You may not, but everyone else does. All three of my local grocery stores stopped carrying local, grass-fed beef because it was too expensive and nobody wanted it. The fact that I bought it every week didn't seem to change their mind. You're blaming the government for all of this and not considering how much the consumer factors in to how shitty our food is.
In disguise?
>farming subsidies used to lobby against regulation

Oh god...this means there is a great possibility that all industries are using subsidies as a way to fund lobbying efforts for lax regulation in the US. This type of funding practice to lobbyists ought to be illegal.
Fyi where that mean comes from is hardly a farm. It's more of a factory.
>  are the next quarter profit so important that farmers are willing to risk losing huge chunk of future revenue and potential public health hazard? 

Yes.  Obviously.  Because the last 4,000 times they did it, they didn't get caught.

Ranch is required by law to have an FDA inspector onsite when meat is being processed. An entire YEARS worth of meat is being recalled.  How is this possible?  Chances are the FDA blew it big time, either lost the paperwork, or failed to fill it out properly, and are now passing the buck down to Rancho.  
Nestle is the owner of Hot Pockets brand.


In Solon, Ohio, Nestle USA, Inc. and approved affiliates expect to create 250 full-time positions, generating $21.8 million in additional annual payroll, as a result of the company‚Äôs new location project in Cuyahoga County. Nestle produces food based on nutrition, health and wellness needs. The TCA approved a 65 percent, 10-year Job Creation Tax Credit for this project http://www.areadevelopment.com/newsItems/10-29-2013/ohio-tax-credit-authority-assists-10-firms248932.shtml 


The Job Creation Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit to companies generally creating at least 10 new jobs (within three years) with a minimum annual payroll of $660,000 that pay at least 150percent of the federal minimum wage. The tax credit is measured as a percentage of the state income tax withholdings for all new employees hired under the program, and is applied toward the company‚Äôs commercial activity tax liability. Should the amount of the credit exceed the company‚Äôs commercial activity tax liability for any given year, the difference is refunded. A business must apply for the credit before committing to the project. Applicants must be approved through the Ohio Tax Credit Authority before hiring begins. http://jobs-ohio.com/funding/ 


So I think Nestle gets to keep 65% of employee state tax withholdings for themselves. 


Holy shit... 21.8 million divided by 250 is about 85k. Nestle is bringing 250x 85k per year jobs to Solon, Ohio. At a cost of 430k lost to state revenue. 


I rounded a lot of numbers but still this seems to good to be true. Can someone from Solon, Ohio working for Nestle confirm their 85k salary?

America has the cheapest, safest food in the world. The fact that they issued a recall means they are doing the right thing by reacting to the situation. If this meat went through a slaughtering plant it was inspected. It's naive to think no diseased meat will ever slip through the cracks during inspection. Inspectors are humans and humans make mistakes.
Believe it or not, Hot Pockets are not made by farmers.
Diarrhea Pocket!
At least microwave it first, it'll flush easier.
Kind of like a Hot Pocket
If the store you got them from [isn't on the list](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/0871ce45-1c81-4af8-99c5-e0d0d60216c5/RC-013-2014-Retail-List.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=0871ce45-1c81-4af8-99c5-e0d0d60216c5), it's not being recalled.
Fresh, wild-caught, critically endangered pepperons.
And only the Philly Cheese Steak variety in certain stores. 

So if you're eating that flavor, be warned that there's a *chance* that the food *might* have a *possibility* of being made from *potentially* diseased meat, which *may or may not* carry heath risks.

The fact that 1 of the 12 Hot Pockets in my freezer contains 45 percent of my daily allowance of saturated fat is way more distressing.

ITT: A whole lot of people looking for any excuse not to throw out their hot pockets.
Yeah. Typical Reddit. Misleading title and "article." 
Nothing would be able to survive scalding lava pockets either way. 
It seems more likely to me that they did a late inspection and caught them processing some diseased/unsound animals, which might mean that they had  been doing so earlier, leading to it possibly being sold in stores.

None of which probably matters, since I would imagine any viruses or bacteria in hot pockets are killed during cooking, or so I assume.
[Rancho Feeding Corporation, a Petaluma, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 8,742,700 pounds, because it processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection. Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2014/recall-013-2014-update-021814)

Rancho is a vendor for Nestl√©'s (the Hot Pocket manufacturer), and that's why Hot Pockets were recalled. From this USDA press release it doesn't sound like its a question. It sounds like the meat was definitively diseased. The question for Nestl√© is that they don't know if they got some of the bad meat or not. So they recalled their Hot Pockets.  

IMO, you should just throw them anyway. It's pure garbage and they don't even taste good. So why risk it? Just trash it. 
Funnier here, I'm in Eugene Oregon, and the only recall locale is the supposedly high end butcher in the more effluent south side of town.

That sounds like common sense,  right?  But the devil is in the details.   I was reading some food safety industry articles,  and the problem with this 'verification'  process is that it puts a much larger burden of proof on the small producers than it does the large commercial meat packers.   The reports are saying that the proof that's being required is highly arbitrary,  it's not evenly applied and that the training and information on HACCP is ambigious and limited in scope.   This makes it difficult for both the regulator and the business owner.   Keep in mind this meat was *inspected* by the USDA.  They found nothing.  The only thing they did not find was the paperwork to support the verification step.   This meat was safe by all other measurements.  
I believe that for every adjective they add to the name there will be an accompanying 10% markup. 

This pork is free-range, hormone free, grass-fed, organic, humanely raised, free trade meat.

So do you not understand that people *already pay these prices via taxes that provide the subsidies?* It's just that the excess costs are hidden from you? 
People lack a reference for understanding how poor sanitation and food safety was in the past, same goes for outbreaks of disease and illnesses.

> pay at least 150percent of the federal minimum wage

Where did you get $85k?  This is closer to $24k/ea employee.

Also, IBM is notorious for getting these deals and not actually creating the number of promised jobs. They then say "they market went south, so we didn't hire" and when the tax credit ends, they move the whole data center elsewhere to a new community who is willing to pay them to come in.  IBM is a master at this and usually gets taxpayer funded buildings out of the deal on top of the low/no state tax thing.

It would be nice if states would all get together and agree to quit doing these things.


Not 85K yet, but close.
> And only the Philly Cheese Steak variety

I haven't bought a hot pocket in *decades*.

Just bought one today. See if you can guess which one I bought.

Off to check a batch number.

*edit: upc matches, batch number does not, and expiration is mar 2015, so it looks 'safe'?*
I'd be more worried about the sodium, personally.
Forgive me if I am wrong (as I am not a biologist by any means, and have only just read the chapter on fats in my Bio 1 course), but I believe that saturated (which just means they contain as much hydrogen as possible) fats are about as healthy as unsaturated (has one or more double bonds between carbons, decreasing the number of hydrogen atoms below the max) fats, but healthier for you than trans (the molecules don't line up in a proper way: will need to look up on computer for actual description/link) fats.
> The USDA announced that the company was recalling the meat because Rancho Feeding Corp. had ‚Äúprocessed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspections,‚Äù the release stated.

That sounds pretty clear-cut to me.
Isn't that the standard here anyway? 
Thank you!!! The fact the I had to come this far down to find a sane comment somewhat disturbs me.

This is a great examaple of why you can't always trust the top comments on reddit.
And that quote is written by a random blogger, not by the FDA, not by Rancho Feeding Corp, not by anyone with any authority.  Just a random blogger trying to get in more page views and ad clicks.  

Rancho bypassed FDA inspections for some beef, the FDA found out and mandated the recall.  The FDA claim that since the beef was never inspected by the FDA for potential disease or being "unsound" it is naturally all then diseased and unsound until proven otherwise.  

This is a tactic used by the FDA to help enforce its regulations by putting a huge black mark on Rancho's public record which arguably will have a larger financial impact than any sort of recall or fine ever could.  

There has been zero proof of diseased meat, there has been zero reported cases of human illness from consuming the meat, this is mostly just FDA regulatory stuff.   There is the very real possibility the meat is 100% fine, there is also the potential its literally a writhing blob of infection we are calling "meat".  Seeing as how there has been no reports of illness and as that the people consuming the meat haven't flipped out about puss nodules I'm inclined to side with the not diseased (or mostly not diseased).  
No kidding.

I mean, this was a level 1 USDA alert... meaning that:

> This is a health hazard situation where there is **a reasonable probability** that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death

You can read report from the USDA [on their website, here.](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2014/recall-013-2014-release)

Note that it's in a lot more than hot-pockets, and that the meat was both diseased and not properly inspected...

Which is **very different** than the meat being uninspected and therefore potentially diseased. That's a level 2 alert.

Fucking redditors...
don't even throw out the wrapper. You know you'll be digging it out of the trash to check the microwave time, you filthy dogs.
This is probably exactly what happened. However, if the cow has mad cow disease, cooking doesn't kill that. They might have been processing downer cows (aka possibly diseased and definitely unsound) which are prohibited because they pose a risk of introducing mad cow into the food chain. But producers very often try to get them slaughtered after hours as "custom exempt," which is still not allowed for downer cattle.
Who the fuck goes to a comedy show and *makes requests*? A song is good a hundred times, but a joke? Two or three times at best and it's stale.
I think it had more to do with creative control, and a realization that some people were laughing *at*, and not *with* him. At least not in a way in which he was comfortable.

Of course it is. No company is in the business to lose money. Every change they make is driven by money. It is possible, however that a company might be driving sales by improving quality, or they might be cutting variable costs through cheaper ingredients as you said.

Actually, they take everything out that does taste somewhat unlike complete shit, and leave the complete shit in there for texture to accompany the taste of hydrogenated salt oil. That's been my experience anyways. 
From what I gather from your post history you don't work in the industry. Verification is simply not that hard. At all. You're talking about a place that sold grass-fed beef. So that means that they likely aren't cooking, don't have smoke houses, etc. So what we're saying is that they likely have 2 or less CCPs (the things that HACCP determines), and they still couldn't prove that they followed through and that it was the right step to prevent contamination. If they wrote the plan and aren't following it then it is their fault, AND the food is likely not as safe as it could have been. Verification is quite simple - prove that you're doing what you said you were going to do, show that it is working, and justify it (this will be alongside your HACCP plan and you use research documents to justify your limits on cooling, for example). 

It puts more burden on small businesses as opposed to large corporations because small businesses often try to go it alone, without a Quality/Food Safety specialized employee (like myself). The owner tries to run the program, but they don't have the educational back history for it. Those of us that go to college for this stuff understand HACCP like the back of our hand, along with a lot of other certification processes (SQF, BRC). I get that it is a financial burden to hire someone for this stuff. But, all these people who start idealized companies with "I just want to process my delicious sausages" back stories bitch when they hit USDA flack but it's because they entered into a complex business with sub-par safety standards. You can't run a meat processing company like it is your kitchen. Your kitchen isn't up to standards. I can guarantee you that grass-fed beef place had a bunch of other food safety violations - probably both for the facility and for paperwork. You DO NOT get shut down for one incidence. (Unless the shut down was actually driven by the owner in the idea that the loss of product allowed him to no longer be open.)

 If the processor didn't do their paperwork it is their own fault, not the fault of the inspector. The reason the meat IS NOT safe is because there is no proof. Should we just take Mr. Smith's, the owner, word for it? How do you know the "meat was safe by all other measurements"? You have literally no way of knowing because they can't prove that anything took place. Without proof the action never happened. It's sloppy food safety. And if the company was being lax enough on what was likely a CCP then I don't want to see what the rest of their facility looks like.

Food safety is a culture, and unfortunately a lot of small processors fail to instill that culture in their workplace simply because it "seems unnecessary" or "excessive" to them. Some do a great job at it, but far too many think that the basics of 30 years ago is sufficient. It's not.

Also, while I'm here. Meat is not bad for you unless it's processed or overcooked, there's no such thing as spot reduction in weight loss, you cannot get a cold from being cold. Eggs are not bad for you. Cholesterol in food is unrelated to serum cholesterol. Serum cholesterol is not even statistically correlated to heart disease. It's about HDL/LDL.
My primary concern is whether the next bite will be lava or icicle. 
Pussy. You don't want to be retaining water like a dam from eating something the size of a cellphone? 
The problem is that cholesterol hasn't actually been linked positively to health disease. 

edit: heart disease
I think benjamin might be a Rancho Corp. shill.
I read the comments first, almost always. If people are stoked in the comments, I'll read the article. If the first comment is calling the article bullshit and so are the ones below it, I'll take their word and not bother wasting my time on this "blog shit." So much sensationalist crap nowadays, the comments help filter it... and make me chuckle 6/10! 
Not really. The standard seems to be; top comment reveals the truth of the article. The next few complain that no one reads it (or that this is a repost, if applicable). Then someone says something about "the hivemend." There are lots of upvotes and then, if you scroll a bit past the obligatory pun thread, you find the actual discussion.
Turds do. And I usually agree, but there are a few comedian's albums I can listen to over and over. If mp3s deteriorated, my copy of Wyatt Cynac's Comedy Person would be digital dust.
It's what ran Chappelle away for awhile. All the idiots yelling "I'M RICK JAMES BITCH!" These were people who had never even seen his standups like Killing Them Softly, they just watched his show and remembered the most quoted bits of his career, and then go to his shows and yell shit like that.
At one point during his live comedy show Demetri Martin specifically asked if anyone had any joke requests.
Don't hide that under a bushel basket!
Hooooof Pockets
Equestrian pockets.
Ew... get your hand out of there.
We'd be so lucky. 
Remove from package and place directly in toilet bowl.

did i eat it or rub it on my face?
I don't know anyone over the age of 18 who has done this.
Most of the time, it's the same one.

Also the ingredient in most "Now with Fiber!" food products.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar. Lord knows what they charged. It was beautiful. We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.

Hot pocket board meeting-

Boss: We need a new hot pocket flavor. What's something people like?

Person A: well according to the internet, people like cats...

Boss: great! Put them in hot pockets.
Poop bacteria is actually pretty clean. It's just usually found in poop.
But I always drink plenty of..
 "malk"?
Can confirm, truth spoken here.
Thanks. And, it's not a big deal, but... can you coil that spaghetti back up just a bit? *it's showing*
If I were your doctor, I'd say yes, to avoid liability issues.

As a guy on the internet, I'd just say *ew*.
Call the store you got them from. If they were recalled from there, you should get a refund and trash them.
You are removing them from the bag, right?

Seriously, pizza rolls from the toaster oven are worth it.

Sometimes, the word is spelled wright, butt its knot the correct word fore that context. Google can't really help that weigh. 
OP died.
Why is meat bad if it is overcooked?
How does that relate to the previous comment about saturated fats? Cholesterol is neither a saturated nor unsaturated fat. It's a steroid (not in the muscle-building sense, but in the broader chemistry definition)
Well, let's recap:

HaiKarate posts easily-debunked nonsense, gets 400+ upvotes. hayesgm provides the relevant quote from the article which disproves original claim from HaiKarate, receives only 20+ upvotes.

I see this all the time here.

The story has been told, and the lie got more visibility through more upvotes.

Whether HaiKarate is a shill or not, he/she has effectively done the job of a shill.

Reddit should be wary of this shit, but my experience is that anyone who even uses the word "shill" (even though we know there are shills being paid to post on social bookmarking sites) gets downvoted no matter what.
I have the same technique. I'm not as smart as some that comment, so I often find myself get sucked into the article, only to read a comment explaining in detail why it's bullshit (especially in /r/science).

Ah, J√∂rmungandr makes more sense now
Isn't this entire thread like the exact opposite of /r/hailcorporate material? Do you even know what goes on in that subreddit?
meat flavored ~~food~~ product

why take on the liability and have to follow all those guidelines?

With electrolytes.
food-ish
I have seen Potted Meat Product, in a can a little smaller than a cat food can. 

It did not appear to be cat or dog food. I have forgotten or repressed the rest, aside from the fact that we left it on the shelf where we found it.
According to [this](http://ktla.com/2014/02/18/nestle-foods-recalls-some-hot-pockets-sandwiches/), the ones I have are the regular kind and aren't on the list, so I think it's fine....
He could quit but only if he could quit you.
Some of us do it for fun.
Ah, that's probably what the disguise is for.
Maybe he's talking about carcinogens from burnt or charred meat .
potentially cancer from charred stuff.. that's the only things I can tell he's good at
Sounds pretty darn smart to me . . . .

wait, seriously?  That's a thing?
It takes a smart man to realize he's dumb.  Of course I say this knowing full well how stupid I am.
