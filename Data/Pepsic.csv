My favorite parts:

>"A lot of other people were thinking [my mom] was smoking marijuana and drinking Pepsi," she tells NPR. 

Also:

>She's asked her mom, who also gave birth to daughters Robin and Kimberly, many times about how she got her name. 

What the fuck mom
If my name was Marijuana Pepsi I'd probably write a doctoral thesis trying to understand why too.
“Damn right!” - Reverend Cocaine Blowjob
So "Marijuana Pepsi" is a black cultural name, huh?
>Vandyck thinks her white teachers simply found her name unusual. Even though she preferred her full name, some teachers would call her Mary.

>"I think they wanted to make me feel more comfortable," she says. "They could see what the other children were doing, and they were trying to smooth the way and make things easier for me."

>But she says one of her research participants at Cardinal Stritch University in Milwaukee had another theory: "White people like things standardized, and that includes names."


No... no, hun. Your first name is a drug. That's why everyone under the sun - except you and your mom - think it's weird. It's not a white vs black thing. Why is this being framed as a black vs white thing. Fucking ridiculous.

Beats Dr Permanent Chip On Her Shoulder
I listened to their interview with her Friday (I think, days blend together). Interesting perspectives on names and identity. Good for her for succeeding when plenty of people would assume she can't because of her name.
Did adding Vandyck make her husband happy?
I went to college with a girl who named her first child Mai Tai, she told me, after what she had been drinking the night she met the baby's father.

How, um, romantic?

The fact she wrote her "thesis" on this topic is hilarious. What pseudo college accepted that garbage so I know to discredit them from now on?
[removed]
its going to effect her income and patient retention. she should change it for her family's financial sake.
Is this like a boy named Sue?
To me she is a joke nothing more nothing less...if she came to me for an interview she would not get through the door with a name like that.
I hope she specializes in MMJ referals.
We live in a day an age where people think someone's socially constructed, chosen by someone else's name should in anyway matter.

If she had been named plant soda, No one would give a shit.

Tbf tho, I can see where anger comes from, but she's not going to be inhibited at this point and all discussion boils down to:

Name hold back, she bad because name.

&

No, name no matter, we all people. Weed is plant.
Hi, I'm Kimberly and these are my sisters Robin and Marijuana Pepsi... uhh you can call her Mary.
"I demand an inquiry!" - Senator Crackpipe Dr. Pepper.
Seconded by Hitler McNazi and Bob Babyrapist.
I didn’t read the article and went straight to the comments. I honestly thought this person was white with hippie parents lol
Don’t blame white people, blame yo momma!
Marijuana (Mary-Jane in Spanish) has been a name for a lot longer than its been slang for weed
>Your first name is a drug

So is Brandy? And Sherry. Plenty of peopled named Margarita. 

I guess those are ridiculous too?
Pretty common for news articles so refer to subjects by their last names after introducing them.
It's funny they call her by her last name in a news article. You realize that's how it works, right?
"More cultural" ?


what does that even mean?
Most people called her mary so this was not an issue until she had some education and could use it to promote herself, sadly it backfired.
Did the article mention a husband?
Vandyck is her last name
No we don’t. Thank god we don’t have that nanny state crap here. 
Our government can’t even get its own shit together and now you want it to control peoples names?

Seriously, who gives a shit about someone else’s name?
[deleted]
Something tells me you discrediting anything will have zero impact on the world.
Cardinal Stritch University in Wisconsin. I found it in the caption at the very beginning of the article. Don't just read the headline.
She got a PhD in education. Her thesis is about factors that can impact student learning in the classroom. I don't see what the problem is here. You try getting a PhD.
She obviously doesn't want to.
She will change her name as soon as you change your to Fuckface McGee
She got a Ph. D in higher education.  She isn't going anywhere near patients, so I think retention isn't something to worry about.
Maybe let her decide what she should do?
Because of it she's achieved something the vast majority of people are incapable of. Would she even have pursued a doctorate if her name was Jill?
Not that kind of doctor.
If names didnt matter we societies wouldnt have made it a thing across the board. Words have meaning we name ourselves therefore our names automatically convey some sort of meaning. You step outside cultural norms and you will become a pariah, you can use that to motivate you and push you to the top or it will crush your esteem and you will fall. The fucked up part in this situation is it was thrust upon the kid but it seemed to make her stronger so happy ending. You can stand against the majority but you cannot assume they will change and for 90% of people names matter and mean something they hold our identity.
Think you went a little too dark there...
There's no blame. Her mother named her that to make her famous, and it worked.
So, that doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of society now associates Marijuana with a drug not a person's name.
None of those are great names, but also you don’t really see any Brandy Michelob Ultras’ as well.
All of those are not named after the drug though. Brandy is the female form of Brandon, Sherry is an old Gaelic name, and Margarita comes from the Greek Margaritari meaning pearl.
It's more like naming your kid Alcohol.
"Sherry Koch"
I've never met a Margarita, but yes alcohol is a drug too. Clearly one that's been socially acceptable since... at least the Greeks, probably before that but I'm not an alcohol historian. Marijuana doesn't have the same status.

Maybe Marijuana will become a name that doesn't phase people... in the future. It's not now, and the article tries to spin this into a racial name divide when it isn't. The same applies to naming your kid Cocaine, Heroin, Methaphetamine, or Oxytocin. Marijuana still has the "illegal drug" image, as it is still an illegal drug in numerous places.
No. I'm totally guessing because my imagination failed to come up with any other plausible reason that she added Vandyck to her name. I'm asking the question because the headline is says that she won't change her name to make other people happy. I'm certainly willing to stipulate that a husband isn't just any random other person.
[deleted]
I don't care but it's hilarious when she defends it so pathetically. She included race in her thesis. She's a racist. Every culture has had wild names and are just a subjective look at any certain time period. To take it further, names are just identifiers with no real value just used to be able to communicate with another person. So she and the university of Wisconsin is 100% full of shit. And I just want to control the idiots who name their kids Marijuana Pespi. Clearly, they need help.
So you let your 8 year olds choose their first tattoo?  You agree with the idea of blatantly building a supposition of a person by making their name built on a drug and junk food?  I get not wanting a nanny-state, but there has to be a limit before you’re literally disadvantaging a child. 

This person was lucky. There’s no way in hell that it’s a universal experience.
I don't know how it works in the States, but in Norway we have certain laws and rules in place to prevent your parents from naming you after the nutsack you came from. You're not allowed to use names with negative associations (such as diseases, Hitler etc.) or blatant joke names such as Peniis. Certain surnames are protected from use. 
The government is there to help you change your name, but it's also there to prevent bullying and other problems that might arise when you have a very unconventional name.
no , its saying some names are so stupid its in the best interest of the child to not name  them that 

The child is a human being with its own rights , just because you create a kid dosent mean you can do stupid shit to it ...

lots of countries ban stupid names
About the same impact your comment has on me. At least I know the truth lololol
The specific college is irrelevant.
Her conclusion must have been that her mom was either dumb as fuck or high as fuck when deciding her name. Because any factor she experienced was her mother's own doing. Quality parent right there
[deleted]
Do you know how reddit works?
Nah, forget that. She should change her name. It sounds stupid as fuck.
Oh gosh she'll never become a famous doctor now.
Right? Like a margherita pizza isn’t named so because it has tequila, lime, and sugar in it. It’s named so because the slices of mozzarella cheese resemble pearls.
Margarita is a drink named after a person, not the other way around.
Cannabis has been smoked to get high since about 2800 BC. It's status was fine until greedy, rich Americans started a fear campaign against it in order to sell paper. They used the Mexican name for it - marijuana because it sounded more scary to white people.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/21/marijuana-pepsi-unusual-name/?utm_term=.71ecb04f8b68 It seems Pepsi is her middle name. Unusual to say the least.
Inaccurately Comprehending Words for $1000, Alex.
I think I will trust her PhD thesis about this subject rather than your dumbass off-the-cuff opinion about it.
Strawman argument from the beginning.
Also people should be able to name their kids or be named whatever they want. Even if it’s “fuckhead”.
It's the same in some provinces of Canada. 

Sometimes I forget I'm living in such a freedomless hellhole... might need to cut down on the pot.
[deleted]
Then why bother asking questions?
>What pseudo college accepted that garbage so I know to discredit them from now on?

Maybe don't ask questions and then complain when you get an answer?
The whole point of the article is you *shouldnt* treat a kid different because they have weird or eccentric name ...


You seem casually fine with people getting bullied and disrespected over something trivial like a name ... one they didnt even choose for themselves ...
Say's the sperm king...
Our ideas and opinions are flawless. 

Prove me wrong.
Not at all the statement they were making to you condescending ass. Also considering both Mary and Jane originated out of Hebrew its a white ass name and Marijuana slang drug use far out paced the spanish naming their kids maryjane.
Thanks. It also appears to confirm that Vandyck is her ex-husband's surname.
[deleted]
They're worth about the same in 2019.
How? It’s something a person has, at minimum to the age of majority without major court intervention. It’s as permanent a decision as a child with a tattoo.  How do you justify naming your child after a drug and a junk food?
Yeah , that slippery slope only exists in your mind
I think he likes the sound of his own voice... narcissist much?
It was rhetorical

> When something stands out, you look at it. You question it. You wonder why.

yeah , that dosent have to extend itself into disrespect or mockery 

huge difference
No ..... No they don't
If Peole treat someone differently because of their name, that is an indictment on the person/society who is judging someone by their name, not the person with the name.
She seems like she's doing fine...
You should read catcher in the rye dumbass
If you need protection from yourself, check yourself into a mental institution.
indeed, anti-intellectualism at its finest.
Don't need experience when my logic is perfectly sound.
That’s a cheap and dishonest thing to say. You justify it by being apathetic which is a super shitty way to treat the wellbeing of people that aren’t old enough to legally make their own decisions. 

If you ever have children I hope you name a girl “cumcatcher” or a son “bananahammock” and tell me they grow up to be well adjusted adults.
[removed]
[deleted]
Except that is antithetical the entire point of higher education. Try again.
Why would I do that?
That would be pretty stupid. But if you wanted to name your kid "noseyloser" then go for it.

Your false high ground is the only dishonest thing in this chain.

Edit - naming your kid marijuana is like naming them jesus. I assume the parents are fuckin wack jobs but that's their right.
[deleted]
I do think it's unacceptable, regardless of the reason. Just be a decent person.
Yes , but you do it in private if you must lol

not to their face 

and you definitely dont use it as pretext to treat them like shit

lets be civil now , its a fucking hilarious name, yes 

we can be grown ups and not treat her like garbage over it though
I don't need anything but logic to dismantle her argument. That shows how shallow and empty it actually is. I don't need years of bullshit learning to understand how purpose, reason, society, and the human mind works because I can teach myself better than any school. People are easy to read.
Say it.. 'Mohammad', am I right?

Joshua..  (murderer of every man, woman and child, as well as the oxen, sheep and donkeys in Jericho..  Spared Rahab, she's my main B)
You do it because you can and your child has no choice!  That’s what you’re justifying.
Sure if youre here in good faith. But most of you nuts are only interested in fighting back when the government tries to make you pay your taxes or give you healthcare-oh the screams of tyranny.  But when children are dying in concentration camps its crickets.
Her name is Marijuana Pespi, it's dumb as fuck. Her putting up with the ridicule is hilarious too. It's like she's rejecting how ridiculous her name is and just wants to out up with the ridicule for the sake of putting up with it.
Sound logic can be based on faulty premises, and I don't see how you can "dismantle her argument" without even reading her thesis or being familiar with education and learning theories. You don't know more than subject-matter specialists just because you believe that your own limited understanding explains your experience of the world sufficiently. But feel free to continue being proud of your willful ignorance.
PHD DESTROYED with LOGIC and FACTS and HUMAN READING

Hey , thats Doctor Marijuana Pepsi to you good sir
Does every inch of my vision have to be filled with advertising?  Fuck this shit.  If companies start doing this shit I'm boycotting every single one I see.  Fuck this pisses me off to think I could be in the wilderness somewhere enjoying a sunset and a god damned ad will be in the sky alongside it.
So can we hurry up and get in place an international ban on ads in space, with the penalty of ~~nuking the headquarters of~~ dissolving any company involved in it?
"Space has to be beautiful. With the best brands our sky will amaze us every night," the website states.”

WTF, no.
The year is 2025. Fleets of Coca-Cola droneships in the Pacific launch the first salvo of low orbit, anti-satellite missiles at the Pepsi Billboard Sats blotting out the sky. In retaliation, Pepsi activates the strategically placed mass drivers targeting Coca-Cola HQ in the ruins of Atlanta. Colloquially known as "Rods from God", the massive tubes of compressed aluminum cans speed through the atmosphere and detonate Atlanta with the raw force of kinetic energy. Somehow MARTA is improved by the blasts.  
  
Humanity's last hope is a brave but determined group of resistance fighters just south of the border. A bold plan is formed which just might knock both Pepsi and Coke out using nothing more than mineral water and compressed CO2. The Topo Chico resistance has begun..
"advertising messages visible from the ground after sunset and before sunrise"

This guy gets paid by the word...
Advertisements are a cancer on society and everything good about the internet. I ignore them and avoid the products they're pushing as much as possible. Defacing our beautiful sky with their corporate graffiti is a good way to lose customers en masse.
Must have got the idea from an old Asimov or Clarke story, I forget which.
Not to sounds psycopathic but isn’t this what the Unabomber wrote in their manifesto?
I work in branding/marketing and I say FUCK THIS IDEA TO DEATH!
We know Pepsi exists for fucks sake
The fuck at that advertising gimmick.

"Space has to be beautiful. With the best brands our sky will amaze us every night."

Are you fucking kidding me? Space doesn't need your tacky ass brands to look good, it already fucking looks good. The sky doesn't need even more light blotting out the goddamn stars!
We need a startup to design and build a rocket that can grab and deorbit satellites before anything like this happens.
If this were to ever happen, I would dedicate my life to ensuring said satellites violent descent into said company’s headquarters.
Great now that everyone knows someone was about it, someone else will.
We all knew this was coming, I wonder how many times in the past this idea has been played around with? Imagine a Coca-Cola add popping up everytime  there is a full moon.
Who was the Madison Avenue genius that said “Let’s put a billboard in outer space”? 

Who was the hapless VP Marketing at Pepsi that gave this the nod?

I suppose there’s life after death for some.
"A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies. The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure."
They still need to go through with it, just not as Pepsi. The first company to do this will be the most hated company in the world. Eventually it will become hated but accepted.

The sites message is horrible:  


 

**The dream**

Andy Warhol said: “The most beautiful thing in Tokyo is McDonald's. The most beautiful thing in Stockholm is McDonald's. The most beautiful thing in Florence is McDonald's. Peking and Moscow don't have anything beautiful yet.”

Space has to be beautiful. With the best brands our sky will amaze us every night. 

**No ugly place there after this.**
I hadn’t even heard of this plan. The night sky is easily favorite thing about living on earth and if they somehow put an ad in front of that, I’d honestly probably dedicate my life to bringing it down
Story says it will not do that.
Yeah they’re done with that advertising campaign. The controversial buzz was the whole point.
Given the size and material an orbital billboard would need to be effective, what sort of engineering and maintenance challenges would a project like this present?

I can't imagine the amount of money you'd need to make before the cost of keeping the ad in orbit became worth it. And what about updates? Same ad for 10 years or do we crash it into the ocean and send up a new one every year?
Meh. I doubt it's as bad as say, trying (and failing) to write your name on the surface of the moon with a laser...
I'd be willing to deal with a good case of kessler syndrome if this ever happens.  Adblock, for space.
Well, there would be catastrophic tidal waves... but the upshot here: Kids love to surf.
They will just beam it on the moon.
People would have loved advertising like this in the 1980s.
I’m glad I’m going to die long before this sort of thing ever becomes commonplace.
It reminds me of *The Man Who Sold the Moon* by Robert Heinlein, except in that story people put up money to keep advertising out of space.
Seems more like a story designed to generate advertising itself rather than a real plan anyway.
How hard would it be to project the Pepsi logo onto the moon?
At first glance, "Pepsi Drops Plans To Use Orbital Bombardment". 

I really need to cut back on Stellaris.
Could we just get a giant Date and Time billboard that floats around. That would be kind of neat.
Read it so long ago - May still have the book in my library, may check when I get home - leaning to Clarke.
Enjoying that sunset? Why not enjoy it with a refreshing Sunny D^^TM ?
[This is all I can think of.](https://youtu.be/KpPE85Jogjw)
I’ve been angered by the ever expanding areas that advertising is expanding into, such as grocery store floors and bicycle towed billboards. About 18 years ago there were ads placed on gas pump nozzles, but that seemed to die off quickly.
Come to Asia. You'll get and eye full.
[Futurama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g) knows what's up. Next step we've got dream ads.
You would be surprised how much you can avoid it by running an AdBlocker (on both my phone and desktop) and keeping your media consumption 'off-line'. I use local downloads from my music streaming service, and use Plex to watch all my TV & movies. Cant stand listening to standard radio or watching cable these days because of the unreal amount of ads.
I’m with you, this is the wildest shit. Who the fuck thought this would ever be a good idea. That person needs to be fired. If any company does this, I hope they immediately go under and lose all business.
Just wait for the self driving cars to start playing ads on the infotainment screens.
I remember Coke was thinking about it years and years ago. All of my friends wanted to see it. I just couldn't relate.
I will get really into high altitude balloons as a hobby, as well as chemistry.  If you get my meaning.
I just think of the judge dredd comic where they use a huge projector to turn the moon into a giant billboard.
Death, taxes, and ads my friend.
The point is that even if you just glance at it for a moment and think nothing of it you eventually pick it up without thinking.

Sometimes it’s so much work to consciously avoid something that when you stop trying you actually go for what you’ve been avoiding because you’ve been thinking of it so much.
Dissolving them with space lasers
Their website honestly made me want to cry, the night sky is one of my favorite things about living on earth
These promoters of this technology need a firm rebuke laser-etched on their retinas. Fuckers.
 >Somehow MARTA is improved 

Come on man at least try to be realistic.
Eventually the fast food brands will join in supported by their chains soda brand of choice and we all know that “Demolition Man” accurately predicted Taco Bell will triumph.
Found Thomas Pynchon's reddit account.
That MARTA line is amazing! I hope that you read or hear something tomorrow that brings you the same joy and laughter that you gave me tonight. 



(Also, the idea of literal cola wars is both hilarious and terrifyingly plausible.)
ads seen in the night sky
They probably mean shortly after sunset/before sunrise, not at midnight. Presumably the billboard would be illuminated by the Sun when the sky is dark.
No, they are just a symptom. Our current edition of Capitalism is the cancer.
Asimov has Buy Jupiter. Clarke has one where scientists try to artificially induce an aurora, but an engineer stencils Drink Coca Cola into the machine.
Or Futurama.
also could've been Philip K. Dick.
Or Judge Dredd.
The Man Who Sold the Moon by Heinlein
Or Black Mirror
Pretty much. Good message bad delivery with evil intentions, thus what to expect from a sociopath. At least he's where he's no longer a public threat.

Our goal is to strive for goodness... that trait which humanity selected throughout our evolution.
I'm in. Time to start stockpiling laser guided missiles.
I think New Moon would be easier.  Some big mirrors at lagrange points, or something.
"There is no such thing as bad publicity" -- all you need is a "story" and some recent Harvard or Stanford MBA will convince themselves that everyone will secretly love them for it.  That mindset tells them that people actually *love* advertising but need a bit of a push to recognize that fact.  Their pet model is magazine advertising -- the various locations in a magazine can be correlated to real-world sales figures so they know exactly how much to charge for, say, TIME magazine's upper-left quadrant on page 23.  25 years in to advertising on the internet, and they still have no way to produce those kinds of reliable metrics.

But there's a practical limit on how obnoxious or intrusive a magazine ad can be -- which caps off at the level of the scented pull-out ads in cosmetics magazines.

When they can't get the data they want from internet advertisements, their only response is to ratchet up the parts of advertising that people hate -- interstitials and flyovers and delayed pop-ups and all that garbage.  That's because (IMO) there is no practical limit on how obnoxious they can get.  So axiomatically, internet ads *must* be annoying in order to produce reliable positive influence on revenue.   Which is why adblockers exist.  If all there were were unobtrusive static ads that never delayed page rendering, it would be hard to imagine adblocking having any kind of broad appeal.

I secretly wish/fear that someday soon big advertising heads will realize that internet-based advertising on any large scale just isn't cost-effective in the long run.
When are constantly reminded of their reality that this is *their* Earth. 

Who has the gold, has the power, and us thinking we have any power is a fiction they have us believe so we may continue to do their bidding

I think that once it can be done practically, there's no way to prevent it.    I have this idea that advertising must necessarily be every bit as obnoxious as a particular medium will allow.
Yea me too. And as one who had an extremely abusive childhood, some older brother physical, but most was brutally emotional by an inadequate mother being taught children ruin parents' live I engrained myself to the thought of not having children which I'm glad I didn't for...

... the mere thought of their pain endured as they perished would consume me long before the on-rushing Shockwave
Kool, thanks, I'm heading to search it now.

This is exactly why I do Reddit, to find out things like this from people like you
lol, I can see Sunny D's pitch.  You know sun visors for car windows?  Light can still get through, but it's dim and you can still see whatever graphic is on it?  Imagine the sun peaks through and it's a giant sunscreen that they deployed in orbit to perfectly match the suns journey across the sky somehow and it's a gigantic Sunny D logo.

Not here. We have video advertisements at the pumps
Try going to asia some time. Holy fuck, the ads.
There are video screens at almost every gas station I go to these days. Do we really need ads or news in my face while I pump gas.
can you imagine how awed you would feel if you were in the presence of a wealthy individual, who was able to pay for the "no ads" package?  Wherever they walked, ads would disable around them!

I'm poor, so i get the most annoying ads for the shit tier garbage i can afford.  Sucks when i'm out with my girl, as she comes from money, and she's totally embarrassed by my ads.  Hers are fucking dope, but mine trump hers cause we are shipped on FB.  

My kids' ads are the worst, though, those fucking jingles!
What do you use on mobile (Android)? I use uBlock Origin on my browsers.
Just don't have disposable income I guess.
Seriously, I felt sick. The reasoning is disgustingly twisted. The sky can amaze us every night already, don't go blocking it with a bunch of logos!
Because they Baja Blasted away the competition.
"Carl's Junior. *Fuck you.  I'm eating.*"
ah you mean the Franchise Wars. I remember those days.
In grad school, some buddies of mine and I had a script written for news flashes giving updates on the war on Christmas.  Like field officer as in the 1990s "desert shield" briefings saying "at this time, we have Christmas contained to about a two-square-mile region bounded by Arden Road to the North and Garden Parkway to the South, between I-80 and US 50" (part of Sacramento, CA where shopping malls and big-box stores abound).  At some point, someone in a camoflage elf suit throws a shiny multi-colored box with ribbons and sparkles all over it in front of the field officer, who yells "FIRE IN THE HOLE" and ducks for cover.

Apparently we never actually got drunk enough to do it -- which is saying a lot considering it was law school.
Night sky advertising
That's what my professor says too!
That’s one I was recalling - thanks! Was Clarke.
In their defense I also thought title implied they were presenting this.  The term “drops” can be used both ways.
That's a new one. Redditor ignores the headline but reads the article.
I think they read "drop" like how an artist can "drop" a new album.
It's flat coke, so no it's not.
I’m talking about on the actual nozzle, like this: https://www.petrolpumpadvertising.co.uk/windowworx-tesco-petrol-pump-campaign/
Use the  Brave app runs on chrome and it blocks ads
That's probably why the 1% is so fanatical about having all the money -- they're protecting us!
No, you just need a positive goal instead of a negative restriction.
The passed few days I’ve been reading a lot into global warming and shit like this and the world is just really bumming me out
Case of English being confusing as fuck with words having several meanings.
Here in Germany that's still standard at pretty much every gas station
Thats why context is important.  Drops isnt used to mean released in that context.  Ive never seen that even once.

That usage isnt even proper,  its slang.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drop

No offense meant,  but if youre a native English speaker this shouldn't be confusing. I could easily see it being confusing to someone who speaks English as a secondary language.
Cool. I'm sure they're entitled to sell anything they want 
If only they put this much effort into fixing their state. Worry about some guy in SF kneeling while your state is a crumbling shithole. But hey whatever to own the libs 

lol pathetic
Wtf? They kneel when they pray...can’t they kneel when the national anthem is sung?
Kapernick isn't even signed by a team...
I'm liberal... Im not mad. I think the owner is an idiot and making a poor business decision. But its not my call is it? Its his store he gets to decide what he will and will not sell.
This will surely trigger those idiot liberals who always get offended and need to censor the littlest things.

Holy shit you guys, do I really need to put /s at the end of this?

This will fix *all* of Alabama's problems!
He is drumming up a lot of free advertising for his store.
I used to live in Alabama not far from Athens it is a shithole town in a shithole county in a shithole state. They could easily fix quite a few of their problems but refuse to. 
It is a convenience store.  Not an actual grocery store.  Also, dude isn't sticking to his guns much because it is already off his FB page.  Lol
Why is it just Pepsi? Is he removing the official beer? Or Gatorade? I'm sure there are plenty of cardboard displays with the logo on it. This dude's a clown. He's hoping this will generate some business.
Sry im swedish and dont follow NFL. Is this about kneeling or is his outrage about something else??
Maybe they should hire a John Belushi look-alike to sit behind the counter and say: "No Pepsi, Coke!"

Or am I showing my age?
So shouldn't  he not sell any pepsi... smh
Are players even kneeling this year? 
I mean they’re idiots but who cares?
Wow, such courage, way to save the world
Why football man no stand?
I should think about selling my Pepsi Co. stock before this hits earnings next quarter.
Sounded like Athens ended up being Athens.
What a racist moron halfwit
Maybe if they did it to protest TBI that would be okay.
Looking at that photo, I would say they need less sugary products on their shelf anyway
Well, at least it’s not a decision affecting the nutrition of their customers.
I mean it's Alabama.. Should probably be called a good thing the store is not in the news for incest instead 
The only highly paid professional football players they will support play for the University of Alabama.
I imagine this will work out for them well, Alabama is a staunch coke territory anyways. About the only Pepsi product that area drinks is mountain dew. Couple minimal sales with a potential boost of sales from people who feel politically motivated to shop there and you get an increase in overall sales of other things.

Yep. This right here could be the turning point. 
[deleted]
I dont care what the justification is no store should be allowed to sell Pepsi without offering coke as a substitute. 
I'm still trying to find a downside to this.  Will they also refuse to sell Coke products with the NFL product as well?  Can the NFL put their image on all the unhealthy things that people drink in Alabama?
Next your gonna suggest they legalize dildos. 
Am Alabama man, saw Facebook post about this on local news page- bunch of hillbillies praising how they plan to go more often.

Looked at the store page- middle of damn nowhere and the only store in that village.

Still sad to be Alabama man. 
At least I work with kids and try to teach them values like empathy and critical thought.
why footballman no stand up?’ 
They? Just one store man. Chill
hey now, we got a (D) Senator!  It's a damn miracle!
Some grocery store owner decides to not sell a product and it is the whole state's fault now? Hmm, I want to say there is something about generalizations in there, but I just cannot quite figure out what it is atm....
/r/ownthelibs
Stop selling sugary sodas in grocery stores and the obesety problem in Alabama will improve.

Maybe this is a good start?
You should see their insane Constitution
Alabama is secretly a fantastic place to live and grow up. Good lifestyle. Beautiful land. 

I know Reddit enough to know why your vote is currently #1, but it is just a post of ignorance.

The store owner is also as ignorant as your post. But he can be criticized without having to say stupid things about a state that is pretty nice to live in.

Does that mean every last person in Alabama is doing great or that everything is awesome there? No. Are you a fucking child that I have to explain that to you? I hope not. Children should not be on reddit. Now go be productive. 
What's wrong with our State? Place is paradise. Wouldn't want to live anywhere else. Beautiful Beaches, great hunting, fantastic fishing. Truly a nature lovers dream. Low taxes, affordable housing, tons of jobs from low skill service based to high skill aerospace. Alabama like every other State has it's issues, but if it was the shithole you claim it is people wouldn't be moving here left and right. EDIT: Yeah you haters may down vote me but no one wants to actually say why Alabama is supposedly so horrible. Keep on circle jerking guys and gals it will get you far in life.

What would you like them to do? They don't have legions of millionaires like SF does to tax. 
Uh what ?  Anything is better than that shithole California.  Record high homelessness and national attention for the amount of human feces on their sidewalks.  Get out of here lol
Actually that’s a really good point, I remember players kneeling to pray but now all of a sudden it’s a problem. Asshats. 
Also peaceful protest with no hateful words... fairly American thing to do with a  simple kneel.
Kneeling was never seen as disrespectful until Republicans had a problem with it.  It's been a sign of subservience and respect for hundreds, even thousands of years.
NFL players kneel out of disrespect for a flag that represents racism to them.  Christians do it for an entirely different reason.  

Context matters especially when you're talking about symbolism.
Nine out of ten Pepsi drinkers wear Nike shoes, so....
I don't believe anyone is mad. People fall into two camps!

"Right on! "Murica! Fuck the NFL and fuck Pepsi!"

"Heh, what a moron."
I have a sports bar called beefoBrady’s who hasn’t shown the nfl this season or last. It’s a ghost town in there most days because of this. They have that right, but it’s a terrible business decision. 
> Holy shit you guys, do I really need to put /s at the end of this?

Yes. The last few years have indicated that someone out there is actually stupid enough to believe what you posted unironically, and then lay it out for the world to read. 
Yeah, you need the /s no matter what, because satire is nearly impossible these days.
Kind of sounds like the offended ones are the owners of the store. Dare I say they appear to be triggered.
I’m a liberal and the only thing that’s triggered is my curiosity. What’s this dudes beef with the NFL? Head injuries or something?
Sadly yes 
Sadly, yes you do.  

Go read fox news comments for about 10 minutes, (**Warning, may cause brain cancer**), your comment could have been cut and pasted right out of just about any story about anything.  
or the players can stop playing... what do you want the NFL to do, ban tackling?
Add the fact that the NFL has profited off the talent and skill of primarily black super star players for decades but turns their back on them when they dare stand up for themselves. Predatory and shameful. 
At the league minimum salaries, every NFL player signed to a team makes around $1.5 million in their first three years (and it's a 3-year minimum first contract). That's more money than most people will ever see in their lifetimes.

I think it's more than fair for people to risk their health for that kind of money. Coal miners (for example) are guaranteed to get fucked up bad and they don't get anything close to that much.
Next up is boycotting Crimson Tide gear due to Nike affiliation. Duh
i grew up a handful of miles from that store. 

trust me, he will be getting no extra business. that store is a shithole in the middle of nowhere. anyone who drives out there just for that reason is an exceptional idiot. if it wasn't for the nuclear plant nearby it would have probably closed already. 
Athens, AL? On I65?      What you mean?    I grew up just west of there in Florence and I can't sweet talk the Shoals area enough. Arguably the best place to live in the entire state. 
If only the article answered your questions 
not sure tbh. players were kneeling last year and i believe the year before that as a sign of protest against police brutality, particularly in black communities where cops were using unnecessary force across the board. after there was enough outcry against them doing this, claiming the players were against their country, the troops, the president, whatever, and including cries to have them fired or fined. iirc the NFL itself said that players were to either not come out before the game, or they had to stand and could not kneel or they would be fined. recently the controversy has been reignited as Nike began an ad campaign with one of the players who had started doing these protests.

on one hand, its the stores right to refuse to carry the product. on the other hand, they're just roping another corporation into this controversy. that, and its pretty pathetic overall to be upset over the players protesting.
Some shit about rich people doing shit that pisses other rich people off who then rally their masses of poor people to hate the first group of rich people. It gets confusing after a while. 
People are mad some players wont stand for the “special flag song” in protest of police brutality.

The rallying cry of Pepsi products:

>... Is Pepsi ok?
If they have pepsi, they have Mtn Dew.
Many stores can either sell one or the other, as the two companies don’t like being under the same roof. This is also why many restaurants only have coke or Pepsi products. 
Oh look it’s a lesser being with inferior taste buds. Anyone who prefers bottled coke over bottled Pepsi is a piece of shit and should be locked up. It’s a proven fact you’re a degenerate. 
Lmao dildos. God gave us cousins for a reason

Didn't close to half of them vote for a known pedophile this year?
It’s not like it some secret that Alabama is a shit hole 
It's like how we expect crazy stories to originate from Florida. We expect stories about stupid racist shitheads to come from Alabama. Sorry. Don't be mad bro. We're not mad. We're laughing at Alabama, although in this case, we're laughing at everyone who hates the NFL and/or Pepsi for this particular reason.
Thats fair.  It must be a slow news day
Well, he’s not wrong though....
People are very quick to show how truly bigoted they are when they think the crowd has their back. 
The crushing poverty, frivolous court cases brought by the state repeatedly (we are voting to ban abortion and put up the ten commandments in courtrooms. Again on both), and the skyhigh usage of hard drugs.

And the general lack of jobs unless you live in Birmingham or Huntsville 
Alabama has higher effective state and local tax rates than California. https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-to-be-a-taxpayer/2416/#detailed

Plus it's hot and miserable in the summer. Hunting and fishing are your opinion  but seriously, what fan you hunt in Alabama besides deer and hogs? 

Oh yeah, it's a backwards state filled with racists and ignoramuses.


According to this. Alabama has on average bout 7,000 people move into it each year which is far lower than any surrounding state except Mississippi.
>Yeah you haters may down vote me but no one wants to actually say why Alabama is supposedly so horrible.

The people. It's the people who live there that make Alabama horrible. Understand now?
oh no, homeless people like good weather and a rich city. What a crisis. Way worse than almost electing a pedophile to the senate and being bottom of the list in nearly every ranking from education to infrastructure
and yet SF alone is growing faster than anywhere in Alabama and has a bigger GDP than the entire state of AL. 

says a lot about Alabama. roll tide.
Uh, as much as they criticized coastal elites, they certainly are using our tax dollars. 
They do have millionaires, they have a shit ton of natural resources and they have a coast line.  They could raise money and redistribute if they want to.
That doesn't seem to stop them [reaching in to California's pocket](https://imgur.com/a/ktZqOsb)
Sixth largest economy in the world. Alabama wouldn't be able to pave its roads if it stopped sucking from the juicy California tax teat
People here loved it when Tebow kneeled during the anthem to protest abortion. 
I don't care one way or another about the football kneeling, but it's not a good point, or comparison. Is Kaep kneeling to show penance and submission toward the United States?

Do Christians kneel when they pray to protest God? Two different reasons for kneeling, do you see how that works?
Yeah, remember when one NFL player got penalized for kneeling to pray to God for their touchdown?

Or when other players would kneel? I can't believe the hypocrites...
"But it's not politically correct! Stop iiit!!" 
Alabama is not a fan, historically, of peaceful protests...
...unless it is customary to stand during something, and the guy kneeling made known that it wasn't a sign of subservience and respect, but of protest.

I really don't care either way about the issue, but you are just being silly if you're saying Kaep was trying to be subservient to the anthem or that kneeling was never seen as disrespectful until 2016 Republicans.
I believe that it depend on which knee you kneel on...
O_o

You have a statements from those NFL Players that clearly stated their reasons for that and it included Racism? If so, all the more POWER to them, because of this shit, I have seen people either work hard to achieve it or just plain gave up.
I think you need to lay off the tide and get a pocket constitution; freedom trumps religion. 
Well thank good I wear puma
i think that was the joke here.
Kaepernick because he is speaking out. They can’t stand it and don’t understand anything about it
Literally because some players chose to kneel during the national anthem before NFL games to protest racial inequality. 

The idiot right, however, willfully allow themselves to misinterpret this as a display of hatred for the troops and the country. 

Essentially it's just another justification to hate persons of color.

I don't see a problem with that. They have made many black millionaires, and through the hope of some day making it to the NFL, provided countless other black children with hope for a way out of their less than ideal situations.

The NFL not wanting you fucking off or tarnishing their brand on field isn't too much to ask, in my opinion.
Because it impacts the NFLs profits. They dont care as long as you arent hurting their money. 
Its a money decision. As it should be considering the NFL needs to make a profit to play the players salary.

Hey neighbor.  I'm over here in madison.

I read the article. There's no mention of any other sponsors. Quaker oats, Tostitos, Campbell's soup, etc.
Yeah i just figured it was about kneeling since he brought the troops into the conversation.
I can imagine it's confusing to idiots. NFL players are kneeling to protest police brutality. Anything other than that is narrative.
liberals don't hate america. And lets not pretend that people are pissed off because he is disrespecting the flag. The flag gets disrespected all the time by right wingers. Its just the same ol' story... you are looking for a reason to be pissed.

Also, you didn't even answer the guys question, you went on a rant.

&#x200B;

"yes its about the kneeling" is the correct answer
> They ignore the fact that the vast majority of cops shooting blacks were more than justified in these cases.

lol imagine thinking this, what with all the folks that have been unjustifiably shot by cops these past few years.

One such shooting even happened when a cop *accidentally broke into someone else's house* and shot the dude. That same cop wasn't even drug tested, as is protocol after using a firearm outside of range work.
Fun fact They are legally obligated to do this because in the 60’s or so when Coke and Pepsi started to heavily compete, Coke used to send agents into popular restaurants that weren’t under their contract and order a coke and they were served Pepsi so they would end up suing these places for falsely advertising their product. A lot of the time Pepsi was simply cheaper so these places contracted with them even though coke was widely more popular at the time and so a lot of places omitted the truth when people ordered a “Coke” but they only had Pepsi. 
I’ll just have water then..
This is the correct answer
I know lol I was just making a joke because I like Coke way more and think Pepsi tastes watery.

referred to as the "Southern Strategy" it was so successful that many Republicans don't even realize it happened.  You will often hear people these days talking about how they're the party of Lincoln, and talking about the Democrats from the turn of the 20th century as the same Democrats today.  

Ironically, they will call themselves the party of Lincoln while holding a Confederate flag, so not sure how much they actually know about the extreme irony of their ridiculous position.  
Yep, it was the 98% of black women who had common sense and saved us by voting for Doug Jones. In contrast 63% of white women here voted for the guy who doesn't think women should even be allowed to vote.

Drug usage is a issue in every State. Jobs are plentiful here in South Alabama. Baldwin County is booming, Mobile County booming, wages are on the rise in the area due to the lack of workers.

Yes, for things like the military and the roads and railways that bring products to you. Federal spending in states like that is puny. 
hehe, they'd have to start voting for people who wanted to do that, and that's impossible in AL.  This is a solid bastion of conservative values. 
Raise money on who? People who make $10 an hour? They're already begging people to build factories and mines, they certainly can't just jack up taxes and expect them to do anything besides close up shop and go somewhere else. Places like SF can attract the wealthy with any tax rate, that's why they get away with it, and that's why only the wealthy can live in SF. 
Most of what the government does (particularly military and research) is done in red states, that's why the money goes there. You need their highways as much as they do. 
Exactly. While we’re at it, try to explain that the national anthem is paid for by the USA gov to get people to SUPPORT THE TROOOPS, not the nfl and it wasn’t always part of the routine. 

Eh, may as well not even bother it just gets them pissed off. 
[Except that didn't happen](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tim-tebow-kneel-anthem/)
Yeah? What did those people say when they saw Tebow kneeling during the anthem?
Kneeling during a game, wasting time and effectively showboating versus kneeling before kickoff during the one-minute reaffirmation of patriotism^tm

If you can't tell the difference, then either you aren't interested in any kind of sport and you're just here to complain, or you are just here to complain period.
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
I mean I don't think it was to disrespect the flag at all, it was just to make a point.... but I also don't see a problem with a protester burning a flag because they were unhappy with their government, which is definitely an unpopular opinion.  I took it as kneeling to the flag instead of standing to stick out and draw attention so he could use it to talk about the issue.  If he was trying to to it to disrespect the flag or whatever he would have just sat down in a seat and ignored the flag all together.  It was never about the fucking flag, and i sure as hell dont see kneeling before and looking up at the flag as disrespectful.
Nobody is saying he should be put in prison over it...

Yeah but why go against the NFL from a conservative stand point. The NFL, unless I'm out of the loop, sided with Trump on punishing those who protest. I assumed this was a left leaning store or something.
> willfully allow themselves to misinterpret this as a display of hatred for the troops and the country.

That may be what they say, but most of the people who have expressed those kinds of opinions around me have done so with a wink and nod as if to say, "you know what I'm really talking about fellow white man?", then launched into one racist rant or another.

If white players had been doing to to protest Obama or something or Christians had been doing it to protest abortions, they wouldn't have a problem with it.  
You should see if there's an Australian Rules Football league somewhere near you. It's a very fast paced game and they really value big players, especially tall ones.
but the clock stopping is part of the game... every time a pass is not complete, a player goes out of bounds, the ball changes possession, the two minute warning, the end of quarters, the half (15 mins), when there is an injury, during all 12 timeouts during the game, when a first down is made, when a touchdown is made and when a field goal is made. 

How often does the clock stop in the game of soccer? 

Of course, they don't *have* to show advertisements, they could just pan the camera across an empty field for 30 seconds to two minutes...
They're black whether you acknowledge it or not. Colorbliness is BS.

Because it's not about sponsorship it's about the logo for whatever dumbass reason he came up with 
yeah, if you have any criticisms of the US, one or two outlets are bound to try to rope it into support of the military and/or other institutions, and many of their followers will eat it up and perpetuate it. we have a lot of problems here and these types of situations exploits them to push the argument aside.
Yeah, because kneeling has something to do with the troops.  /s

Around the same percentage of black women vote Democrat no matter what so it wasn't exactly common sense on their behalf. It's just probably what they do and will continue to do in the near future.

And the percentage of white women you mentioned will probably vote Republican in the next election, not that they necessarily wanted to vote against their suffrage. It's called voting the party line. Oh well...
The answer was yes.  That state is fucked.

It's a bonafide mental disorder. Lmao. 
I'll agree that Baldwin and mobile county are growing- but the real issue there is the job quality. The job growth in that area is primarily in service and retail, followed by manufacturing. That in itself isn't terrible, but those jobs don't lead to a larger career for most folks  that work them. And wages haven't caught up to decent rates for the most part out there- and those manufacturing investments are likely to slow- turning Baldwin county into a bigger version of Decatur?

Livable, but no thanks.

The drug issue in Alabama is worse than most other states. Most things (education, life span, obesity, poverty, etc) are worse in Alabama. It's usually tied back to corrupt politicians and the dumb Bible thumpers who want to elect Roy Moore to any available post 
Few states can show the level of multi generational poverty that Alabama has. We have towns that don't even have proper sewage or water. 

And the worst part is, in those areas there are very few ways out.

Not sure how SF can fix their issue now, but they need to try to figure out something regarding pricing and homelessness (which one will help the other somewhat).
Poor hick states buy bus tickets to Cali for homeless people because they can't afford social services. Cali is also warm, and rich, so much better begging opportunities than your typical Alabama trailer park.

Yes, that's actually a good point, about kneeling instead of sitting.

Probably shouldn’t burn your Nikes over it either; the true snowflakes.
The NFL had everyone kneel including owners and such when Trump made comments and wanted them to punish the players. 

The NFL skews conservative, and it was impacting the bottom line.  Its why they tried to pass rules for players to either stand or be in the locker room, the NFLPA is contesting these rules. 
I had that happen to me last night. Some red neck was talking about how he caught a black woman stealing Amazon packages and I was like So you called the cops right? And hes like she's black. And I'm thinking "you didnt answer my question, did you call the cops"

It is a huge problem when dozens of police per year aren't held accountable for shooting unarmed people.




Kind of moving the goal post there aren't we. The moment a serious point gets made about police abusing their athority against minorities, you switch to the "They're killing each other fine without the cops." Which kills me when I hear you lot talk about BLM, a.k.a. an Armed group that to white conservatives seem like a force that is out of control, the irony is you have been thinking closer to along the lines as Minorties see police, by thinking this way about BLM.

Some of the smarter ones will just lie, and then you are stuck trying to fact check something that sounds off, but you might not be sure.  My favorite was people blaming Obama for Katrina.  Just attack, doesn't matter if it's true.

I'm from Georgia and the fact that you left out blatant and repeated election tampering shows you're just talking shit about some Cletus you saw a meme of. Georgia is full of proper villains, don't let the yokels distract you.
What does Georgia has to do with Alabama, and while I was only through there once I think, I thought Georgia was not that bad of a state, although Atlanta was just nuts, but that was at a truck stop, not sure what the city proper was like.
Ive been all over Alabama. But I'm from new York. Plenty of neighborhoods in new york that are orders of magnitude worse than the worse areas I've seen in Alabama.

Trump was the GOP nominee, so conservatives were going to vote for him.  Trump in the primaries was the loudest bully on stage, so Alabamans were going to vote for him.  

Bama never had a chance!
You give me a strawman argument, and then ask for empirical sources. 
Just because Trump mouths off on Twitter doesn't mean anyone is going to arrest him.  The only pushback he has gotten are people saying they'll boycott watching the NFL, buying Nike merchandise, and in this case not selling anything with a NFL logo.  That's a pretty far cry from violating Colin's rights.
Injuries are a part of sports, unfortunately. However, rugby, afl, and other contact ball sports have much less rates of brain injuries than gridiron. I think it's because of the lack of padding and the nature of the games. AFL and Rugby are very hard hitting, yes, but gridiron seems to be specifically designed to hit as hard as possible against other players. 
They don't stop the game just for ads. Ads are played when the clock stops naturally, usually when defense and offense switch. 
Who's judging people? Also MLK was only human. He isnt the speaker for all black people.
They do, but it's more to drum up ratings or attention if it's "OMG he's not selling Pepsi" instead of "not selling products that have the NFL logo on it." 

TBH I cannot recall the last time I seen a Quaker oats, Tostitos, or even the Campbell Soups adverts on TV. However, an advert for Pepsi and Coke are very common and love to be everywhere.

They taste the same
I would assume that the menu would show who makes the product and the seller assumes the customer wants a specific category of drink. At least I never heard of anyone that changed his mind about the drink after hearing that it was made by Pepsi.
Nah, men drink beet juice. 
Jenny was trash with a shitty upbringing. 
Right, but the state % of folks on hard drugs versus not on hard drugs is worse in Alabama. That's the point.  


I would assume more total people do drugs in California or New York than in Alabama, but the percentage of folks who do hard drugs is what matters.

there are more people in LA than Mississippi. more people in LA County than both states combined.
Lets compare SF to the biggest city in Alabama. Birmingham has more murders, more rapes, 3x burglaries. Density means fuck all. Alabama is a rampant shithole 
Yes, millions of people too stupid to stop paying for cable do watch Fox News.

IDK man, your trolling patriotism may be enough to provide enough for everybody.
Can you cite any evidence for claiming those sports have lower rates of brain injury? As I understand it, subconcussive hits are shown to be just as risky, maybe even higher risk, for CTE. Further, there's little long term evidence as cases are literally only diagnosed after death. I'd love ro see data that actually shows what you stated. [Here](https://www.bu.edu/cte/about/frequently-asked-questions/) are a couple of [sources](https://concussionfoundation.org/CTE-resources/what-is-CTE) I found, including [one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/20/link-between-concussion-and-brain-damage-to-ensure-afl-debate-rages) specifically regarding Aussie rules football. My takeaway is, the debate over safety rages on, and there is a serious lack of good evidence for what is 'safer' or how to deal with the problem. 
Since all NFL games are broadcast on major networks, it's hard to have a comparison, but I attended a Division I school with a mediocre football team. Sometimes we were on national tv, sometimes we weren't. It was a pain in the ass going to a game when it was on a major broadcast. They absolutely added a ton of timeouts for commercials.
I'm sure they accomdate it. The NFL makes a lot of money on its tv deals

Actually you did, the conversation up to that point was regarding police and minorities, after providing incidents where the police abused their power you switched to minority on minority violence, without so much as acknowledging he was right. What would you call that?
Assuming isnt exactly that smart. The reason menus list the products now are because this used to happen, but its also the reason every restaurant will correct you if you ask for a coke and they only have pepsi. 

Uh you must not know a lot of people I know plenty of people who will change their order to a mountain dew when its pepsi products being offered, personal anecdotes and assumptions are a really poor way at arguing though. 

The point is restaurants 50-60 years ago didn’t have detailed menus and if they even had menus that listed drinks on them they often just said the types and not the brand names. Coke was losing money because restaurants realized they could buy cheaper cola from pepsi, put it down as cola on the menu, and when a customer asked for Coke they wouldn’t correct them. It wasn’t sleazy on Cokes part, it was necessary to 1. Protect their brand and 2. Make money by selling to restaurants who want to serve coke instead of pepsi. Nothing really to argue as sleazy on Cokes part there and it was 100% sleazy of restaurants to not correct people wanting a specific drink and serve them something different. 
Every time I order a Coke and the waitress asks if Pepsi is OK, I say, "Fuck no. I'll take a Dr. Pepper."

Heroin od's by state is publically available and Alabama isn't anywhere close to the top of the list of od's per capita. Idk why people get so xenophobic about states in their own fucking country. 

Edit: Alabama is ranked 38/50 out of all the US states (1 being the most) in heroin deaths per capita. Some drug infested hell hole. /s

In the southeastern US, people call literally any brown cola (even Dr pepper) a "coke". Phrases like "what kind of coke do you want?" are not uncommon. So yeah, definitely a sleazy move by coke to try and sue people. That's like asking for a Kleenex and suing someone for giving you a generic tissue. 
>The reason menus list the products

is because a menu is a literally a list of products.

According to push polls and phone polls, who has landlines OLD PEOPLE so most trusted by least informed segment of society. People who can't figure out what a PDF or program a remote. 
Not ignoring, just pointing out how you pushed the arguement back, while ignoring the good point the guy gave, and context as to why I agree.
Sorry nah, if you order a Coke in any restaurant they should know, because its a fucking restaurant and not your grandmas living room, that not **everyone** means coke so especially when someone would ask for something that you’re saying is the equivalent of saying “get me a soda”, the restaurant should ask what type of “Coke” they want  otherwise you have a ton of people getting Pepsi when they meant Dr Pepper as per your example. 

Just because it soaked into the colloquial as a generalized term in some places doesn’t mean that restaurants can use sleazy tactics like that. Its their responsibility to confirm with you your order and tell you what you’re going to get. **Not a sleazy tactic,** you clearly have no business aptitude if you think otherwise and think that all of these restaurants were making genuine mistakes rather than buying cheaper cola and not mentioning it was the cheaper brand. 
You know what I mean but you’re just being pedantic, right?
Where does BBQ fit in this?

[They've already canned the idea.](https://www.geek.com/culture/pepsi-abandons-dystopian-space-billboard-plan-for-russian-gamer-soda-1783207/) Probably because a lot of us would never buy Pepsi again if they ruined the night sky with their ad, even for a single night. For me, the same would go for any brand that decided that this is okay.
[removed]
This makes me think of Red Dwarf (the novel, not the TV series) where the Nova 5 was one of many ships sent on a mission to induce the supernova of 128 supergiant stars in order to create a five-week-long message in the sky visible even in daylight, reading "COKE ADDS LIFE!"
People already prefer Coke over Pepsi - they think this will help?
Someone should shoot this down.
We gotta ask our senators to outlaw it.
I wonder how long till we go full Futurama and companies just start projecting ads into our dreams.
I’ll be drinking a coke watching this if it happens
THANK you!  I would boycott anyone who advertised like that too. Whew.  Glad to know it's not going to happen.
Pepsi supports T Series so nobody should buy their products
Absolutely agree! Don't mess with our sky. Commercials/advertisements are like hypnosis and should be greatly diminished.
[deleted]
"ruined the night sky" - Light pollution has already done that.

But I agree that it would be an egregious act.
Just about as much as we need more ways to be advertised to
Is this what that one Futurama episode was based on? Where Fry drags the stars to spell a proposal (I think)?
Yep. That's money they could spend coming up with a good tasting product.
I would personally start a Go Fund Me to buy missiles to shoot those satellites down if that happened.
*it would have not been in the US though. Since space advertising has been banned here since 1993.
Of course, then it would come out that Coke did it to try and damage Pepsi's reputation, which would not only result in a larger backlash against Coke but also probably result in Pepsi suing Coke. It would not end well for Coke. Best to let Pepsi shoot themselves in the foot on this one.

I've got it - New Pepsi. A totally new flavor that everyone will hate. Then they can come out with Pepsi Classic.
No, you are rhinking too high tech. They will probably just start breaking into our houses, sedating us, and tattooing ads onto us in our sleep.
Well, other posts have been made claiming that our brains will be connected to the internet in a couple decades, so there's that. Time to start work on NeuroAdBlock (TM).

I think the real wtf is that the woman drinks 12 cans of pepsi a day. 
There's no way that image is from an actual can. Probably some packaging or advertising with that picture transferred the image. 
Now the lobster gets free Pepsi for life.
>Human garbage "is really widespread, just about anywhere," . . .  
But Lindstrand still finds herself wondering how on Earth that lobster got that "Pepsi tattoo."


this is soda pressing
Thank God I was notified of this. 
Who the F drinks 12 cans of Pepsi a day?
All I wanted was a Pepsi! Just one Pepsi!
Is this just a pepsi ad?
This is cool, but I definitely need to turn my notifications off for the Reddit app
Ah, I've seen we found the UN delegate to Atlantis.
The choice... of a new crustacean.
the real story is that she drinks 12 pepsi's day 
He must have went to a tattoo artist that didn't serve Coke tattoos.
Is this how lobsters rebel against their parents?
Pepsi is just the fucking marketing king. Guarantee whoever caught the lobster had to grab a can after this. 
Crustaceans will do anything to seem "edgy" these days. Undersea fashion used to mean something. Now the measliest molly mussel can get away without a shell in the name of "art". Disgusting.
what's next?  Red Lobster's logo on lobsters?
He's here to end the racial tension. 
I hope they named it CM Punk. 
This LIBERAL lobster is a threat to our NATION!

To anyone that doesn't know, Alex Jones said only liberals drink Pepsi. Conservatives drink Coke. The Vegas shooter drank Pepsi and therefore it was a liberal plot against America.
For somebody who drinks so much Pepsi she looks good.

Not surprising seeing as how every fairy boat and cruise liner makes a regular practice out of dumping their "organic waste" right into the water everyday. And organic waste dumping in the ocean is not illegal it is also highly unregulated meaning obviously that they throw all their trash right into the water. Some even empty their chemical toilets.
Pepsi stepping up its advertising game. Your move, Coca-Cola. 
And he wonders why he can't find a job...
Is this harmful for the crab?


EDIT: Yup, turns out the Pepsi logo didn't hurt him, but being caught did, I bet those fishers are in Coca-Cola's payroll.
Reading this headline, I thought Pepsi had a weird new marketing campaign of tagging animals that may eventually be found by a thirsty traveler.
Finally reddit notifications pay off. 
Lets get this lobster on the Ellen show fellas. I think he'll get free Pepsi for life
These pepsi ads are getting out of ~~hand~~ claw
"Welcome to The Salty Spitoon, how tough are ya?"
Can you feel it now mr krabs
"tattooed"... I don't think that word means what you think it means.

That title gave me a mental image of a tattoo artist actually tattooing on a lobster's claw.
I think the real story here is that she drinks *twelve cans of pepsi* a day. Holy shit.
This is what's known as a "sea story". IOW, bullshit. The article briefly mentions the lobster, and her loyalty to Pepsi, followed by several paragraphs about garbage in the ocean (who knew?)

What did they do with the lobster? Has anyone with marine biology credentials looked at it? Any theories on how it got on the lobster?  Is she going to let people see it for a dollar (scientists invited, but not too close, please...  :)? 

She put the damn thing on the lobster. I can only guess why, maybe to get a free case of Pepsi, maybe to get famous, who knows? Is she related to the guy who claims to have a sasquatch in his barn? Sheesh! 


Forgive me if I’m being dense but isn’t that an image of a can, not a piece of a can, embedded in the lobster? Do Pepsi cans have pictures of Pepsi cans printed on them? Also, do those cans have cans printed on them and so on and so forth for all of eternity?
Looks like plastic from a wrapper. 
"Can I have a Coke?"

"Is Pepsi ok?"
Okay but can we talk about "drinks 12 cans of Pepsi a day"
Wouldn't this be a decal?
Was it wrong the first thought I had was "Damn, it must be cool being the first lobster with a tattoo"
> "They believe that maybe there was a can in the bottom of the ocean and when [the lobster] was growing, it grew around the can."

It's very clearly not a real can.  
It's a small picture of a can.
That is not tattooed. It’s an “imprint”
Wow I didn't know you could get lobster with Pepsi points
Normally I ignore notifications from Reddit. This one I had to check though, just to make sure my eyes weren't malfunctioning. 
I do t think the paper or ink could last that long down there under water. Something is fisny
That product placement...

yup, on my way out
I hope you guys aren’t body shaming this lobster...
I was going to say what if it was near some of those discarded plastic water decals ( I don't know the exact name but I've seen videos where they're basically these thin sheets of plastic submerged in water and when an item gets in contact with them it applies the decal on said item)
Pepsi is running out of marketing ideas
Free advertising never hurts
It's too bad they sent it to market instead of saving it to be studied. The speculations of the crew don't make much sense and, frankly, they're probably not qualified or equipped to provide any meaningful answer.
dumbest story ever.  It's part of a damn sticker.  Come on. 

>Being a huge Pepsi fan — she drinks 12 cans every day — this image would have caught her interest anywhere.


WTF. 12 cans a day?
The Lobster's gonna start making people Go To Sleep and become WWE Champion some day because it's THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
Pepsi: the official sponsor of Lobster
Looks like Pepsi has its new spokesperson!  He works for cheap, celebrity endorsers hate him!
Coke's answer to this should be an ultra rare blue American Lobster with a Coke logo on it.
So the ocean was out of Cola? 
Looks like that pepsi ad is bringing species together as well
By the jesus on grilled cheese logic, pepsi is our lord and saviour
Really needed this notification 
It’s like Charlottes Web undersea edition. 
WTF how can everyone not see that is a photograph of a Pepsi can? It's obviously a chunk of Pepsi box or something. FFS people are not very perceptive.
"this tells me there's a lot of garbage in the ocean"??? You needed to find a helpless creature with a logo grown into it's flesh to realize this?
Well maybe stop drinking 12 a day get a permanent water bottle and drink water 
What a statement. That lobster is a real hero.
Did Pepsi pay for the rights to the lobster claw??? No I dont think so. I think some lawyer should represent the lobster and sue for the advertisement. 
Welcome to New Brunswick, the Canadian province you all forget about until we pull some shit like this.
Did that lobster hold the title for 434 days?
12 cans of soda a day?!?!

Alex, What is diabetes for 2000?
How is she still living drinking 12 cans a day?!!
I loved the expert they brought in.  "The Pepsi guy that delivers Pepsi" .
Kinda really sad that no one here seems to be disgusted and saddened by this. The top comment is about how it's more unbelievable that this woman drinks 12 cans of pepsi a day. 
Does no one else think this is horrifying? 
There is SO MUCH garbage in our oceans that we have a lobster with a fucking Pepsi wrapped fused into its claw. 
That's heartbreaking. 
Between working on a lobster boat and drinking a 12 pack of pepsi/day you just know this lady likes risky behavior.
Not "imprinted,"  INGROWN.
>She drinks 12 cans every day

Lobster with a side of diabetes, anyone?
Next Level Viral Marketing From Pepsi
Your post will likely be removed if it... has a title not taken from the article.

Actual title: Grand Manan fisherman finds lobster with Pepsi can **imprinted** on claw

Quite a difference
I almost wonder if this is an ad... why so many pepsis a day? 
Pepsi's marketing department are tenderly and erotically rubbing each other's nipples because of all the free exposure they are getting.

"Hey guys, even lobsters love Pepsi more than Coke!"

Just as they were getting over the protest post orgasmic high, this happens. They'll be jizzing in your soda and you will still thank them for the new Lobster Cream flavour that results from this.

Meanwhile, Coca Cola are looking for a way to get their shit onto a dolphin, which would be quite apt because dolphins are the rapists of the sea.
Actually that’s a bepis can. 
How can we be sure it's not a Russian flag and the lobster isn't a Russian Hacker.
That’s that under da sea,  jail tatt right there! 
so, this was likely caused by one of her Pepsi cans she tosses off the fargin deck, eh?. nice. 
Someone call Kendall we need answers 
Ouuu, nice it’s from where i live!
She must have fucked up teeth 
People who litter, can 'literally' eff off. 




Oh my God, it's so sad because Pepsi is such garbage 
It is nice to see stories from NB getting out there, being noticed outside the province, but I really wish it was a story about cute cats, like a few years ago (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rudiger-the-cat-digs-out-after-snowstorm-1.2955363), rather than a story about garbage and Pepsi.
12 cans a day!? Jesus. She has to be diabetic 
If their Canadian why are they calling it soda? If Supertroopers taught me anything it was that Canadians called soda cola and they buy it by the liter.
This is so depressing.
So she definitely has diabetes and will probably be dead in a year. 
I️ was really starting to believe it until it said that she drinks 12 Pepsi cans a day
Whoever interviewed this woman and didn't tell her she's mentally ill, is a piece of shit
Now I've seen the trending posts this subreddit has had to offer. Let me tell you, THIS is news!
Im just glad i was notified this is happening /s
so she drinks 12 cans of pepsi that sound a  bit excessive 
12 cans a day!? Jesus!
"Marine debris a serious issue in New Brunswick" this sentence is awkward. It looks like they were trying to say "debris is" but thought they could use it as a contraction but then forgot to replace the i with a comma. That really bothered me. Also this is so sad :(


With 12 cans a day, there is a high probability of her being responsible for the tattoo. 
It's just infused into it which is still terrible but it's not a tattoo wtf?  This title is misleading...
idk personally when I have more than one or two sodas in a day they start to taste like shit. 
These product placement ads are getting out of hand.
Our should I say claw?
I *CAN*not believe that's true, honestly.. 




Yeah that's right, I said it 
So sad. He walked around as a child being made fun of because his hand got caught in human trash. Now he is 998 years old and this is what is left.
Why? It's only 4,380 cans per year
And she was still skinny!
Relevant [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1793/).
“Huge Pepsi fan... 12 cans a day”

I think they meant Pepsi addict
Gotta wonder if that's one of HER Pepsi cans imprinted on the lobster claw.
A 12 oz (330 mL) can of Pepsi has about 150 calories in it. That alone is 1800 calories, or about 90% of a standard 2000 calorie diet.
She looks thin/fit too. Crazy
My kidneys hurt for her.
This lady is gonna get osteoporosis or something. 
That’s only 1800 extra calories!
Actually, since commercial fishing is crazy dangerous, the lifestyle spreads to shore and they live on the edge. I wouldn't doubt that she drinks a lot of caffeinated drinks. 
I drink about 12 cans of Diet Dr Pepper a day. I'm pretty sure I'm vitrifying from the inside.
I was reading the article and exited out to make this exact comment. Wtf
I know right?, what an amateur. Only 12 cans a day.
Her teeth worry me... Borrowed time 
Thats only a woman's daily recommended caloric intake lol. She must be a sweety.
I used to be a major league Pepsi drinker. I was also fat. Coincidence?
If thats her in the picture in the article, then either she doesn't drink that much pepsi a day, or she has the worlds greatest metabolism.
Obviously she should be drinking Coke, not Pepsi 
That’s 1680 calories per day just from the Pepsi. “I just can’t understand why I can’t lose any weight!” One cool trick invented by a mom is stop drinking so much damn sugar.
I use to drink that much soda.  Have spent over 5k on dentist since then.
That read to me as send me some free Pepsi 
im so serious i cant get over it im shook
Lady in my hometown went on the "Pepsi diet" & lost a BUNCH of weight....of course, starving yourself by replacing food with corn syrup, that's a great idea!
Came to say this. 
That's surprising to you? Do you not live in America ? 
I did when I was severally depressed by my ex. I gained a lot of weight. 
Good god I just said the same thing. Maybe there is no lobster and it’s a sugary delusion. 
I'm more surprised she isn't fat
I'd rather be a heroin addict, more dignity there.
I drink between 10 and 14 cans a day, AMA.
That was all I could think about. I guess I should write the next article entitled, “Woman Drinks 12 Cans of Pepsi Everyday, Still Alive and Gainfully Employed”
Right and did you see how thin she is?? Total wtf
[removed]
Maybe in Canada they print cans on cans so that people can tell that cans are cans?
Its clearly a 2d image of a 3d can, the tab is shiny and unopened.
Wut happened was dat the lobster outgrew his shell so he saw da Pepsi can and he saw that it was good. 

So on the second day he emerged from his shell and entered himself among wut was to become his new shell, a can of Pepsi, and he saw that it was good.

On the thrightforth of wut came to be known as day, lo and beholdeth! His clampers were unable to grasp ahold of even a pebble. So he fashioned a tool in the manner of wut came to be known as a computerized numerical controller, and he fashioned the can of Pepsi into the shape of a fierce claw and he saw that it was good.

So on the fort night he came to a rest and where he layeth on the night of the fourth came to become Bikinith Bottometh.

He lived a long and full life until he layest to rest. When he was layest to rest, he had becometh the ripe age of two hundredths forty three thousandtscores and ninety of wut becometh, the day. As we would call it in our days, 243,090 days, as we are accustomed to 365 dayeth in our year.

And he becameth father to 4,561 sons and daughters. In the year 2017, his last son, Patrick Starfish, son of Phoebe Starfish, was to become King. And he acted wickedly in the eyes of his forefathers, and he did not honor his father or his mother. He defiled the land and built a tower to rise above the sea.
The second sentence literally says it's an image of a can.
It says it was from a box most likely
Looks very pixelated I'm assuming a sticker and it's a hoax.
Have you considered that it is part of a can?
Now you mention it I can't believe I took that suggestion seriously. I need more sleep.
It looks like plastic from advertising has grown into the shell. Hard to say how, but the bottom of the ocean is a dump so not hard to imagine
And I can't even get a claw back.
That would be a lot of Pepsi if lobsters were really immortal
^Up ^to ^ten ^(10) ^cans ^per ^day. ^Void ^where ^prohibited.
That lobster was obviously just trying to start a conversation and bridge the divide. 
Well done.
I'm not surprised you got more than 7up votes for this
It is, but you have to admit, this is some cola-ty ink.
Maybe the lobster thought the ladies would think it was sexy, upping his chances of being able to Mountain Dew them.
That’s perfect. 
But it really makes it pop.
Right? Glad this is considered important enough for a push notification. I don't think the last NK missile launch was given that treatment

Future diabetics.
At one point in my life I did. Well, the equivalent of 12 cans a day; I was drinking 6 24 oz bottles a day. 
Not that it's healthy by any means, but calorically speaking, working a fishing boat is hard work and she may be burning a lot more calories in a day than the typical person.
Young-mid 20s people doing physically demanding, boring work.
I work for coke and visit grocery stores daily. I see a couple in one of my stores buy 3-4 diet coke 24pks twice a week. From what they say it seems it's for personal consumption.
My uncle would down a case or two a day of Mountain Dew when he was working for them. No idea how he did that or how he is still in decent health. 
I drank two liters right and left as a child. Food was a coping mechanism. 
You would be surprised. Out in our welding shop there is a guy who drinks Mountain Dew like its his job. Could be 100+ out there and he works right next to a bubbler and he will still have a bottle or can at his desk. 
I probably drink close to 8 to 10 a day depending. But i only drink diet pepsi. I have done this my whole life pretty much. 

And im pretty healthy to. I play a shit ton of soccer and I was ranked in the top 10 in my track events across canada. 
I know, right?  Coke is the way to go.

But seriously, I drank that much a day up until about two years ago.  Then decided that I didn't want to get fat and quit.  The headaches were a bitch.
I drink about 12 cans a day. Diet and not just pepsi. I'm insane, I know. 

I'm drinking a Diet A&W Root Beer right now. Sometimes at home I'll game out for 6 hours straight and just absolutely crush diet pop. 90s music, Halo 3, diet mountain dew. That's my jam.
Lots of people in the professional world, I've learned. At my current office I think more people drink soda to get their caffeine fix than coffee, which always blows my mind because soda doesn't caffeinate me at all.

And she wouldn't give it to me, just a Pepsi
Thanks, now I'm depressed because I'm old enough to get this reference.
Pepsi has genetically modified organisms to display Pepsi ads. 
On the lobster? No. 


On Reddit’s front page? Absolutely. 
Right??!  This isn’t exactly a notification-worthy post...
The lobster?
Actually the *real story* is all the fucking trash in the ocean.
Ughh. I'd rather have a crab juice.
Maybe he just asked for a "pop" tattoo.
Apparently twelve cans.
I'm kind of craving Pepsi now...
Nope. Red Lobster's logo on a crawfish.
Is that for real?
I drink coke and heavily lean liberal. I think his logic is a little suspect... 
I live in a really conservative state and tons of people drink Pepsi. There's a Pepsi bottling plant like 30 miles away from me. A lot of restaurants around here only serve Pepsi because of this, and it's annoying, because I like Coke. 
...Drniking pepsi makes you a liberal?

Well shit apparently I've been a liberal for 25 years.
Okay, *fine,* I'll click on the article.
I've been bamboozled!
This kills the crab.
No, but being caught is.
No, it's clearly part of some packaging, not a can itself.
The fact that nobody in the story realizes this is baffling. A piece of paper from a flyer got stuck on the lobster's wet claw. That is all. 
Update your iPhone, brah
Just 31 pounds.
Considering on can of Pepsi has 41g of sugar, that's 492g of sugar per day. Only 19.68 times the daily recommend sugar intake.

That's 179,580g of sugar per year, on Pepsi alone. I fear for this woman's health.
So she can pull these kinds of stats: 3416 lbs per year of pepsi or 409 gallons.
1800 calories a day
Holy fuck that's alotta dimp 
Assuming each can cost around $1.25, that’s a total of $5,475 (ish)
That’s a lot of dough for a shitty cola 
Do you realize how much money she gets back in cans??
41g of sugar per can at 12 a day is 492 grams of sugar a day from sodas alone. Thats 179,580 grams of sugar, or 400(ish) pounds of sugar annually from her soda consumption. God damn
With approx 9 teaspoons of sugar per can that's roughly 450 lbs of sugar per year...
Just from soda...
450 lbs
She's still young and she does physically demanding work all day. Shit changes after 25 and a promotion to desk work.
she can be skinny but i bet her sugar levels are off the rails
I had a driver working for me that drank 3-4 liters of Dr. Pepper everyday and was as skinny as a crackhead.  We took bets when drug testing rolled around, but he never failed.  Some people just have the right metabolism for that I guess.
Sounds less like Pepsi and more like coke!
I used to down similar amounts in my teens. Age was a huge factor obviously, but I stayed relatively skinny. Instant six pack once I finally quit though.
I was able to drink 3-4 liters of pepsi a day when in my early 20s. I ran everywhere I went and had a job where I was on my feet all the time. Even with a diet of just cola and breadsticks I was able to stay at 160lbs at 6'4. Just gotta stay active.
No fisher(wo)man in the world gets by on 2000kcal a day.
Unless the article was just imprecise and she drinks Diet Pepsi. It'd be bad for her teeth, but it has zero calories and zero sugar.

Fishing is fairly strenuous. You need to be fit to do it, really
I drink about a gallon of tea daily. I don't drink water, fish fuck in it you know. 
Brother! I drink roughly a six pack of the 16.9s a day, you got me beat but still people look at me crazy and my excuse is "I don't drink coffee so gotta have atleast 2 to wake up" the stores know what's going down when they have 4/10 (this week) I'ma go in there walk out with 100 dollars poorer but a happy man.
Wish I could do that.  Just one can makes my heart race.  Doctor banned aspartame and splenda from my life because my body reacts badly to it like a type of allergy. Either of those are usually used in most diet drinks. I can only drink those containing regular sugar, HFCS, or unsweetened drinks (milk, tea and coffee for example)
Then stop drinking so much of it. If it's about caffiene then switch to coffee. 
Not to mention the size of the hand in the picture. The can would have to be tiny. 
Yes if you read the article it says they believe it was an image from a Pepsi box or something similar 
I can't imagine
I thought they sold there pepsi in a bag in Canada.
In the article, they had a theory about a can falling into the water and the claw growing around it. 
I bestoweth up on ye sumdat "virtual" gold.  Behold my cheap and miserly ways.
Bravo. Upvoteth
"Fisherman, as a sign of good will, I come bearing the mark of peaceful communication. I am but a poor lobster, and cannot afford the sweet beverage... But I hope this gesture is pleasing to you, and that you will no longer hunt my people" 
But he got way more th—*ooooooooh*.
Can confirm it wasn't
But luckily the translucent lobster is one in 100 million.
Untill they're former diabetics. 
Back in high school I used to drink 300 cans of Slurm a week! Right up until my third heart attack.
Where do you get 24oz bottles of Soda? They usually go 12oz -> 16oz -> 16.9oz (500ml) -> 20oz -> 1L.
Sounds about right, eight 24 packs will just scrape my wife and I by for two weeks if we go light the second week.
Can you hook a brotha up with some coke cap codes? TIA
It seems almost everyone who drinks Mt. Dew does so religiously. There's got to be something extremely addictive in there because it's too nasty to just be a preference.
Yeah I used to as well.  As a kid I felt like nothing mattered, since we're all gonna die and be in pain eventually.  I also felt like I deserved my depression because I ate so bad, I must have been a bad person.  These days I have a healthier outlook, but I'm still working off those pounds I put on through grade 6-12.  
Am 22, still checks out :| goooo fast metabolism
Man... So true, that withdrawal is insane when one decides to get off the bandwagon. I used to be a heavy soda drinker in my teenage years and early twenties. Then I stopped, it was a rough week of headaches and weird twitches. Scary shit.
How are your teeth?
Doesn't the aspartame in diet pop make you super thirsty?
Coke tastes good and goes with everything. Coffee can be hit or miss with people and goes good with basically nothing. If im munching on food all day I'm going to want some coke.
Papa Gino's is literally the only thing I miss about the north
I'm not crazy!
I'm not sure about you, but this has made me pretty crabby. 
Wait what is this from?
You must also have Khlav Kalash.
this is probably unrelated... but I had Panda Express for lunch today.  As I was eating, I stared at the Panda Express logo on the wall and I wondered "what do pandas taste like?" :(   
Doesn’t it make you sad that you have to ask
>ALEX JONES (HOST): He drank Pepsi. And again liberals, I mean literally conservatives do not drink -- especially in the Obama era -- conservatives drink Coca-Cola, if you drink soft drinks, liberals drink Pepsi. That’s a big clue.

You wouldn't lean so heavy if you laid off the pop.
Pepsi=blue and Coke=red ??
So who's this mystery woman drinking all this soda?  Tell me so i don't have to click!
Ouch

~~I was asking about the claw, like.. it does harm him~~
At 4380 cans a year and 170 calories per can and 3500 cals/lb of bodyfat thats 212.74lbs of extra fat gain per year


r/theydidthemath
31 pounds for thousands of Pepsi's? How much USD?
Uhh a single can weighs almost a pound (.8 pounds) so more like 3500 pounds
31 pounds of what 
Yeah but how many fluid ounces? 
Not sure what you are referring to, 12 cans is 9 pounds.
31 pounds of sugar? I feel like 4000+ cans of Pepsi is more than 30 lbs
That's incrediblly cheap for a whole years worth
just 396 pounds of sugar per year
maybe shes a mutant that is immune to sugar?
> That's 179,580g of sugar per year, on Pepsi alone. I fear for this woman's health.

Something tells me shes one of those people who doesn't care.  Diabetes or health be damned - people won't change even when they have to.
That's right where my head went as well! That's insane!
> 492g of sugar per day

That's over a pound, Americans. That is scary and mind-boggling.
[deleted]
What if she's just drinking really tiny cans.
Can confirm, 26 and work in IT now.
[deleted]
Diet Pepsi. She's one of the few and brave. 
TIL: Dr. Pepper removes all traces of crack in system.
Doesnt mean its not damaging him/herself
My college roomate was like this drank cases of DP like water was rail thin and drove his car to get quesadillas a block away. I on the other hand avoided sugar like the plague and walked my ass everywhere and hit the gym every other day I weighed twice what he did.
>  Some people just have the right metabolism for that I guess.

It's not their metabolism.  Metabolism doesn't vary that widely for people of the same weight.  

Edit: Good lord people, [it's a fact](https://examine.com/nutrition/does-metabolism-vary-between-two-people/).  Just stop with the "other people are skinnier because of their metabolism" nonsense. 

>  The majority of the population exists in a range of 200-300kcal from each other and do not possess hugely different metabolic rates.
I met this British dude who only drank Pepsi, like that was the only thing he drank. The dude was really skinny but had the hobo ab thing going, I don't know how long it will last for him, but I wish him the best

My boyfriend drinks like four or five of those 16oz Monster drinks every day, and being almost 40 now, it's starting to catch up with him. Tall and skinny guy, but has been developing a bit of a gut now. :-/

As someone who lives off of water and coffee with no sugar, I can't comprehend this kind of abuse towards sugary drinks. I mean, a 12oz can of soda has at least 40g of sugar. No one should be consuming any more than that in a day.
>I had a driver working for me that drank 3-4 liters of Dr. Pepper everyday and was as skinny as a crackhead.

I love Reddit anecdotes
My best guy friend is like this. Super skinny and drinks a dozen cans of Coke a day. He's hit mid 20s and his metabolism is already slowing and he's getting a gut. :/
Also, meth leaves your system pretty quickly. 
this guy rides the rails.  
>instant six pack once I finally quit though

... that's not how that works
That kind of lifestyle is extremely unhealthy, doesn’t matter if you’re thin or not. 
I literally can’t run anywhere without wanting to puke if I drink soda 3-4 hours before working out. 
That doesnt mean 21600 calories a day is healthy either. 
What about stevia? Aspartame gives me headaches so I try to avoid it. Zevia has a stevia Dr. Pepper clone, I don't like but I don't like regular Dr. Pepper either. Their cream soda and root beer aren't bad. That and La Croix take care of my carbonated drink cravings.
This was caught in Grand Manan, NB, Canada
Not too far from where I live, it’s a wrapper from a Pepsi bottle which somehow fused into the claw as it was developing 
Its also at an angle where you can see that the "top" is unopened
Yes, you can!
It just looks so pristine and clean, how would it mold to a claw over time and still look so shiny and clean?  It would have to mold to his claw starting as a full can of soda, I just don't see how it sticks and molds like that over time.
Well whoever came up with that theory should hand in their science-ing license.

Back when I was drinking them, they were more popular. Almost all grocery stores had the 24 oz bottles. 

These days I can only find them at Sam's Club. 
My job is to make sure the soda gets sold, not break it open.
Maybe its the 70 grams of sugar. 
Am 23 fast metabolism was nice, can you share?
No, I drink mostly just diet pop on regular days (sometimes I have beer and other drinks, but not normally). A little bit of water here and there, but probably like 3+ litres of diet pop and 0.5 litres of water.

I never thought about it, but diet pop seems to only temporarily quench my thirst, so that's probably part of why I drink so much. I drink a can and get thirsty again. It definitely quenches my thirst while drinking it though.
You're on drugs!

Fuck me, maybe it really was all satire.
The Charlottesville guy from UNR disproves this. UNR only carries Pepsi so he definitely drank Pepsi
Hello fellow mid-westerner. 
She looks good. 

Especially considering her diet.
And yet she seems in really good shape. I can only assume working on that boat burns 2,000 calories a day at least, which would be equal to what? 5 hours of cycling?
[deleted]
> 170 calories per can

To put this in perspective, that's slightly more calories than two shot glasses filled to the brim with maple syrup.
/r/theydidthefuckyou
r/theydidthemonstermath
It's less than the amount of feet in a mile.
I think the math is probably a off + or - a few thousand pounds.. 

I did not 'didthemarh'
They did not do the math. 12 cans is 9 pounds.
Bout $3.50
/r/shittyaskscience
I think he was referring to the amount of sugar, not the actual weight of a full can.

(Edit: Right, not the sugar then...)
For a 12 oz. can that's 52,560 fluid ounces a year. 
From the photo in the article she's pretty thin, she probably burns tons of calories working on a fishing boat.  

A lot of people don't realize that excess sugar consumption can lead to Type 2 diabetes and other problems even if you're not fat.
I developed diabetes, took responsibility for my role in it & changed.  I lost 70 lbs & my A1C is down to prediabetic level.  That being said, 12 cans of any soda is gross.  I love that internet peeps pretend to care about her health but are really passing judgement.  
That's over .07 stone, Britons. That's a scary and mind-boggling system of measurement.
I hate to say it but the article seems to indicate she's in Canada
Could be diet (and yes I know that’s not healthy either) 
Can confirm your confirmation, went from bartending to IT at 26 and have been cultivating mass ever since (36 now)
27 and I do IT work. I gained 20 pounds when I switched to desk work.
...Captain's log?

But seriously, I was thinking more like the logistical jobs those companies often have ashore. There's usually an office with some managers doing all the boring shit for permits, bids, etc so the people on the boat can get paid their money to do the dangerous shit.
Probation officers hate this one simple trick!

Thank you. The only outliers I can think of would be people with thyroid issues. 
Hobo ab?
The amount of caffeine he's consuming is the more immediate issue. Please get him to tell you if he ever has chest pains or a sudden shortness of breath.
More like he's been slowly gaining weight this whole time.
/shrug

Not sure what you mean. I was thin and athletic, when I quit soda the last bits of belly fat faded away real quick. Don't know how you think a six pack works, but this is what happened.
Especially with soda but you'd be surprised what kind of shit athletes eat just because easy calories are needed when you have to meet 4000+ calories a day to stay ahead of the game.

Even in really healthy acitivities like backpacking. Wilderness backpackers eat like garbage. Thru hikers on the PCT eat even worse. I met a guy at his 2000th mile. He said 98% of his diet for those 5 months were peanut m&ms, chocolate bars and olive oil. His only real meals came from the occasional in-town restaurant. Healthiest looking dude I ever met but he was only 28 and had never stopped being athletic. We'll see how it catches up if he's still doing that in 5 years..
Yeah that kind of thing doesnt show at first... but a couple decades down the road.......
Back then I had a stomach of steel. I would definitely not want to drink carbonated anything and run nowadays.

Well you’d have to wouldn’t you? Other than the calories, there’s no nutrients in Pepsi 
You are for sure a fire truck
r/itwasagraveyardgraph
It's less than the 10.82 miles of dick that guys girlfriend took over 2 years lol
But more than the amount of half miles in a mile
That's 492g or 0.95 lbs per day, so it's definitely not pounds if sugar per year.
> A lot of people don't realize that excess sugar consumption can lead to Type 2 diabetes and other problems even if you're not fat.

Just like people with thick necks but aren't thick elsewhere can get sleep apnea.  There's lots of caveats when it comes to health.  

Being thin doesn't always mean being healthy, but still.
I'm only passing judgement; I don't care about her health.
Yes. I was just translating the metric into units Americans would understand.
Hit the gym if you want to stop cultivating mass!! Unless you're happy that way
27 and I just do desk work. I've gained over 30 pounds in the past two years and I hate myself for it.

I too took community college biology
And even those aren't always a huge difference, I believe.  

Highly unlikely that they cover 3-4 LITERS of Dr Pepper(1200-1600 calories).

Trust me, I'm already concerned but he's too damn stubborn..
yeah, really. any time (the all of twice) I've had one of those energy drinks, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, as my left arm started hurting.

I have to take BP meds though, and have been hypertensive since I was a teenager due to the fact I lost every single genetic lottery I could (asthma, gilbert's syndrome, high BP, even had severe necrotic pancreatits that had no known cause except for bad genetics, not to mention the flat feet and poor eyesight)

but yeah, sounds like this guy needs to get his blood pressure checked for starters. I think the problem is there are so many people that never move (or have a hard time) past the teenage mindset of thinking you're invincible and it takes something serious to snap people out of it.
Didn't Usain Bolt eat a shit ton of McNuggets as a pregame for the last Olympics? Lol
It's not even that. It's a very imbalanced diet that would easily lead to dangerous nutrient deficiencies.

The best you can do is to encourage him to see a doctor if you see any signs of heart issues. I was the same exact way and I was even ignoring sharp pain in my chest and arms. I went to the doctor for a shortness of breath that I thought was my asthma or a lung infection. I quit after my doctor scared the crap out me by pointing that I had a hearth murmur and an inflamed liver from excessive Vitamin B3. That's from drinking 3 of those white can Monster Ultras every single day for a couple years.
I believe you mean 'stupid' not 'stubborn'.

The irony is crisp and refreshing.
Yes, buy pepsi and use it as a weapon!  Use coupon code #ORDER66 at checkout
Anarchists always providing a touch of wit with their chaos. 
They should probably hurl them at Kendall Jenner instead
It'd be one thing if they were throwing cans of coke, but Pepsi? That's just tasteless.
That's about all that Pepsi is worth for.  Except wild cherry.  
Antifa are pretty dumb, I saw a video of them get their flag stolen and instantly cry for the cops to help them lol

Morons. They should be smart:  become rich and bribe the government to inflict pain on people.
Don't they know they have to hand the sodas to police?
I would love it if the riot police could make their tear gas canisters look like cans of pepsi. 
And the only winner is Pepsi
That degenerated quickly.
When police show up to a peaceful protest in riot gear, it changes the tone. It doesn't exactly make protesters feel safe when they are in fucking tanks brandishing firearms.

Ahh Pepsi, the official drink of protests.
Holy shit, these ads are generating so many sales.  
That sounds premeditated.
How did we not expect this?
I can't tell the article doesn't make it clear. Was this the protestors or the people opposing the protestors. From the article it seems like there were two different groups one peaceful one violent.
I think this is the message Pepsi was trying to get across.
While this is mildly amusing, hurling *anything* at cops is a seriously stupid idea.  The moment you turn violent, you lose the respect and support of every rational human being.
I bet Pepsi already has a a crack team of corporate lawyers at the ready. You *know* someone is going to try to make that connection.
I wonder if this will have any ramifications for Pepsi?
This must be another Wesen thing.
>Police eventually declared the march a riot and canceled its permit at 4:30 p.m., ordering attendees to disperse. Police threatened to arrest anyone in the streets after the permit was canceled early in the evening.

So people getting off work or needing to go somewhere just had to stay put for the night?
Let them fucking be Jesus fuck. They're doing their job, yeah some of them are fucked, but so are a lot of you. Go throw Pepsi at the people who fuck things up.
I heard the cans were empty so it's okay though. If they were full they could explode and hurt the policemen

Because people are now buying Pepsi to throw at cops?

Guess it doesn't matter as long as they are buying it.
If they somehow managed to make it the cola of protests, they've won the battle.
Well... those protesters did buy pepsi just to throw at the police.  That's pepsi that wouldn't have been sold otherwise!  
I have their same reaction whenever I see the Kardashians on TV as well.
It's more of a "make 7 up yours" message though :p
You are on this shopping list. But we do not grant you the rank of beverage.
Portlandians don't believe in capitalism enough to buy things
Think Pepsi Max (diet pepsi) sells the most out of any large soda here in Norway, though Coke is close.
I prefer pepsi to coke...and wish holiday spice would come back...
they're anarchists... probably got the 5-finger discount
Nah, They throw Molotov cocktails too...

Also, there were no tanks there.....
Well if these anarchists or whatever didn't have a history of getting violent it wouldn't be a concern. Also, what do you mean by tank?

I'm sure there's a point in there somewhere, but honestly I can't find it.
Have you ever been in a Demo? One where suddenly the Police turn from people in hi vis gear helping people to rows of tooled up and armoured thugs, you don't know whats happening a mile up the road, you can't see anything in the crowd past 100 yards and suddenly those armoured people are chucking tear gas at you and then pile in with truncheons?

Are you just supposed to stand there and accept your punishment?
Indeed. Now when I buy a case of Pepsi, I'll end up on a watch list. 
it's was an insultingly patronizing message, I think is why people are salty over it
it was a horrible commercial, and people took notice 
It was an insulting image. Protests are not a fun day out with your friends, we are not friends with cops, and fucking Pepsi is not the solution. Fuck off with that bullshit

It's a group of individuals that show up to all of the peaceful protests and use them as an excuse to riot. They don't have a cause, they are just idiots.  
What if they don't want to be Jesus?
What kind of Pepsi do you drink?!?!?

Sadly that's probably close to how it went. Marketing cares about showing increased sales figure, PR is left to clean up the mess.

Sales are sales.

From my point of view Coca-Cola is evil!

(Im Canadian, never seen Holiday Spice)
I also prefer Pepsi and loved Holiday Spice. I try not to drink much pop now though.
I prefer either but Wild Cherry Pepsi is far superior to Cherry Coke.
Meanwhile, here I am, despising cola drinks and only drinking Canada Dry...
The police claimed this, but at no point has there been corroboration from the ground that even one Molotov was used, though many roadflares were.
Nah, they had roadflares and fireworks but no cocktails.

"attacked"

you mean they jumped to a conclusion, then calmly talked to him and everything worked out. good on him for being calm and rational, bad on you for hyping shit up about libtards. The guy apologized even. This was like the best example of humans having a nice conversation about their views

No this is hilarious 
Not only do you get hit hard with something a comparable in weight to a baseball but it then showers you and your fellows with sugar while you're wearing black on a hot day. I don't condone it, but seems an effective way to demoralize someone and make them absolutely despise you and your 'cause'. Violent protest has always served to delegitimize public demonstrations/peaceful protest. 

Editing this because people have made solid points. Violent actions on the micro level for no cause at a peaceful protest can serve to delegitimize a peaceful demonstration/movement/cause to those that are reactionary and seek to dismiss the protest as a whole for the actions of the few. On a macro level if violence is threatened for a just cause I could see positive outcomes if people understood the complexities of modern society but.... yeah America can be pretty heavily ignorant and simultaneously too arrogant to listen to opposition 
Counterpoint: It's still fucking hilarious 
That actually does sound hilarious.

You do realize that people in Antifa tend to use 'liberal' as an insult, right?
One of the ways the fascists came to power in Italy was by convincing the Italian people that their party was the only way to get rid of the anarchists and anti fascists. 


[removed]
Nazism was in large part a reaction to decades of Communism in European politics. Rather then react to your conservative family's natural disgust at Antifa you should instead fight and shame Antifa into submission before what comes next after the Alt-Right makes this political violence worse. 
Well they kind of stab a lot of people so...
Time to start making some arrests. Also, we need to start passing more anti-mask laws so that violent demonstrators can be idwntified.
Best fucking comment ever

And a lobotomy. 
Why does that happen though? Why do police suddenly go from policing to "chucking tear gas?" 

Is this stuff that happens during riots? Is it provoked or not? I haven't been to many protests, but none have turned into riots. Are the police supposed to stand there and be assaulted, watch cities burn, etc?

I think the problem is "us vs them". And the acceptance of violence vs "the other." 
serves you right
Then throw Pepsi at them.
I get the reglar Pepsi. You can buy it anywhere around here and should be able to there. Just look in grocery store sections.

Diet Coke, with a straw, will always be the drink of choice for 20 something blondes...
yeah, pepsi products are ubiquitous enough that i doubt someto college students buying a few twelve packs correlates to an increase in pepsi sales, certainly not enough to counteract bad press
It's possible they were stolen as well. 
Who gives a shit? The goal is more sales.
And so niche too.  That's easily a less than 1% joke because of age, niche interest ARPG, and difficulty to access that item in the game itself.

The police took sides LONG before this ever happened. 
Just like those violent Boston tea party members who assaulted fish with tea leaves or those pesky civil rights marchers who were all about throwing dogs and water cannons at themselves. The police have been violently oppressing the people for quite a while, but if the people push back suddenly it's delegitimizing? The power dynamic between the people and the police is fucked, worrying about manners is a stupid way to distract from real problems. Realize that the media has and will try to paint protesters as shit starters as opposed to people making a political statement because it benefits their narrative. 
TL;DR Your statement that violent protest has always served to delegitimize a movement is historically incorrect.
Every significant advance in civil rights featured the threat of violence. Pacifism is a trick whites play on poor people. 
My favorite (not from the book AFAIK) was some UK anarchists canvasing for homeless folk to crash upscale events like art auctions for the catering.

Yeah you see this in a lot of groups. At t_d they often call their opponents "cry-bullies." That's an interesting manifestation of this mentality, they are at once calling their opponents weak and childish but also describing themselves as victims of bullying by them.
The anti-logic folks don't seem to understand how to elicit sympathy, even when  that gremlin got punched by the nazi in Berkeley it was more funny than not.

"Liberals get the bullet too"
You do realize antifa are, like Bike Lock Guy,  just progressives and liberals dressed up so they can pretend it's some other mythical group of people doing all the wrongs, right?
They're "left" of the far right, which is good enough for some.

Same way that antifa thinks everything "right" of them is literally Hitler.
This is what fascists do. This and pretend they are for the people/workers and pretend they are socialist. They fight fucking dirty.
You'd think that at some point in all their overpriced social-studies classes these LARPers would've taken a modern world history class and would know that they're doing the exact things the Nazis et. al. pointed to as the reason they needed power.
Do you have a source for that? If not stop making up shit to push your agenda. 
They generally think even Bernie Sanders is a tool of Wall Street and say "liberals get the bullet too".

It's not entirely unwarranted. Look up what happened to Rosa Luxemburg.
I agree that they are only helping to push the Right further. 
One of the Trumpies took a machete to Democrats in Kentucky just last week. 
And the KKK has a bad history too. Not mention the right-wing terrorist attacks we've been seeing the past few years are also frowned upon. Actually the last major incident with Antifa was when one got shot by a conservative that premeditated it. Assholes have a tendency of making our respective sides look bad. 
I've never been to a protest, but have seriously considered going with a mask. I'm non-violent, have no intention of committing crimes, not antifa (as far as within an active group, though I sympathize with their overall message)

I just don't want my identity being used against me. I have intentions to start dialogues, and don't need my identity dug up for t_d if anything is posted online. I'm a small white girl, and doubt that the police would target me for anything, but if a mask is the only thing raising concerns, then I'm happy to provide ID

Otherwise it's no one's business, right? I understand the argument and concern, but am I unjustified in my own? I'm really not looking for a fight here, I'm legitimately curious why this might not be solid reasoning

Also considering other religious reasons, I find this kind of thinking worrisome, but again, I'm totally open to discussion here
[removed]
The point I am making is that most of the time when it goes bad, you have no idea from where you are, why it does.

I have seen first hand the arbitrary violence the Police can dish out at a demo, most of them are as scared as everyone else, some of them are just arseholes who like hurting people and lash out because they can. They though at least have a good chain of communication are informed of what is happening.

Lets take another example Kettling.

Your on a demo something you really believe in and suddenly your hemmed in on all sides by the Police, you've done nothing violent, your exercising your rights.

They keep you trapped there for hours with NO explanation.

Two hours in you need to piss you need to shit you have no water no food, ask to be let go, you'll probably be told to fuck off, you might even get grabbed and arrested. No ones telling you why your trapped, and to ask is to be punished. DO you think you MIGHT start to get a little pissed off? Or are you just going to stay there and accept it?

edit: DOn't get me wrong I am well aware there are people in the crowd who are there simply to fight or start chaos (and sometimes that's also the Police)

The Boston Tea party was a precursor to a large scale war with a major world power. This is in no way relatable to that, and further pushes liberals like myself away from supporting that cause.
Those awful police, trying to keep the antifa douchebags from breaking other people's stuff. 
Your second point didn't make any sense. The civil Rights marchers were peaceful despite getting water cannons and dogs thrown at them. If these little shits were breaking your stuff would you just go 'oh well, it's for a good cause' or would you want to beat the hell out of them?
Not always. It was a poor choice of words on my part. But it will often provide justification for those seeking to delegitimize your cause if you or people associated with you are perceived as targeting the innocent. I understand the thorough mainstream corruption, but I still believe violence is not the answer. The threat of it is sometimes needed, sometimes more, but I want it to be the last option not the first
Framing conversations as "whites vs poor people" is also a weird trick to play on anyone.
It's not white vs black. It's the people vs the government. 

Racial divides only serve to hurt the cause of revolutionizing the shit show we have in the US right now. 
Oh I understand the importance of violent protest and revolution. However it's arbitrary and often subjective to declare one violent action just and one unjust especially when innocents and those just doing their jobs are the targets. If antifa actually wanted to use violence to make change target ceos families and they'd listen immediately, they don't care if you shower public servicemen with pepsi. To be clear I do not condone these actions, there are still many ways in which America can change that don't include violence

Nobody will acknowledge this if its more convenient to call Antifa "Liberals" or "the left".
Antifa originated in West European countries like Germany and France, they largely came from socialist parties.

There are very few Antifa in the USA, it's a recent trend in the Americas where's they've been around a good few decades in Europe and are much more refined.
Bullshit.  They are mostly anarcho-communists, which is why the colors are red and black.  Some of them are serious, some of them are LARPing 1930s Spanish partisans.
They are anarchist, not liberals. I'm not sure you actually know what 'liberal' means.

Funny how the entire left was overjoyed to compare conservative politicians and voters to the KKK and Hitler's NAZI party. Now they cry foul and claim they have nothing to do with violent protests. Which, by the way have not all been done by antifa, but many by mainstream leftists too. And none have been met with much protest from the left either.

Didn't they have a shootout with each other in Seattle?

Edit: the fact that you have to counterpoint their actions with the fucking KKK kind of prooves me right 
KKK was a democrat movement.
The law has to protect everyone. If people can use public anonymity to  commit violent crimes with impunity, then we have to take away public anonymity.

Antifa is getting away with wearing masks so that they can use violence to intimidate people because they're operating in states that didn't have widespread issues with the KKK. States that have had a lot of problems with groups like the Klan and Antifa in the past do have anti mask laws.

Saying that you should be allowed to wear a mask because you don't intend to commit crimes is like me saying that I should be allowed to drive an unregistered car because I didn't steal it and I make sure that it's compliant with emissions laws. The fact is, my intentions are irrelevant because the law isn't aimed at me. The law is necessary in order to help prevent car theft and to ensure that other cars are safe and don't pollute too much.
I'm being honest we can get them here all over

Civilization is founded on the mutual surrender of our option of using force on each other, and handing that right to an impatial entity, the state.

This frees us from the trap of being forced into conflict with our neighbours even if neither of us wills it, simply to make ourselves safer.

Civilization isn't perfect, but it's far far better than anarchy. If you're one of those people who thinks we would all live in harmony without laws, you are deluded. Whenever civilization collapses, orgies of violence ensue.
>Why do you pay rent? So that you dont get evicted. Why don't you just resist eviction? Cause the government has a monopoly on violence within its borders.

Well, you don't need a monopoly to provide that. It could just be calling friends to show up with bats as well (or in a nicer country, a private police force).

The idea that Black Americans just held their hands and sang kumbaya to throw off the oppressive chains of Jim Crow is some white washed bullshit that is 100% false.
You have to do some of your own deeper research into the era and the history of protests in America in general. I recommend a people's history of the US, it has lots of examples that will make my sloppy pre coffee statement make more sense.

Yet there's tons at these protests. That's my whole point - "antifa" is now a 'no true liberal' bullshit thing these animals use to get away with crimes and yet get to claim that progressives have nothing to do with it. Anyone can put on a fucking blackshirt and hit people with bike locks and claim 'oh those aren't *true* progressives!'. Yeah, they just *happen* to be at every single anti-Trump march, and just *happen* to be entirely focused at trying to kill conservatives, even though liberals keep claiming they hate liberals equally.
It's easier to win an argument if you just make up what the other side says.
I mean, they call themselves "anti-fascists" and go around beating people who must be fascists because why else would they be getting beaten by anti-fascists.

It's not exactly putting words in their mouth.
You're making a strawman argument.

I never said both sides were alike, I just mentioned 1 point of similarity.
Right, so antifa and most anarchists don't like liberals.
> Funny how the entire left was overjoyed to compare conservative politicians and voters to the KKK and Hitler's NAZI party.

Its not like Trump took a page out of Hitler's book OH WAIT. That exactly what VOICE is. Its not like he has an advisor thats wearing a nazi medal at all times OH WAIT THATS GORKA.
Not that I've read. A woman and her boyfriend went to the protest with intentions to get into fights and she shot a dude for no reason. As for your edit, prove you right how? That Antifa sucks? I mentioned that. What the fuck was your other point? That only the Left is violent? 
No it doesn't. It might not be a valid argument, but you are ALSO wrong.

Of course liberals are terrified of the idea of black people throwing any more chains off.
Yeah, and every time they tried that what happened? They were killed, arrested, and in some cases much worse. MLK had a successful civil rights movement (unlike separatists like Malcom X) because he used nonviolence in conjunction with events such as the Vietnam war to channel his message to the nation, and of course concerned white people. Do you really think that 1960's America even gave half a shit about violent protesters? No, the police and national guard stomped them regularly, and stomped on people who were nonviolent as well.

Like I said, I know plenty.
I don't condone violence. I literally said it, it's been made clear. I'm saying the antifi protesters are mistaken if they think being violent to the police of America will cause any positive change, but would be more successful if targeting individuals who have real power over legislation formation and target those they love. I'm saying if you're going to be a political terrorist at least be competent about it. But may I repeat I do not condone violent actions so I would be just as against them doing that as throwing cans of pepsi at police I'm just trying to discuss the subject. Put the pitch fork away
Literally all political systems use threat of violence for enforcement. Liberalism literally hires police officers to beat the shit out of people and enforce order.

If he doesnt agree with violence, he really needs to stop paying taxes. 

What does he think the CIA does? Sunshine and rainbows?
They can form an Anarchist party to bring about social changes from within. lol that just felt hilarious to type. If Anarchy is what you truly seek form a new Anarchist state in the Antarctic

[deleted]
As for skinheads you do have SHARP who have previously been involved with Antifa.

Most at the protests aren't Antifa, again they are new and rather small in the Americas.They also aren't trying to kill conservatives, it's specifically the physical opposition of fascists. The people at these rallies are goose stepping Nazis.

As for why they don't attack liberals, that's becasue liberals tend to be non violent. Fascism on the other hand inherently teaches and endorses violence against others. It's an ideology that always leads to more violence for it's a key tenet of that ideology.


When did anyone say that progressives have nothing to do with it? The difference between those you are describing within Antifa and your "run-of-the-mill" liberal is the fact of being an extremist or non-extremist.

Not all of those within Antifa want to kill conservatives. Just like not all of those who prescribe to the alt-right belief system want to kill liberals.

You see the exact same stuff on all sides. You're not being truthful when you say 'all of group x does y'. I'm sure you'd argue that not all people who oppose extremism in BLM or social justice are racist, by which you'd be absolutely right. The most vocal/strange/angry of a group tend to be the minority, yet news and media paint the entirety with these outliers.

I'm not saying that Antifa doesn't have a great amount of these types of people, because it does, but not all of Antifa are protesters or extremists.
I got yer straw, where do ya want it?
That sentence can be directed both ways and it'd still be true.

Saying this from an outside perspective.
I'm a socialist.
Real Nazi's exist, but as long as they are loud, and allowed to be loud then they will never have power and never actually be taken seriously.  You can't run them out to the sea without getting them more sympathy.  Extremists typically die by suicide over time.
No, I don't pay any attention to KKK or nazis, and certainly don't allow them to influence my political stances. The only time I ever hear from them is when the regressive left insist on giving them air time and trying to make them relevant.

If they cause anybody any problems, any bullying, violence, intimidation, or anything remotely like antifa and the regressive left has done, crush them. Otherwise I ignore them.

Take your pills and go to bed, Screechy.

Well you kind of implied that concerns about Antifa was alt right bullshit
It is horrible you are right. They can explode just as strong as marine hand grenades and cause blood loss
Deus Vultage
Cool Reich
Does it taste better than that godawful Dew S A flavor they just put out?
I'm sure the CEOs are starving
Go back to your wretched hive of scum and villainy, prequel memers.

And it's the best soda ever made. 
Mannnn, I'm so jonesing for the T-A-B right now.
"Is Pepsi ok?"
"Why would it be?"
>defiantly 

Your point is invalid
Defiantly, yes
Was it regional? Might also be that I hate Pepsi, tastes like shitty coke imo.
I'm not advocating violence against the police because they are just as much pawns in this oligarchical game of thrones as the rest of us.
Change liberals with neoliberals and establishment cronies and yes you are very correct 
> MLK had a successful civil rights movement (unlike separatists like Malcom X) because he used nonviolence

Sorry, but you don't get to separate the two. The rioting was part and parcel of the whole movement. If they didn't exist, MLK's peaceful movement wouldn't have gone anywhere.
Liberals can get it too
If I didn't have to pay taxes sure, I'd quit cold turkey. I don't condone the actions of the independent terrorist state that is our own CIA. But I'm an American god damnit and I'm going to try my best to, through political action and education keep our shit ship from sinking. Vote in the god damned local elections and organise for change, don't promote violence to any individual trump supporter, police, antifa, actual fascists. I don't give a fuck who or what you are just respect the planet and your fellow man enough to strive for better
A stateless society would require a global scale catastrophe where all social structures first break down to form. That's really the only way I can envision a successful Anarchist state if one at all
People would know if someone was trying to pass off Pepsi as Coke.

One tastes like vomit mixed with blood and battery acid.

And the other tastes like Coke.
Just stuff it in this here black hoodie labelled "ANTIFAS ARE FASCISTS" 
*And none have been met with much protest from the left either.*


*No, I don't pay any attention to KKK or nazis*


Hypocracy much? Yawn.
I didn't intend to, they are indeed cunts, it's just that I don't see the dangerous radicalization occurring on the left as I do on the right. The left has for the past few years gone retarded too with the policing of speech, safe-space bullshit, but a lot of Americans are openly embracing fascism (and by a lot, I don't mean just fringe elements on college campuses, I'm talking middle class family homes) The insane shit I'm hearing my family spout out is indeed troubling. The rise of genuine right-wing terrorism the past several years also attests to this. The stabbing by what appears to be an antifa supporter on campus is not promising either. 
You're a mental or a wind up merchant, probably a mental wind up merchant

Well waddaya know?

Probably not the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise.
And it mixes really well with berries that have been soaked in 80 proof moonshine whiskey.
Was it ever?
I'm pretty sure it was national. I wiki'd it and it was sold during the holiday season in 2004 and 2006.
It was national. 

It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. 
I wonder how much of that is your actual opinion and how much is the fact that you think whatever the circle jerk tells you to think. 

And by I wonder I mean I know the answer 
And I'll say the same thing about those rioters as I will about any other rioters in the day and age who think it's alright to destroy other people's property: they can get fucked, hard, and preferably thrown in jail afterwards.
I'm a leftist, there's literally no mechanism within liberal/capitalist government to achieve a classless society. Protesting and demanding things like direct democracy or wealth redistribution is the most effective method of praxis.

I refuse to respect people who campaign for ethnic cleansing, and believe they should be denied a platform by the citizenry, since the community is the most effective tool police tolerance.

There's nothing about intolerance that prescribes pacifism, tolerance is not a death sentence.
If this would occur, there is no reason to believe humans would not repeat what humans have done throughout our history. Create class structures. The idea of an anarchist state (as in state of being, not the formal State) would be a new venture for humans regression is not guaranteed in the least to produce. 
They aren't out there bashing people in public and shutting down people speaking and associating.

You really have no idea what's going on, do you grandpa? There's communists under your bed, nazis hiding in your closet, and the KKK out the front of your house burning their crosses in your little world, aren't there? You're a big brave nazi hunter, aren't you gramps?

I don't understand I'm sorry 
It's all my own opinion, I used to drink pepsi regularly but a few years ago stopped enjoying the taste
Yeah, that makes sense. Law and order is WAY more important than the fact that people were being murdered for trying to exercise their rights. They should've just politely accepted their lot and just tried to vote the problems away. Oh wait...
I'd give you gold if I could, thank you for your perspective I agree with your sentiment. But should the citizenry not fight the intolerance with education instead of soda cans? It's hard sometimes impossible to beat intolerance out of a person. You have to educate/reason it out of them if that makes sense

Did anyone stop to consider whether, in fact, Sucralose is possibly a cheaper alternative, but they're making the change under the guise of (albeit straight-up horseshit) "customer concerns"?
If it doesn't still taste like Diet Pepsi I guess I'm off colas!
"one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety."

...so proven safe yet taken out of drinks solely because of influence from popular culture? I don't blame Pepsi at all, but it is still incredible to see the effect the uninformed consumer has. 
Now, if they'd just drop caramel coloring. You know, I remember Pepsi Clear. You know what it tasted like? Pepsi.  
The Food Babe wins again!

On a serious note, I think it's funny that aspartame has a lower approval rating than Congress, even though there are so many studies showing that it's safe.
Dammit I have a strong 2 a day Diet Pepsi habit and it's my favorite beverage. I'm gonna be pissed if this tastes worse.
Wonderful. One of the few artificial sweeteners that doesn't taste like ass to me, I hope whatever they use instead doesn't contain actual sugar or isn't as bitter as a morning in Antarctica.
[Coke Zero & Pepsi Max your time has come.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWzcCA-kFy8) 


Yet another reason I'll stick with the smooth, astringent flavor of Diet Coke. Anyway, it seems reasonable to keep drinking aspartame if you are not a phenylketonuric and if you trust either the United States [Food and Drug Administration](http://www.gao.gov/products/HRD-87-46) or the [European Food Safety Authority] (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3496.htm).
I'm just going to bring up a study that, unfortunately, doesn't get much attention when the aspartame conversation comes up: 

>Ralph G. Walton, Robert Hudak, and Ruth J. Green-Waite
>Department of Psychiatry, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine (RGW) and Department of Psychiatry (RGW) and Director of Research (RJG-W) Western Reserve Care System, Youngstown, OH; and Department of Psychiatry, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH (RH)

>This study was designed to ascertain whether individuals with mood disorders are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of aspartame. Although the protocol required the recruitment of 40 patients with unipolar depression and a similar number of individuals without a psychiatric history, the project was halted by the Institutional Review Board after a total of 13 individuals had completed the study because of the severity of reactions within the group of patients with a history of depression.

>In a crossover design, subjects received aspartame 30 mg/kg/day or placebo for 7 days. Despite the small n, there was a significant difference between aspartame and placebo in number and severity of symptoms for patients with a history of depression, whereas for individuals without such a history there was not. We conclude that individuals with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to this artificial sweetener and its use in this population should be discouraged.

Anecdotally, my dad has struggled with anxiety and depression for decades -- I'm fairly sure he's actually suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, but he refuses to seek help or a formal diagnosis. The only thing that has alleviated his symptoms? Stopping his 20+ year habit of multiple Diet Pepsis/Diet Mountain Dews every day. Seriously, I can't even describe the incredible change in his personality when he doesn't drink this stuff. He's a completely different person. But you can tell when he starts up again -- after a few days of consistent use, he's back to being a raging, anxious, terrifying asshole. 

I wish they would do a more extensive study of this. So many people focus on the diet aspects without considering that maybe the steadily increasing rates of depression/anxiety in our population is linked to the stuff we eat and drink. 
Why don't we get rid of all GMO's as well! /s There is not a single scientific study showing evidence of aspartame contributing to cancer risk in humans. In fact, a recent meta-analysis showed there isn't even an increased carcinogenic risk [in rodents](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19338244.2013.828674#). It's amazing how people will just keep running and perpetuating this nonsense. The U.S. consistently runs low on global rankings of scientific knowledge and this is just more evidence that something needs to be done to change that. 

Edit. I'm getting a few responses as relate to metabolic issues. Yes, there does appear to be a relationship there. However, I don't think this is what Joe Q. Public is reacting to. 
They better not fuck with Pepsi Max. I love that shit.
At least there's no chance of any diet soda tasting *worse*.
Well, citing decreased sales linked to people not wanting aspartame. 
I love Diet Pepsi. I don't drink it all the time. I usually opt for something like a flavored seltzer that has no sodium in it but when I feel like a soda, I have a diet pepsi. 

Looks like I have to switch to diet coke. Which is sad for me because I can taste the difference and I don't like it as much. 
I hate aspertame. Shit gives me gas and stomach aches. Same with a lot of my friends. 
I love diet coke, diet pepsi and Pepsi max. It's the only reason I actually drink soda. I like the carbonation and the taste, and I don't get 45 grams of sugar and 45 cavities per serving. I don't get why people are so bitchy about artificial sweeteners. 
Safe or not, I don't drink or eat anything with artificial sweeteners of any kind, as I get migraines whenever I do. I've met three other people in my life with the same results.
Introducing, Crystal Diet Pepsi.
remove aspertame, add sucralose 
Did they maybe just use aspartame under it's new name - "amino sweet"?
Sit back and watch the shitstorn.
I still prefer classic saccharin to these newfangled sweeteners.
Dammit, I just got used to diet Pepsi! I hate the taste of diet Coke. 
I'm guessing they will replace it with Splenda, which in comparison is just as nasty as Aspartame.
Am I the only one that tastes EVERY sugar replacement as bitter? nutrasweet, splenda, all the sugar alcohols, stevia, everything ive tried tastes bitter. If not on first contact with my tongue, very soon afterwards.
Just put Stevia on it for fuck sakes.
"Now with added tapeworms for a significant increase in weight loss. We have created the perfect Diet Soda now"
Diet Pepsi was the best tasting of all colas until they changed the recipe in the mid-late 90s. I hope this somehow makes it taste just like the old one!
Bloody reporters... you can say the words 'wood alcohol'. If you don't, uninformed people will have no way of knowing WHY people distrust it.
I will say, when they tested Diet Coke with Splenda, it TASTED better. Just my completely subjective opinion. This is a good thing, because I think Splenda has a better flavor than aspartame. 
RIP Pepsi.
NOOOO!!! Aspertame is what makes diet pepsi taste like diet pepsi. It's my absolute, favorite drink in the world. This sucks. :(
They should use something natural to sweeten the drinks.  Like sugar, maybe.
Yet it's completely safe. Pepsi now supporting unreasonable fears for no reason. Good job Pepsi. You've made people dumber.
I wish Coke would come out with a Diet Coke sweetened with Stevia.

They have Coca Cola Life, which is reduced-calorie, but it's not zero-calorie.
I've never understood why instead of a "diet" soda that contains artificial sweeteners, why don't beverage companies just make a soda with reduced sugar?  I would actually prefer it if my soda was less sugary, but the fake sugar and additives (and especially aspartame) I'd rather just stop drinking soda completely if my choice is regular soda and diet.
This wlll kill Diet Pepsi, just like the Sucralose version of Diet Mountain killed that beverage.  

I am told that Surcralose "tastes more like sugar."  But I just don't care; I prefer the taste of asparatame.  
lol fucking ridiculous.

zero evidence for aspartame being bad.
"The change only applies to the U.S. market..."

Thank frak!
Granted, it's not a completely valid opinion, given that I haven't tasted the 'new' version, but I LOVE Diet Pepsi! I may miss going to a baseball game, but I've never been happier to not live in the US.

And yes, I know it's just a soft drink.
Obviously I am not a soda drinker. But I really don't understand diet soda. If you're trying to watch what you eat/drink, why not just eliminate soda from your diet? Surely water is a better option. And if you do need the caffeine boost a little bit of coffee should do the trick without all that other crap. 
After this, people will think they were right. Goddammit Pepsi, use science.
The ignorance and stupidity in many of these comments is truly amazing. That is all. 
I hope they replace it with snake oil.  At least that's been proven to be safe and cure baldness, cancer, and erectile disfunction.
Diet coke tried to switch to Splenda and there was damn near rioting in the streets… well, not riots, but people complained and they dropped the Splenda. 
Wait, so what are they going to use in place of it?
Thank God; Diet Pepsi tastes like cat piss. Or at least what I think cat piss would taste like. 
As somebody allergic to ace-K, this changes nothing. Diet Coke will still be my go-to soft drink.
So, what did they replace it with? 
Still waiting for someone to come up with an easy way to produce L-glucose.  They'd be billionaires overnight.
If I had know-how, ambition, money, etc., I would like to tinker with trying to make a good-tasting soda with xylitol. I've suggested this idea online before and people respond by saying how xylitol causes diarrhea, but it's actually much less likely to do so than sorbitol. I've had up to 10 g a day and never had any changes as a result. Of course, when tinkering with a recipe you'd have to keep that side effect in mind, and it might possibly mean a less-sweet soda than people are used to. Xylitol has huge dental benefits, but these might be somewhat offset by the acidity soda normally has, so the other trick would be to come up with something tasty that has more of a neutral ph. I think it could be done. How bad could xylitol, carbonated water, and flavoring taste--even if it's not as acidic or sweet as something like diet pepsi? The bar isn't too high IMO (diet pepsi isn't exactly an amazing taste).
I drank it for the gross aspartame taste :(
Serious question, does anyone know if sucralose, the replacement sweetener, is in any way related to saccharin? That shit is WAY nastier than aspartame. Gives me constipation and headaches. It also tasted horrible too. I'm old enough to to remember when Tab had saccharin in it and tasted awful. Been using Equal in my coffee for 20 yrs or so and never had a problem with it. If the new sweetener is a saccharine derivative, it's time to switch to Coke.
so why is this happening only in the USA and not canada...?
Regular and diet pepsi tastes like dog ass so this can only help it.
now if they could only make diet mountain dew not taste like complete shit.
Ah yes, another one of these threads. I'll go find a better circle jerk to join.
Sorry but aspartame and Splendia both taste nasty.  I like Stevia. 
I think it hilarious how aspartame has been demonized. A substance that sweetens a drink while adding no caloric intake? Must be Satan.
Except here in Canada.. 
TIL that my dream job is to be a staff writer for Beverages Digest.
Coke has a new line of products using Stevia, which is a sugar alternative. I like the switch from it because honestly, one can of soda is more sugar than we are supposed to consume in a day...
I've been drinking Diet Pepsi since it came on the market.

My plan for a fully preserved body at my death is now ruined!
The brand Diet Rite in the US actually has a pretty good diet cola. No sodium, no caffeine, no sugar, uses sucralose and strangely tastes good...so does their Tangerine flavored ones but its harder to find.
Booooooo! That was the best diet soda :(
I'd be excited if i wasn't already switching from diet cola to seltzer water.
Perhaps this will make Diet Pepsi fit for human consumption! Though I somehow doubt it.
Diet Rite cola is made with sucralose, and it tastes...great, actually. When I was low-carbing, this was the recommended soda because sucralose is thought to be a better choice than nutrasweet for...I don't remember what the reasoning is, but it tastes great.
Why wouldn't they have done it sooner if that's the case?  Sucralose was discovered in 1976 apparently and the other shit Acesulfame Potassium was discovered in 1967.  Maybe it's become cheaper recently, I don't know but seems like an odd reason.  Maybe they just realised Pepsi tastes like shit and the change might improve the flavour?
More likely they are doing it for PR.
I don't understand [why they don't go with erythritol,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythritol) it tastes **exactly** like sugar and has the real syrupy mouthfeel of sugar, with no calories and no cavities in your teeth.

I've been using it for about a year and have no side effects whatsoever.
To be honest I believe them. I've heard a lot of gluten-free people bitch about aspartame.
That is exactly why they're doing it.
Almost guaranteed. But there's an initial cost to switch their process. So this was a double win. Because they can take some pr budget and use it for retrofit. 
Sucralose also doesn't have a metallic aftertaste. It's whats used in most energy drinks. 
Doesn't coke have coke life and use stevia already?
it costs 10 times more $300 vs $30 per kilo
Sucralose also has a much longer shelf life. Aspartame is actually a short peptide and breaks down over time (especially at high temperature, which is why you can never cook with it). Sucralose is even more stable than table sugar (it doesn't even brown with heat). The longer shelf life also reduces costs of storage and shipping, since you can stockpile it on a larger scale. Consumers also give more favorable reviews to Sucralose, and it doesn't come with all the baggage of aspartame or other sweeteners (whether justified or not).
Drink up Jake.
They are both dirt cheap at that level, I'd assume aspartame is cheaper since it's been around longer. 

They probably just didn't switch for logistics and legal reasons, I doubt cost is an issue. I'm sure the profit margin is pretty huge either way.

I prefer Sucralose and I think most people do, it's just not as well known really. I buy the powder from amazon because spenda is kind of a rip off and has sugar in it.

A few sprinkles of pure sucralose will make a whole gallon of Koolaid or tea, it's much cheaper than soda and you get way more flavor choices. You can brew all kinds of tea combinations or just use the ice tea packets. 
The markup on soda is so high and the amount of these sweeteners used is so low that it's completely negligible as far as price is concerned (I'd sucralose was even cheaper which it isn't)  
The extra cash will come from increased sales by the anti aspartame crowd. 
It may factor into it, but that's not the reason for a total change.  Diets are declining and this will probably retain a few buyers since consumers are switching to natural alternatives.  All companies are addressing the issue differently, like with Coke Life and the Dr Pepper/7up/Canada Dry/etc. TEN line
It won't. Have you tried Diet Coke with Splenda?
Seriously,  it is going to taste very different. This is going to suck. 
Well yeah, because selling fizzy drinks isn't the same as, say, immunising kids.

Business isn't about what is true or not, or safe or not, it's about whether people are buying it or not.
They'll just change to a different sweetener, likely one that hasn't gone through such extensive testing. This ignorance could be bad for the consumer and the manufacturer. 
But foodbabe said..
Yet the sugar in full strength Pepsi is killing or causing real health problems for millions and no one bats an eyelid.
> ...so proven safe yet taken out of drinks solely because of influence from popular culture? I don't blame Pepsi at all, but it is still incredible to see the effect the uninformed consumer has.

That is the reason some companies do not want GMO labeling.
Some Guy at work saw me drinking a Diet Coke once. Says to me: "you know that stuff is bad for you? I was having horrible headaches," he said. "Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, I switched from Diet to regular Coke and the headaches went away immediately."

Later that day I notice he's on his third can. So I ask him: "how much soda do you drink?"

"Nine or 10 a day," he said.

What can you say to logic like that? 
>"one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety."
 

Damn. Yet every time I have a diet coke someone's telling me about the lack of research into aspartame and how we don't know how dangerous in can be or such.
Not quite. First off, there are studies that say it's safe, AND there's studies that show it's unsafe. 

Each study looks at certain parameters. If it shows to to be safe for those parameters, they report it as safe. If there's a problem, it'll report a problem. 

What's really interesting is the difference in results between studies funded by the Aspartame industry, and independent studies. *The vast majority of studies funded by the Aspartame attested to it's safety, where as the majority of studies independently funded reported a problem*. 
http://dorway.com/aspartame-the-bad-news-repost/peer-reviewed-aspartame-studies/

John Oliver did a great segment on the affect of of corporate funding on the affect of a study's outcome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepXBJjsNxs#t=6m25s

Some of these industry funded studies are pretty ridiculous, going as far as saying that diet sodas are actually better for you than water. 
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277568.php

 
Look at Nuclear Power.

Cheap, clean, abundant, environmentally friendly and could eliminate offshore energy dependency?

Can't have that.
I need INDEPENDENT STUDYS

>"one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety."

...but who paid for those studies and are they peer reviewed?
it's important not to simply trust that journalists have done the research. here's an abstract from the American Journal of Industrial Medicine: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436139

and it's also important not to think that just because it shows little toxicity for humans in SOME studies, that this is the case for other animals in our environment (who end of taking it in by default).  here's an abstract from the journal Food Chemical Toxicology: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21855599

Go to the academic/scientific studies and confirm for yourself what journalists are claiming.

And while this one has nothing to do with aspartame, here's an example of why you do YOUR OWN research and not just swallow what others are saying, even if they are "experts": http://www.cbsnews.com/news/woman-misdiagnosed-with-cerebral-palsy-gets-cure-after-33-years/

the "experts" are important to listen to -- but assuming they are right automatically without doing your own work is just lazy.  experts are a starting point.

Unfortunately uninformed people will take this as further vindication of their uninformed beliefs, perpetuating the cycle.
They call anyone that has problems with it "individual sensitivities" and discount them.  I know several people that get headaches and have visible skin conditions when they drink aspartame sweetened beverages.  I doubt Sucralose is any better and it will just be different people with different sensitivities but this way at least there will be a choice of which substance you want to risk when you choose Coke or Pepsi.
Aspartame gives me migraines, so I'm certainly not going to complain about this. 

It may be generally safe, but it's not so good for me. 

(And that is documented, so not an uninformed consumer issue: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/basics/causes/con-20026358)
Yeah we'll when 90% of those studies are done by the people making the stuff it kinda raises some red flags for me personally. But keep drinking your diet mtn dew and killing bags of doritos like it's your job. Neckbeards aren't supposed to stray far from the hive mind. But you're probably some type of internet medical professional so of course I'm wrong for having a differing opinion.
[deleted]
If youd care to take a long a closer look on aspartame you would understand why. The way it was forced through FDA and people was fired for refusing to approve it after testing showed brain tumors in rats.

Im no expert if its safe or not, but there are legitimate concerns. And for those reasons I also avoid any product with aspartame in it.
And this is one reason that people believe the popular vote should not be the deciding factor of the presidency.  Just because the majority of people want something, doesn't mean its the best thing for them.
Exactly.  I've consumed so much aspartame over the years that I should be totally fucked if there's really anything harmful about it.
It helps that nutrisweet and equal both taste like poison to me while other artificial sweeteners dont.
Same thing with GMOs
 
This is why scientists are against GMO labelling of foods. No matter how much science we have showing the safety of GMO crops people are going to refuse to eat them because "natural".
It does also taste terrible
i don't care if it's safe because it tastes like shit. It's the worst out of a myriad of artificial sweeteners. Why would you ever use it. 
aspertain breaks down when heated it is not stable or safe as a sweetener in sodas. aspertain is safe if used in a timely manner  but soda cans tend to sit around for months at a time befor bring drank and if left in the sun heats up all of witch is not good for the aspertainelong term
My mom can't drink anything with aspartame... Gives her horrid migraines.
Feels>Reals
Being studied does not make something the best choice, it just means it doesn't hurt people. There are lots of things you can add to soda that won't hurt people.

The things you want to add though are things that people want or things that make it taste better. Sucralose will make diet soda taste better, plain and simple. It clearly tastes more like sugar than aspertame ever has. 

I don't understand why your complaining. Pepsi is going to to be one of the first companies to have surcralose soda in every store in the country, it's great they are breaking away from the decades of aspertame and recipes to try to cover up the taste of asptertame. 

It's not like diet soda was welcomed with open arms by the public. It's taken decades to get the masses, especially men, to drink it. It's only recently that diet soda has become so popular really (to some degree because of obesity and diabetes becoming so prevalent) and still lots of people won't drink it.

When you give them sucralose instead they can hardly tell any difference, so it's a rather huge advantage but technically it's less tested yes, it's tested well enough and people like the taste more.

The real question is what took them so long to realize this.
It's kind of the same thing regarding cochineal extract in food because people didn't like the idea of crushed bugs in their strawberry milkshake.
"If it's so safe, why did they need a hundred studies to prove it?"
But it still tastes bad... 
Well then I would recommend that you ingest it every day in quantities. Put it in your coffee, sprinkle it on your cereal and a diet soda several times a day.
We consume a lot of things here in the states that isn't allowed in food in other countries.. brominated vegetable oil for example in mountain dew. A flame retardant, why in soda?
Is aspartame allergy actually so uncommon? I know a couple of people with allergeric reactions to it (one only gets asthma-like symptoms, but the other breaks out in hives), but I never hear it come up in conversations about aspartame.

Also, aspartame has to carry a warning for people with phenylketonuria, because it's toxic to them. I mean, phenylketonuria is rare, but it's still out there and aspartame is in fucking loads of stuff. I'm happy to see it being replaced with a seemingly less poisonous alternative, even if the reason is just because sucralose is cheaper and has a longer shelf life.
I just don't like the taste. 
>... it is still incredible to see the effect the uninformed consumer has. 

(Soft Drink's target market / largest consumer)
Do your own research before citing the reference as true. There is a large volume of research to the contrary regarding the impact of aspartame, and its questionable approval by the FDA. 
It always had a bit of a cinnamon taste to me. It wasn't bad though.
Crystal Pepsi was good but if my memory is correct it did taste slightly different than regular Pepsi.
I must be the only freak that misses Pepsi Blue :(
Most of reddit wasn't alive to witness Pepsi Clear.

I could go for some Diet Crystal Pepsi ... Right Now!
> aspartame has a lower approval rating than Congress

This is possible?
We live in a world where "lower approval rating than congress" is considered a shocking statistic.
What type of congress are we talking about here?
It might be safe, but it tastes like shit.
My guess is they've got something at least as good waiting in the wings - otherwise they wouldn't announce this. It might not taste as good to everybody, though.
The acidity of diet pepsi isn't good for your teeth anyway.

They re swapping to sucralose, which I find tastes a bit better.
I love Diet Coke for the same reasons. They ruined Diet Pepsi years ago when they started adding Ace-K. 
I have mood disorders in my family, and have suffered through my own bouts of depression in the past. Aspartame can sometimes make me as anxious and edgy as caffeine, and can make it difficult to sleep. I avoid the stuff as much as possible. 
Did he drink coffee or any other caffeinated beverages? Because I'd guess caffeine does a number on anxiety.
This is a horrible study. 40 patients recruited, 13 completed. It's a failed study. It's not been replicated. You cannot do studies this way, 13 is likely not powered to detect the difference of an appreciable effect size of aspartame on mood disorders. They halted it by the review board, this means it is a failed study. 

This is pure statistical manipulaton. 

I mean, great... Replicate it and see, but this is likely a novelty of statistics than a real thing. 

I'd also like to point out that 30mg/kg/day is equivalent to about 10 cans of diet cola and would be very difficult to placebo. 

Edit : a new study (just found it)  using  a similar crossover design and finding no I'll effects. This adds to the pile of literally hundreds of articles demonstrating aspartame safety, compared to a handful of small, unreplicated studies that use bad statistics to show a negative result.

It's not so much about a carcinogenic effect but that aspartame causes the body to react as though it is sugar and unduly increase insulin levels which can lead to disfunction of organ operations thereby increasing exposure to disease and other health problems...
The metabolic reasons are the only non taste reasons I abstain. Aspertame leaves a lousy aftertaste, and even HFCS has been giving me an overly sugary taste lately in non-small doses. Its helped me kick soft drinks out almost entirely.
You should get new friends if they give you gas and stomach aches. 
They just taste like ass to some people. My brother has no problem with diet coke but hates coke zero. I'm the opposite. Aspertame in diet sprite however tastes really close to regular sprite for both of us. 

Artificial sweeteners are finicky in that way.

Do you mean the incredibly detailed responses about how diet sodas are great for you as if they are written by PhDs?
Right there with you. It coats my tongue like fur and I get a little vomity. I treat it like an allergy and avoid it completely. 
Splenda tastes like metal to me. Aspartame just tastes nasty.
You can still buy Diet Coke with Splenda.  Its another flavor Coke offers.
Pepsi's job is to sell Pepsi, not inform the people. 
>for no reason

they are a business, they're here to make money
I don't get why they aren't going the "Diet Coke with Splenda" or "Coca Cola Life" route and creating a new variant product without aspartame instead of fucking with one of their core brands. I guess they must have a good reason.
I drink diet soda exclusively because I don't like to waste my allotted calories on liquids. Now I am going to have to waste even more time with asshats telling me aspartamine is bad for me. I'm just going to tell people I am diabetic...
Actually, dumb people made Pepsi support unreasonable fears.
I think coke zero is ten times better than the regular variety. Especially the vanilla flavor.

I'm all for stevia. But people are too stubborn to accept it wide scale. Yes, it tastes a bit different and your coke would not be what you remember from your youth, but it would be remarkably healthier for you for a myriad of reasons. 

I drink lots of zevia sodas from the store mainly for this reason. They are not coke or Dr pepper, but close enough to satisfy my need for a fizzy drink. 

One last note though, though. Stevia sweetened drinks often include another plant based sweetener extract, I can't recall it's name but it's on the label of most of them. This sweetener is the closest to natural sugar taste and sweetness level on the market. I've googled it in the past trying to understand what it was. It does not raise your blood sugar levels or cause insulin spikes either. In fact it is so non absorbed into your blood that it is excreted in your stool in practically the same molecular concentration and format as it went in. This is an amazing substance! But this is also going to find resistance because higher concentrations of this in your bowel cause excess fluid build up, or lose stool. Consuming to many zevias at once can send you to the bathroom within hours. It's somewhat of a natural diuretic. With continued exposure I've found this effect to be less and less pronounced. But for the general public, the first time it happens to them regardless of the crazy health benefits stevia affords will probably go back to what "tastes" best and put their own health aside. 
zevia cola isnt coke, but it is a stevia sweetened cola. its not bad, but their root beer is better.
it exists and its called dry soda. i've had the ginger, the apple, and the cucumber. I think they make more normal flavors too. The apple was not that remarkable, but the cucumber and the ginger sodas are god damn delicious.
[Here](http://www.healthychoices.co.uk/Tsakiris_Pharmaco_Res_Jan_2006_Aspartame.pdf)'s a peer-reviewed journal article. [Here](http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v62/n4/full/1602866a.html)'s another.

A normal can of pepsi has about 40-42 g sugar (i.e. 10 teaspoons). A can of diet pepsi contains about 225 mg aspartame—there's 45 mg in a standard packet with sweetening power equivalent to 2 teaspoons of sugar, so in the end it's still the equivalent sweetness of 10 teaspoons / 40-42 g of sugar in that can.

Xylitol is just as sweet as sucrose, meaning if it were the only sweetener in there you'd need the full 40 g... that much is *probably* going to cause some digestive problems, and it would definitely be a hell of a lot more expensive to produce. Maybe you could do 10 g or so of xylitol and make the rest up with stevia... or do erythritol and stevia... or heck, maybe just stevia.
[Sucralose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose) (i.e. Splenda) is entirely different from [saccharin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin) (i.e. Sweet n Low).
sucralose is made through some kind of process involving chlorine and actual sugar.
Diet Rite was the only soda I could drink while pregnant and it was delicious.  Totally underrated.   
Mmmm I love Diet Rite.  They definitely don't have any shortage of carbonation in it though.  Burps for days. 
>  sucralose is thought to be a better choice than nutrasweet for...I don't remember what the reasoning is,

People scared of aspartame for no good reason.

> but it tastes great.

That's what's most important. Drink what ya like.


There used to be a diet coke with splenda. I liked it more than the regular, but I haven't seen it in years.
>  Sucralose was discovered in 1976 apparently 

I don't think Sucralose was used in diet soda until the 1990's.   Aspartame was introduced in the 1980's.   In the 1970's it was saccharine or nothing.
They have been tinkering with enzymatic production of aspartame, so if anything were to change it would probably be aspartame becoming cheaper to produce.

The chemical synthesis is probably still cheaper. The aspartame and sucralose synthetic pathways are of roughly comparable complexity AFAIK, and the reagents in both are pretty cheap.

I'm sure price factors into these decisions, but I think it's a much less important consideration than things like how it tastes, how it affects shelf life, and obviously marketing concerns.
My guess is it cost too much. Things like aspartame are potent and the cost per can is trivial. But erythritol undoubtedly cost more than sucrose.  
Probably because of that weird mintiness.
I don't like the syrupy mouth feel of regular soda. :( Soo gross, makes me need to brush my teeth my teeth and fast.
No side effects?  Fortunately then, you don't consume it in the quantities that some of their good soda customers would be.  Where sugar alcohols would cause their bowels to rather quickly decide that they would rather be empty.
Fuck erythritol, makes me feel like crap. Of course,  I'm allergic to the corn it's made from.
It's less sweet than sugar which means it requires more material for production.  Think about how much sugar is in a regular soda (33 grams in a 12 oz coke).  They'd have to increase that amount.  The other sugar alcohols are much sweeter than sugar.  Sucralose, for instance, is about 400 times sweeter than sugar.  So, less is required for production.  It's a cost saving measure.    
Pure sucralose tastes like sugar also, it's made from sugar, it's probably the best artificial sweetener out there and it's cheap enough that it can't hurt their bottom line. Aspartame, I'm sure, is cheaper and since they had been using aspertame for years there isn't much reason to change except now people can buy their own sure sweetner on the internet and make drinks without the need for soda companies.

I would be making powder packets like Koolaid does, but with PURE surclose right in them. You could easily dominate the flavor game like that and that would be a good start. I think carbonation is overrated and more ppl will figure that out eventually once they realize how awesome pure sweetner powder is. 

It even makes making Koolaid and other drinks faster and easier since you hardly even have to stir since your not adding cups of spelda or sugar. We even use it to make a much healtheir coleslaw than adding sugar.

What's the relationship there? 

It's not like there's gluten in aspartame... right? 
I definitely believe them as well. Aspartame vitriol has become ubiquitous because everyone has 'heard' that it causes cancer/holes in your brain. I'd like to think the only reason sucralose isn't getting hit with hate opinions is because it sounds more like sugar. 
Hell my doctor even told me he considers it worse than sugar.
You mean Coke Zero? It's delicious.
Next we'll hear Aspartame causes Autism.
Life isn't about what is true and what isn't it's about what people perceive.
Nailed it. I like how the quote below implies that both chemicals may be cancer risks, as if that has been conclusively proven and not refuted by U.S. and European regulatory bodies (for both chemicals.)

> "Diet Pepsi will still contain acesulfame-potassium (ace-K). Consumers should avoid that sweetener as well," warns Michael Jacobson, director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. "It is poorly tested, but the tests done by the manufacturer in the 1970s suggest that ace-K, too, might pose a cancer risk."

Hm... I wonder what xylitol-sweetened Pepsi would taste like. 
Splenda, according to the article.
Or sugar, which is basically cocain.
https://imgflip.com/i/kmh96
I just want them to make my vegetables taste like pizza and have everything I need in it. I will be a vegan then
And it's a very good reason at that.

I work with both GMO and 'anti-GMO' farmers. For the last few years the Organic/Anti-GMO farmers and manufacturers have been saying that if they could get GMO products labelled, they would be able to 'fairly' compete in the market. Even though there are already multiple variations of labels for products that want to be organic or anti-gmo, and it is a phrase that is getting more and more tightly regulated. 

GMOs have never, ever, been proven to have any of the harmful side effects that fear mongerers claim. Demonizing them is purely for profit. 

And frankly, what would happen if they DID put a GMO warning label on products? Very quickly we'd see that just about everything in the store, including some of our produce, contains GMOs. There would be shock, and then acceptance, and then no one would care at all. We'd also even find out some "Organic" products contain GMOs.

It's all a very ~~bad~~ stupid idea. Sadly it gains traction every time there's a vote, so eventually it's going to happen. The non GMO farmers will rejoice, the GMO farmers will cry... and then a few years later everything will be exactly the same except the owners of a few anti-GMO companies will be a little richer.

Edit: Phrasing, I also want to take back saying that it's a bad idea. It's not so much a bad idea as it is just a stupid one.
Aspartame can cause severe headaches in some people. 

Obviously that doesn't mean you should switch to soda with sugar. 

I had severe daily migraines that were so bad I took anti-seizure medication daily, and I still had them 1-2 times a week. It turns out they were being caused by aspartame, bananas, and mushrooms, all of which I was eating a lot of because I was trying to "eat healthy" at the time. 
I am training in a medical field.  In one of my evaluations one of my overseers wrote all good things about me until a lovely little note at the end saying something to the effect (I forget the verbatim phrasing) of "...needs to correct her dietary habits as they are unacceptable for a health professional."  Her qualm with my dietary habits?  I drink diet soda.

When I first got the review I was mortified by what i perceived as a bad mark.  Then I got angry at how ridiculous it was.  Now I just laugh about it :P
Set one up. Just need a lot of money.
While we're throwing abstracts around, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8932606) is one you might like. Briefly, rBGH was approved by the FDA based on a study on 7 rats conducted by a lab with a history of ethical lapses.
Actually it was pretty rare for the permeate to be used in plain milk like that. It's just that now they can stick that label on milk that never had it,  because it sounds good. 
How is it?
What's a permeate?
As others have pointed out, the same thing happened to MSG. One false study was published in the 80's and, since then, every single Asian restaurant I go to has a "NO MSG!" sign on their front door despite the numerous amounts of recent studies that have shown MSG to be perfectly safe. My wife is from Vietnam and uses a little MSG in some of her dishes. No one in my family has ever had an issue with it.
My mother and I both get sore mouths, throats, and stomach aches from aspartame
Does the same thing to me every bloody time, I hate the stuff. The crazyness is so bad some of the morons on here even try to argue with you that it doesn't give you headaches despite the entire internet being full of people who get them and know for a simple fact it does. 

These people have got to be paid by someone, nobody can really be that stupid and do they think they are actually going to win that argument against someone who actually gets the headaches do they think we will just suddenly agree with them and pretend we had a great time instead or something.

To top it off it just tastes rotten which is just as good a reason to avoid it.
Are there any studies that you can link to which show this effect in some people? I'm not trying to put down your anecdotal claims; if aspartame affects some people in this way then it is important to know what causes it.

Edit: found this link further down, I wonder if people who get migraines from the stuff have anything else in common?

studies tend to be funded by the people that make the thing because they have an interest in that things success, including its safety. There are independent studies, but they're more rare since there are fewer groups that do independent research on product safety then there are companies that make products. That's why peer review is so important to this process. They studies may often be done by the people that make the stuff, but those studies are reviewed and critiqued by other scientists that don't make the stuff. 
Probably because it's gin and Fresca. 
Henry Weinhard's Orange Cream soda is made with BVO, and it's fucking glorious.
Yea, when I first started reading about Brominated Vegetable Oil they made it sound like some terrible thing that never leaves your body.  But it does, it just has a long half-life.  Like two weeks.  So it can build up quicker than you dump it, but it's not that big of a deal.

Still, rather not have it.  All it does is stop citris flavors from settling, there are other additives that accomplish the same thing.
Wait, that's a completely separate issue.

You're basically advocating for some votes to matter less in an election and for elections to concentrate on battleground states. The entire point of an election is to promote who the people want. Voting is literally majority rule, not a scientific study of sweetener.
No I don't think you understand the Electoral College system. Maybe you're thinking Direct Democracy, sorta like California does it sometimes?

The Electoral College debate is about using that system which purposely skews the worth of votes by binning, for better or worse, over a system which equally weighs every vote.

I think a large majority of reddit was alive to see Pepsi Clear.
Right around the time it got pulled from the market young me accidentally left a six pack in the truck in winter and it froze and all the cans ruptured. I was never able to get it again, and I'm still arse-furious over the whole thing.
Yeah there are many numbers to choose from.
Sweeteners are really weird like that. I tried this one that everybody raves about (I can't remember which) to use in my coffee, and it gave it a really really odd taste. Not good or bad, but just weirdly unpleasant. Aspartame by itself never tastes good, but typically in diet soda it tastes fine for me. 

Walmart changed their sweetener in their generic "coke zero" flavor like a year ago, and it started tasting like soap. This is the true struggle of life.
I can tell the difference between all the sweeteners. Regular sugar tastes the best to me by far. The others usually have a lingering sweetness in the back of my mouth.
[i think i found your problem](http://io9.com/5671331/25-of-the-population-are-supertasters----are-you-one-of-them)

do you also hate grapefruit? to me it's like having my tongue struck by lightning.
I have the soap taste gene or whatever it is, but don't mind aspartame one bit. It's rather strange how much people's taste differs on something that's supposed to just be a sugar replacement. 
Holy crap! TIL my taste buds are weird because it also tastes like chalk to me too.
Yeah, I prefer it too. 
Huh, cilantro tastes like shit to me, but I guess I lucked out on Aspartame 
Interesting. I've never heard the soap in cilantro thing.   
My wife is glad to hear this. She has a chronic allergy to aspartame -- a small taste is enough to make her tongue numb, a full serving would probably put her in the hospital.
Diet coke has ace k also...
He's perfectly fine on coffee, and regular sodas too. Even sodas with stuff like Splenda and other fake sweeteners don't affect him the same way -- we've done a LOT of experimenting. While I can definitely agree that caffeine can make anxiety worse, it's hard to communicate the exact monster his anxiety transforms into. It's not that it just gets worse. He's not just anxious anymore -- he becomes obsessive and neurotic to the point where he starts displaying some OCD characteristics.

Growing up with him was not fun. But he's much better now. 
>This adds to the pile of literally hundreds of articles demonstrating aspartame safety, compared to a handful of small, unreplicated studies that use bad statistics to show a negative result.

Not quite. First off, there are studies that say it's safe, AND there's studies that show it's unsafe.

Each study looks at certain parameters. If it shows to to be safe for those parameters, they report it as safe. If there's a problem, it'll report a problem.

What's really interesting is the difference in results between studies funded by the Aspartame industry, and independent studies. The vast majority of studies funded by the Aspartame attested to it's safety, where as the majority of studies independently funded reported a problem. http://dorway.com/aspartame-the-bad-news-repost/peer-reviewed-aspartame-studies/

John Oliver did a great segment on the affect of of corporate funding on the affect of a study's outcome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepXBJjsNxs#t=6m25s
 
Some of these industry funded studies are pretty ridiculous, going as far as saying that diet sodas are actually better for you than water. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277568.php
That's not even true. In some people, sure. But those are reactions from drink tons and tons of normal full sugar drinks.


Yes.  The only artificial sweetener that doesn't raise blood sugar is stevia.  Too bad it tastes like mung.
So, why not just cut out all added sweeteners from your diet?

I stopped eating that shit a couple years ago and never looked back.

I feel great, my body fat is way down and I just have tons of energy.

Soda in general is pure shit for you, if people are worried about the artificial sweeteners they need to re-evaluate how they live their lives.
But I'm type 1 diabetic anyways so it doesn't really do shit to me. I cant make insulin anyway, so we are the exception to this rule. Feels good man.

Just discovered that Vanilla Coke Zero is a thing. It's good, but nowhere near the original Vanilla Coke.
Vanilla Coke Zero. Filled with bubbly awesomeness.
I do like the taste of Coke Zero a lot better than Diet Coke. I think Diet Coke tastes like butt, needs Stevia.
How would it be healthier?
you could be thinking of inulin, which is a soluble fiber, and I think it may have a sweet taste. possibly erythritol, a sugar alcohol. 
Cant convince someone whos already made up their mind.

pretty sure dogs are not in pepsi's demographic.
Yeah 40 g would be too much, I imagine. I've only had up to 10 g, though with no issues. Never tried stevia. I've heard people say it has an off taste. Never had erythritol, but just looked it up and it's not supposed to have the laxative effects of xylitol and sorbitol. Could be a winner.
something like 50g would cause digestive discomfort, so a blend of sweeteners would definitely be necessary. something like 5ish g of xylitol and maybe a blend of stevia and luo han guo or something.

Alternatively, and idk if this would work, they could make soda more acidic, and put that miracle fruit shit in it, that makes acids taste sweet
You know, it used to be REALLY CHEAP at my local Publix, but suddenly shot up in price. Not sure why.
It really is. The problems it faces are 1. Super boring name and packaging. 2. The "Diet" label turns off male consumers. That's why there is diet coke and coke zero. 
Does this mean Diet Rite would work better with Mentos than with Coke?  
Diet Rite is my go-to soda if I'm buying 2-liters. It just doesn't go flat easily, and tastes better than the name brand sodas.

Many/most of the clear sodas are the same way.


> People scared of aspartame for no good reason.

TBH I'm scared of aspartame because it literally gives me nightmares.
There *is* a section of the population who have severe reactions to aspartame to be fair. 
Let the insurance companies sort it out.
I can usually find it in 12 packs at safeway. But there are alternatives like shasta cola and diet rite.
Just to be clear, Splenda is a brand name for an artificial sweetener that uses sucralose as its basic ingredient. Diet Rite, Arizona, Tropicana, and other brands use Splenda/sucralose as an artificial sweetener.
Yeah erythritol is in some energy drinks, which have a higher profit margin.
I'm sure their profit margins are so high that the material costs of the soda are quite low. Things like distribution would be a major cost since your shipping around water essentially for no great reason. The cost of the soda mix itself is trivial regardless of what sweetener you add when you compare it to what they sell it for.
Have you ever tried Throwback soda? The same taste, except without the syrupy feel that remains in your mouth after you drink. Apparently everywhere other than America uses cane sugar for their soda instead of high fructose corn syrup and its buddies?
Erythritol has a much weaker laxative effect than other sugar alcohols.

Edit: Thanks for the downvotes. [Here](http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v61/n3/full/1602532a.html) is a study concluding that:

>When consumed in water, 35 and 50 g xylitol was associated with significant intestinal symptom scores and watery faeces, compared to the sucrose control, whereas at all levels studied erythritol scored significantly less symptoms. Consumption of 20 and 35 g erythritol by healthy volunteers, in a liquid, is tolerated well, without any symptoms. At the highest level of erythritol intake (50 g), only a significant increase in borborygmi and nausea was observed, whereas xylitol intake at this level induced a significant increase in watery faeces.
I've used sucralose, it lacks the mouthfeel of real sugar.
The people who advocate gluten-freeness tend to be the same people who advocate aspartame-freeness and GM-freeness.
No. How do people not know that Coke Zero and Diet Coke are two completely different products that taste nothing alike?

I mean what I said. [Diet Coke with Splenda](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/image-library/diet-coke-sweetened-with-splenda). People dislike it enough that it has been discontinued.
[Different stuff.](http://assets.coca-colacompany.com/a3/be/3f0190d248cab9af501c06dd35d8/lg_diet_coke_splenda.jpg) It's pretty good, too. Coke Zero has a mix of Aspartame and Ace-K (in the US, at least).
There was Diet Coke with Splenda too. I think it's gone now.

Coke Zero takes better than Diet Coke (or at least more like what you think of as Coke) because Coke Zero was designed to taste like Coke Classic and Diet Coke was designed to taste like New Coke.
I just heard aspartame causes autism. Something to do with mercury.
Everybody knows that vaccines cause aspartame

The irony is that this might work better than the facts to get people to immunize their kids.

Okay, im not against GMOs or anything but to pass them off as being completely risk free compared to non-GMO is misleading.  It is true that there are no negative effects for humans consuming GMO products, but there are environmental concerns regarding their use like insect resistance to Bt.

In China MSG is on the table, right next to the salt shaker. (Actually I can't say I've never seen a shaker there...it's usually a small bowl.)
When I roast whole chicken I use the cheapest chicken spice in the store which is like 80% MSG. I love it.

My anecdotal claim is that I have absolutely no noticeable negative reaction to aspartame and ace-k. Pretty much the only sodas I drink re diet coke and coke zero. Although, truth be told, I don't consume much of them.

As John Yudkin wrote in Pure White Deadly, the studies which showed artificial sweeteners as being dangerous, causing cancer and selling your first born into child slavery etc used levels of consumption that would make sugar at least as dangerous. He also said that the best thing anyone can do is get used to not having (as much) sweet stuff.

I find whole the argument a bit weird. It's a but like arguing that you take cocaine instead of crack (although that is an exaggeration). If you really care about health, drink water instead.
But it shows that what the masses want/believe isn't always the best for them, or what is logical/proven.  People are easily misled by false facts, stories, personal experiences and do no research just blindly follow.

Stevia tastes like ass in coffee.
Not good or bad, just weirdly unpleasant 
Or you could.. You know... Not drink soda at all
I have this problem, but I guess thankfully I've been able to cope with diet soda since aside from water its one of the few choices I have that doesn't require more meds. My psychology professor was talking about supertasters and gave everyone in the class a very cheap brand of artificial sweetener and told them to dump it in their mouth. Mine sent me retching towards the trashcan because of how bitter it was.


Always nice to learn about how even similar things in humans can vary so widely. 
That explains one thing but what explains the foods that other countries like that taste like rotten poison to people from other countries?

Like the phynl whatsit they list on all aspartame containing products? 
Not in the US, at least not where I live. In most of the rest of the world, though, yes. 
 When your source is "the truth about aspartame".com you're not searching the way I search. I search with pubmed and Google scholar, and also I followed the only 3 papers to ever cite op's very flawed study. 

There have been independent metaanalysis of aspartame in peer reviewed journals and they even have bias funnel plots. There is likely no significant negative biological effect of aspartame in humans. 
Or no. From what I've seen studies either show artificial sweetners have no effect on insulin or, for some like saccharine, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

I'd suggest the people that order *"4 12" pizzas and 3 portions of garlic bread, a box of donuts...oh and 1.5L bottle of diet soda"* are the ones that have decided it doesn't help weight control or affects their blood sugar.

Always makes me laugh too that, if your insulin levels don't rise that's called "diabetes" and you go into a coma and die - yet somehow the diet industry has convinced fat people that insulin is bad for them.
This is only based on one study with 31 subjects. Not exactly robust evidence.
We don't have it here anymore. Was the only no calorie drink my husband could tolerate. 
Blech. 

There's a burger joint in my hometown that still does true fountain coke (where you can adjust the ratios). Instead of doing a 1:1 mix of coke syrup/whatever they do a 2:1. Then add in old-school vanilla syrup (vanilla sugar water, basically).  

It's diabetes in a glass, but oh-so-good.
[deleted]
That's my favorite canned soda by a long shot.

I love those freestyle machines 'cause you can get vanilla coke zero from a fountain. I also like to mix 1/2 diet barq's with vanilla and 1/2 coke zero with vanilla. Mmmmhmmm.
Coke Zero is supposed to taste just like Coke, but minus the sugar.  Diet Coke isn't supposed to taste exactly like Coke; it actually has a unique flavor profile.
> It does not raise your blood sugar levels or cause insulin spikes either.

Aspartame triggers an insulin response as if you consumed actual sugar. Stevia does not.
sadist.

nothing wrong with aspartame.
no sugar? no caffeine? sadist.
Another issue is that erythritol has only ~70% the sweetness of sugar, so you'd either need more of it, or another sweetener in combination. Stevia's a "high-intensity" sweetener on the other hand—much like aspartame/sucralose—and yeah, it does have a slightly bitter off taste. You could probably do a mix of the two, basically like Coca-Cola Life (sweetened partially with sugar, partially with Truvia, a CC-owned erythritol/stevia mixture) but nixing all the sugar and going straight up erythritol/stevia.
Because people know about it now and are buying it more. That's capitalism 
That's a good question. 
Mythbusters tested a bunch of different soda, I don't remember if that was one of them.
Yeah I love it.  The cherry diet Rite is my go to. 
Can you buy a 2L and drop a bunch of mentos in it?   Film it and post it.    For science!

Yeah in America we use High Fructose Corn Syrup. Corn growers are heavily subsidized by the government, thus making all of its products cheap and leading to the ubiquity of corn products and by products in our processed foods. 

I've tried throwback soda and it's nice. It definitely tastes the same but is far more fresh feeling. However, I am not a fan of drinking sugar. It's not that I believe aspartame is the healthier option, but I prefer to not drink my calories.
Do they not know that sucralose is as synthetic as aspartame?
And fact-freeness.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_breeding

Somewhat controversially,[19] several organic food and seed companies promote and sell certified organic products that were developed using both chemical and nuclear mutagenesis. Several certified organic brands, whose companies support strict labeling or outright bans on GMO-crops, market their use of branded wheat and other varietal strains which were derived from mutagenic processes without any reference to this genetic manipulation. These organic products range from mutagenic barley and wheat ingredient used in organic beers[20] to mutagenic varieties of grapefruits sold directly to consumers as organic.[21]
All the farmed food you eat is GMO.  There is almost no chance that any of the food you buy in the store is genetically the same as the wild source plants that they came from.

The only question is HOW they have been genetically modified.  Either through farmer selection or through gene manipulation.  Which one of those is safer/better for the environment?  There is no reason to believe that one is better or worse than the other.
> I don't see why informing people where their food is coming from is a bad thing.

I absolutely whole-heartedly agree. I'd also like to see all food products say where the origin of their ingredients comes from so I can boycot certain states, but that's just me.

There *are* some environmental concerns, but so far they are marginal at best. GMO crops have actually lead to decreased use of pesticides compared to projected growth 50 years ago. *Edit: In fact, our Agronomist just reminded me that we're also getting more efficient with our use of fertilizer as a result of better crop management, mostly thanks to GMO crops.*

As far as Bt specifically - evolution would've caused resistance eventually. We're speeding it up. Which is why farmers are now encouraged to either alternate their GMO-Bt containing plants, or randomly blend non-GMO with their GMOs. 

Monsanto even now recommends alternating GMO and non-GMO (or blending) to prevent or slow down those mutations.

GMOs are also *very* tightly controlled. The guys who made the Arctic Apple talked about the regulations they came up against while developing it. It's not something nations take lightly.

It's also kind of a very silly point.

Yes GMO's *can* be bad. So can blueprints, vehicles, programming languages, etc if used by the wrong people. GMO is completely safe, probably even safer than selective breeding.

It's the genes and what we do with it that people should care about. People should worry if anyone ever develops a gene that makes plants more efficient at photosynthesis, or gives them better roots or something. Broad fights against GMOs though is plain ignorance.

> I don't see why informing people where their food is coming from is a bad thing.

So start labeling the immediate threats instead of bullshit like GMOs. List every pesticide used, and then you'll be amazed at how fast people stop eating produce. 

Labeling should only be done if it's to inform consumers about any safety issues. You can have a label for just about anything in the world. There would not be room for the company's logo. The product would all be labels.

Stevia tastes like wrong always to me. Every time I have some, I realize it _has_ to taste different for others otherwise there's no way it'd be a thing.
I think that's exactly what it was, the powder kind of looked like laundry soap.
Stevia has a distinct aftertaste. I think the green pepsi can which mixes sugar with stevia has a good taste compromise!
A life lived in fear of everything that's not perfect for you is a shallow and empty life indeed.
What reaction was your professor looking for for?
Phenylalanine, yes. Any time we're picking up something that's artificially sweetened, we have to scan the nutrition data and ingredients list for that little warning about the stuff.

She used that sensitivity once, when Dr Pepper was having a taste-test. "Bet you can't tell the difference!" On her third win (with a t-shirt each time), they finally asked her why, then banned her from the rest of the promotion.
Sure, it doesn't beat the real thing. But for a diet soda? That's where it's at for me.
I mix it with Rum on drinking nights. 
coke zero is pretty close in taste to regular coke, seems to me.

Diet coke is the same formula as coke 2, which flopped, but with the sugar swapped out for artificial. coke 2 was formulated to be closer in taste to pepsi.
I also drink coffee by the gallon. ( in each hand ).   Seltzer is just my go to drink for when I want my nose tickled by the bubbles. 
They still only stock two 12-packs on the shelf. That's what's odd to me. 
Why does your frowny face have testes?
but but but sucralose sounds like glucose which is sugar so that means sucralose is basically natural sugar, and aspartame sounds like a chemical so it is man made and evil and probably has the same effect on water that microwaves and saying "Hitler" to it does!  (sad thing is I'm not making this shit up, Mike Adams and the Food Babe spout crap like this all day long)   
Yeah, ricin is waaay more natural and organic.  Let's use ricin instead.
They don't know a whole lot.
aspartame is the combination of naturally occurring amino acids. Sucralose is made from by modifying sucrose. If anything, aspartame is more natural.

Gatorade causes autism when Mercury is in the sky. Breaking news!

That was probably Splenda (not Stevia). It comes very light and powdery.

See, you didn't even :see: my dick, it's short and triangular. Of course having a tiny little triangular dick makes me unhappy all the time. :( (3 Oh great, now I'm flaccid.
Tell them sucralose is really 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-β-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranoside, and then watch them clamor for a ban.
Also sounds a lot like sucrose, which *IS* (common) sugar.
I had one of those scare monger face book post pop up on my feed a while back that toted the dangers on microwaves. One of the points was that it changes the DNA of water. 

All I could think was that if your water has DNA, microwaves are the least of your issues. 
Actually, there just are no studies proving sucralose is unsafe while there are several for aspartame. Sucralose is also not a neurotransmitter.
Lead is natural.

It's also fairly sweet.
>aspartame is the combination of naturally occurring amino acids.

It's methylated though. So it's modified natural stuff, just like sucralose.

Though a single methylation is a smaller modification and generally a less "scary-sounding" one than three chlorinations.
Well this person I know had a kid who had autism and they had Gatorade once, so it's basically confirmed.

I saw that Coca Cola now has a stevia-sweetened variety. Coca Cola Life or something. 
ugh, Stevia tastes like wood bark to me.  Nope.
If well managed, nothing. 

But we're already concerned about herbicide resistance jumping across to weeds, imagine if we had a super-crop that was able to utilize most of the sunlight that hits it (instead of ~3% as plants currently do), and *that* gene jumped to a weed.

But I guess that's probably just as much fear mongering as any other. Maybe the only fear should be if Genetically Modifying plants becomes something easy enough that some dude in his garage could do it.
And look how great that's been going for us. And don't tell me "things can always be worse". Of course it can, but it's pretty messed up right now too.
'Super' doesn't really seem like the right adjective. 
I've started using honey to sweeten my coffee. I really like it. 
Try the liquid sucralose. It tastes different than the powdered stuff to me.
The only person who thinks its an obsession is you. A few drinks isn't an obsession. A daily drink isn't even an obsession.
Yes to all of that.


Yeah, thanks, missed that somehow.
It is sucrose with ~~two~~ three chlorine atoms attached. That was the initial scare tactic that they used to keep people away from it.  The most recent concern was that it is persistant in the urine. I drink a lot of sucralose, but I haven't had the courage to drink my own piss and find out if it's sweet.

It's a government conspiracy!
Breaking news! Scientists say using a shower loofah can cause autism!

So I shouldn't read Petrarchan sonnets while pregnant? Or is it okay so long as I don't listen to them or read them out loud?
Hmm, could be the company that makes it because I've had it straight from the plant and it tastes sweeter than sugar and had no bitterness. I've tried the Zevia sodas, but I think any negative flavors in those are just because they don't have a good recipe figured out. I see it the same as to why I haven't found a sodastream flavor I like. It's like some uncanny valley of flavor.
You should try the extracts. They seem expensive at around $10 per 2oz, but 4 drops is a serving. Most granular sweeteners are actually a ripoff because they are filled with sugar by a different name (usually dextrose or maltodextrin). Also check out Lo Han extract. The 2 mixed together taste like brown sugar. 
I've seen that, but it is expensive and I feel like it is set up to fail like Coke Blak.
i wish it was sweetened purely by stevia, there's still a bunch of sugar in it.
DO NOT BE FOOLED: coca cola "Life" is *not* a cola soda. It's "its own thing". EWW. 0/10, 1/10 with rice.
> Maybe the only fear should be if Genetically Modifying plants becomes something easy enough that some dude in his garage could do it.

When we start finding herbicide-resistant dandelions containing high levels of opiates, we'll know it's happened.
Dont tell them what is in salt then.

That sodium chloride will get you.
>It is sucrose with two chlorine atoms attached

Three chlorine atoms.
I'm not sure. There was a research where pregnant women thinking about autism caused autism. 

*I feel horrible for joking about autism...*
Coke Blak was so fucking weird.
I would venture to say that it was the weirdest flavor variant of a popular soda brand in the US. Not only did Coke Blak taste bad, but it also smelled bad.
So the tax is doing exactly what it is designed to do - have them offer smaller portions of soda.
I used to drink a lot of soda when I was younger until I realized all I wanted was the bubbles and effervescence. I cannot recommend
**CLUB SODA** and **MINERAL WATER** enough. The price has really come down in recent years too.
My issue is, that wasn't Soda popular cuz of government subsidies on corn, thus getting corn syrup cheap? Why not stop subsidies on corn or just subsidies corn not used for corn syrup? 

People paying more will just say 'mah freedoms' while they watch their actual freedoms around them crumble (like the latest attack on the 5th amendment and the government wiping their ass with the 4th).
I do not understand how someone could say they are for liberty and support this shit at the same time.
It is clear that these products contribute to obesity and diabetes and other health problems.   I think it is ok to tax them just like tobacco and alcohol.
Taxes like this should be thrown out across the country.  Bunch of fascists.
Why are they taxing diet drinks if it is about obesity.
Fucking worthless taxes. People are stupid as shit.

I must have missed that part in the Constitution.
Lucky you, I tried club soda and found the taste horrible.  Might have to give mineral water a try.
Soda stream is pretty neat. You can carbonate any drink! Even milk!
Club soda is fucking disgusting though.
75c for a 2L of club soda OR seltzer (the former has potassium, the latter has nothing but water and trace free CO2).
Gerolsteiner is the shit.
Because sodas like Pepsi and Coca-Cola couldn't exist and weren't extremely popular prior to the discovery of high fructose corn syrup.
People are still free to buy soda
Because it's a tax not some striping of basic rights 
A tax on unhealthy foods?
You still have the freedom to buy it


Liberty is inherently selfish.  Unchecked liberty would be disastrous for a huge population.  It isn't difficult to *support* the concept of liberty while *recognizing* the benefits of policies that are intended to improve the overall health of society.

An anology would be thinking your father should be able to do whatever he wants, except heroin and beating your mother. It's not anti-liberty to be pro-societal-health.  

It's obviously a slippery slope, but I think you can at least understand how someone might find themselves on the precipice.
Juice has just as much sugar. Especially the most common types of pasteurized juice that's full of artificial flavors and corn syrup.

You know what contributes to obesity? Low self control. But glad to know my skinny ass gets to pay extra because they can't tell themselves "no".
Then why are diet drinks being taxed in this too? Chicago did this too and everyone knows it has nothing to do with health and everything to do with money. 
No, no it is not appropriate.
These arguments are completely asinine and have no basis in reality. 

Is personal responsibility completely dead to you?  Should everyone suffer because some fat fucks, who know having this stuff in excess is bad for them, but have no self-control.  Philly is going to get far less revenue from this shit than they want. All these projections of the millions the city will rake in for "duh skoools" isn't going to happen. 

Those projected revenues are made under the assumption that people/groups affected, do not change their behavior or respond any differently. Well guess what? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING! Companies are pulling the products from sale. Revenue lost. people are buying outside of Philly. Revenue Lost. People are buying less, or not at all. Revenue lost.  These schemes are just the brainchild of a politician who needs to justify his existence, and further the stranglehold government over us.
It always gets me that Reddit, or opponents of "sin" taxes in general, are typically pro-weed and argue how it could raise money through taxes. Soda, cigarette, alcohol, and weed taxes are all in the same category, intended to allow people to choose what they consume but also pay for the damage it imparts on society (higher healthcare, education, rehab services, etc). 
What about alcohol and tobacco and weed taxes?

>While people often choose “diet” or “light” products to lose weight, research studies suggest that artificial sweeteners may contribute to weight gain. 
Can you point to one study that shows "diet" drinks help someone lose weight, or fight obesity? I can point you to quite a few that say the opposite. Diet drinks are just as bad for you, if not worse in some instances. 
As President Donald Trump once tweeted - have you ever seen a skinny person drinking a Diet Coke? 
> Coka Cola's 'Fuck you, Doctor Pepper drinkers!' tax

What is that?
I know right! Republicans are trying to pass a law requiring you to undergo genetic screening if your employer request it!
I'm not sure why you think this has anything to do with managing your life.

This is a pure cash grab. Soda is addictive and people won't consume much less if the price goes up a little, so the government sees some easy money to be made as long as they charge less than the cost to travel out of town.
I know right Republicans are trying to take away a woman's right to have a safe abortion.

I can't wait till we have a tax on *screen time.*
You said it!
Something tells me you probably require some adult supervision 
The health of a society is responsibility of a government 
This is what blows my mind - I travel the world alot and in other countries - a small is like six oz or something.  Here, it is 24 oz... are you fucking kidding me?!
Fuck you. I only eat out for 2 occasions: 1) in at work and this is likely the only thing I'll have today, so i want it to be *very* filling, or 2) i feel like indulging myself a bit by being lazy and going for a fattening meal. I'm actually quite thin. So, if the fat tubs of shit need to be policed so they don't eat themselves to death like fucking impulse controlled morons, then i will despise them for the rules that are imposed on me. 
The smallest size the US has at most fast food places is a large elsewhere. Not to mention making the cost for a small and large the same making the consumer feel cheated if they go for a small over a large. Don't act like physiological marketing doesn't play a role in this
You show me a store I can buy a 5 oz can of soda.
Um... what does the constitution have to do with this - that applies to the federal government... which the 10th amendment coveys all powers to the states not set forth in the constitution.  Please God don't tell me you are an american.
Maybe try adding a little fruit juice for flavor. A healthier than soda option as well.
Try using the crystal light bottles or Kool aid drink flavoring it makes it healthier then soda yet taste like soda
Except a soda stream isn't designed to carbonate anything but water.
Did the 70s just like not happen in your world?
Did I give you some kind of impression that I didn't know that, or are you just trolling?
Womem are still free to get abortions, but we are just going to put a sin tax on it. Is this an issue for liberty? 


I don't think me saying no to taxes on food is the same as me asking for "unchecked liberty."

I also disagree with your analogy because I do believe that my "father" should be able to do wants to himself. If he wants to try heroin and he is older than 21, feel free. I do not want Uncle Sam telling anyone what to do with their own lives. I understand that some people do not feel that way, and that's fine with me. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind on it. 

The beating your mother thing is completely different. You are saying liberty is a man beating his wife if he wants to. I say that domestic abuse is taking away someone else's liberty and it should be punished severely. 
Any "juice" that contains added sweeteners like corn syrup is subject to the tax
I live in Philly. Juices that contain no added sugar are not included in the tax. And yeah, sure, unsweetened apple/grape juice still has a lot of natural sugar in it. But it also has actual good stuff, mainly vitamin C. So at worst, the tax is encouraging people to switch from soda to unsweetened juice, AKA switch from sugary drinks with negative nutritional value to sugary drinks with *some* nutritional value. I'd call that a positive.
While it probably has gone down somewhat since in 2000 in the US the average soda consumption was 600 12 oz cans per person per year.   That is about 2 cans per day.  I would be fine taxing juice too, I just don't think it is as big of a public health problem.
That or make gym memberships and exercise gear tax deductible

> what does the constitution have to do with this - that applies to the federal government

I'll bet you think state legislators can violate the Establishment Clause, too.
not with that attitude.
Why are you talking about liberty?
I'll take a sin tax over all the sit the GOP is trying to do to make it impossible
Taxes on soda are more analogous to a "sin tax" similar to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs than they are "taxes on food."  In the context of "taxes on food" my analogy is clearly inappropriate.  However, soda is not a food.  Soda, and other non-nutritive negative-impact substances, are an overall drain on society.  Your position is premised on the idea that regulating behavior of an individual cannot be coherent with the concept of liberty.  My argument is that self-destructive behaviors are similar to assault in that the effects are almost never limited to the individual committing the act.  Drug use, like assault, affects a community.  

Do you think obesity, type-2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, etc. have no impact on the liberties of others?  Families of the affected are the most directly impacted, followed by their community and, ultimately, the remainder of society.  Sugar, in the concentrated form found in soft drinks, is not much different than a drug. 

In a modern society it would be difficult to present a case wherein the drug use of an individual (incl., sugar abuse) *does not* impact the life of another individual.  I would actually argue that, given the status of sweeteners in our society, it would be substantially **more important** to regulate their use to minimize their oppressive impact (i.e., loss of liberty) on society.
>I don't think me saying no to taxes on food 


Soda is food?
The overwhelming majority of these "juices" contain less than 10% actual juice (the majority of THOSE are 5% or under) and do not have any significant nutritional value at all.
Holy fucking shit. I have at most two cans per *month*, and that's usually because I'm making mixed drinks on a weekend. You only need one can to make two or three rum and cokes. I can't *imagine* drinking two cans a *day*... and I can charitably be described as "morbidly obese."
Ding ding ding.

Yeah. Seems it's not ok to call low self control what it is anymore. 
Given that it has no calories it is incapable of putting weight onto a person. And to be clear, many 100% all natural juices are loaded with sugar and can exceed the calorie density of many sodas. Unsweetened apple juice for instance has more calories than Coke. Juice is really only healthy in moderation, same with any sugar intensive beverage.  
Then why isn't juice taxed, as well? Why isn't Starbucks, who has drinks with more calories than a typical meal, taxed as well?
It's still a sin tax though. I'm not arguing against it, just saying it's strange how some sin taxes are ok when arguing for weed legalization, yet the same people are mad about it on soda. 
how?

I dont want to pay for somebody's lung cancer. Make them pay for more for something that will cause financial hurt to society down the road.


Newsflash, that's not why you're skinny
Your post history is toxic. Take a break kiddo. 
Ummm, no. Dr. Pepper did not get bought out by Coca Cola. They are still part of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.  

Edit: http://www.snopes.com/dr-pepper-discontinued/
Definitely not true, Dr Pepper Snapple is a separate company
Ah, thanks. I hadn't heard of that.
You act like I support any particular political party...
in all fairness, one party, the GOP, appears to be a bit more wacky than the other right now.
Every time i see "wack job" i think "That's them two kids that have been whacking in my camper."
Is it like comparing a soda tax to the government making life decisions for you?
Probably the people who lost their jobs at Pepsi
Supposedly people have just been going out of town to get their soda, which is why sales figures may have dropped.

Nearly every study I've read indicates that soda is price inelastic, meaning that if the price goes up, demand does not go down as much.
1. I never said anything about myself. I don't even drink soda, so I have no clue why you're getting so worked up about my decisions.
2. I just said that the government did this to raise tax revenue. It has nothing to do with "government saving me from poor decisions." They could care less, so I have no idea why you're clinging to that idea, except you're one of those weird libertarians who thinks it's a good idea to walk into a police station fully armed.
3. Go educate yourself and learn more about the way the world works.
Are you really trying to claim that caffeine isn't addictive? I know not all soda has it but the main sellers do and they're what people think of when you say *soda*. The sugar is what matters but don't try and tell me that shit isn't addictive.
Yes, soda is addictive... 
Yes soda is addictive. Stop ignoring issues and trying to blame everything on the government. 
Merely stating point of fact. I let you draw your own conclusions. 
Well they do actually have to carry and birth any children that get produced.

Six oz is more than a mouthful.... A shot of whisky is an oz... maybe oz and a half if they poor a strong one - Try taking a mouthful of six oz of whiskey. 
Where in my comment led you to that illogical conclusion?
Because they love it. 
The argument is that it would reduce individual liberty. Do you disagree? 
food

noun: food; plural noun: foods

any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plants absorb, in order to maintain life and growth.

"we need food and water"
synonyms:
nourishment, sustenance, nutriment, fare

Yes I am.
Yeah, but those are taxed like soda cause they have added sugar, right?
A lot of people drink soda with their meals, so an average of two a day really isn't surprising.
Being fat is an unhealthy lifestyle but consuming unhealthy foods, drinks, smoking, etc with the knowledge it will damage your health is an unhealthy practice. Either we live in a society that doesn't allow obese people to claim public healthcare or we use unhealthy practices to fund these systems so obese people aren't denied care. 
So is being stupid.

Do you really want to risk your income to a "stupid tax"?
The overwhelming majority of tax revenues on legalized cannabis are from sales taxes, not "sin taxes".

AFAIK there isn't even a "sin tax" on cannabis in Colorado, Washington or Maine.
So be for getting the government out of healthcare completely if that's your stance.  But I'm not selfish enough to think that just because a few of my tax dollars are going to healthcare means I have a right to manipulate people into living how I demand.  

This is the one thing that scares the fuck out of me on single payer.  I want everyone to get the healthcare they need and be able to live live how they choose.  But many people will use this "help" to micromanage people's lives.  That's unacceptable.

"There is no standard size for a single shot, except in Utah, where a shot is defined as 1.5 US fl oz (44 ml). Elsewhere in the U.S., the standard size is generally considered to be 1.25–1.5 US fl oz (37–44 ml)." - Wikipedia.

And the story's not about whiskey- it's about soda. I have indeed grabbed a 'small' (12 oz) drink, and drained it halfway in one mouthful. Okay, maybe two.  Point remains- 6 oz is too little.

A standard shot glass is 1.5oz. Some bars do 1oz happy hour shots, but 1.5oz is standard.
I quoted that part.

And the current methods don't?!?
Soda isn't nourishment
Not if they don't have added sweeteners.

Lol, oh god forbid there's some sort of consequence for people who choose to live unhealthy lives 

Singlepayer would be great too. Add in a fat tax on top of it so that overweight people have to pay more into the system since they'll take more out. Tax tabacco and alcohol and feed it into the system since the consequences will take more out.

Responsibility. God forbid we have some.
I support tobacco and soda tax all day long.  Make it prohibitively expensive.  If you choose to make yourself a fattie (which will eventually have a large healthcare cost) then you can pay a bit in advance.  
You linked a picture of a Dr. Pepper can. I just browsed through all their press releases since December of 2015 and I didn't see a single mention of Dr. Pepper.  

Edit: are you sure you're not confusing Coke owning Dr Pepper Snapple Group with the fact that they typically partner in serving machines and grocery aisles? 
Yes, that is a picture of a Dr Pepper can
I hate this kind of bullshit. If I decry one party, I obviously support the other party. NO NO NO. I can despise both parties equally and I lay the blame of the mess this country is in on BOTH of them.

When I said I hated Hillary, I was called a Trump supporter. When I said I hated Trump, I was called a Hillary supporter. It's BULLSHIT because I didn't like EITHER assnipple.

Both parties have had many opportunities over the past 50+ years to lead this country and look where we are now.
Some ppl believe both sides are fucked. Also there are more than two parties  in the  US 
>"wack jobs across **both** party lines."

What to try again?
And how's that "power" working out for "you"?
I dunno, maybe. But whether or not we give men more rights, we shouldn't take away rights from women. 
And if the man decides to have an abortion I take it you don't see it going the other way? 
Yes, well - if you drank soda like whiskey... maybe people wouldn't be obese... just a thought.
A 12oz soda lasts me past a fast food meal. Maybe you should like, drink soda slower than that. 
So you're a pig who shoves large amounts of soda in their mouth at once, ok.

That's not standard
I guess "back in my day" standard pours were 1 oz  shots but that was 15 years ago.
Again, how do you arrive at your conclusion from the quoted section?  It makes no sense.

We are talking about Pennsylvania's ability to tax its citizens - and you talk about the constitution of the United States of America. 
And he has to pay a sin tax depending on how he uses it. 
The argument is that sin taxes reduce individual liberty.
Find me a juice that is 5-10% juice and does not have added sweeteners. That's why it's not 100%, because of the sugar water...
But the government does provide healthcare to all seniors and to the poor. That's the big issue you have people like smokers becoming a strain on the system and the only way to cover the increased cost is through taxing tobacco. Yes how the money is handled right now is bad but let's not act like these issues don't follow people into elderly age and do not contribute to higher costs.
We stand to save more Americans by implementing a "stupid tax".
> Lol, oh god forbid there's some sort of consequence for people who choose to live unhealthy lives 

I guess being sick, hurt, and living a lower quality of life is just not enough for you?  You gotta fuck them over more?

>Responsibility.

I guess older generations were just the most irresponsible people without the government micromanaging their lives and people being free to make bad choices.  Because that's all I want, their freedom.  You don't want to have taxes pay for healtcare?  Fine.  But don't act like you're doing some huge service by giving that money, but then using it as a backdoor to harm others.
Then you're a selfish asshole in my book.  I bet you aren't perfect yourself and cost society through your actions in a number of ways.  Should we open that all up and micromanage your life too?  I bet not.
I know.  That's why we voted Trump.  You're welcome.  
Ah I did that didn't I.  Well shit you got me.

Reminds me of a story I heard once: One day an old man is sitting on a park bench with a bag of popcorn, feeding the birds. After some time a little boy comes along and sits on the bench next to the old man and begins to read a book. As he's reading his book, he pulls a candy bar from his pocket and begins to eat it. Much to the old man's surprise, when the boy finishes the candy bar, he produces a second from another pocket and begins to eat it as well. The old man watches in disbelief when the boy bolts the second candy bar, only to draw a third from yet another pocket and begin to consume it as eagerly as the first two. Unable to keep silent any longer, the old man leans over to the little devourer of candy bars and says, "You know, little boy, you shouldn't eat candy bars like that. Your teeth will rot, you will get fat, and you will die an early death. You should eat popcorn, like I feed to these healthy birds." The little boy looks up from his book, looks thoughtfully at the old man a moment, and says, "You know, my granddad lived to be 98 years old, and was healthy everyday of his life." The old man smiles patronizingly and asks, "Did your grandfather eat 3 candy bars in single sitting?". The little boy shakes his head and says "No, he minded his own fucking business."


Clearly we need laws to prevent this.
Thanks for the personal insult. If you've resorted to that, you must realize you don't have an actual point.

Firstly, I said "small drink". Not "soda"- drink. Water, to be precise.  My point still stands- 6 ounces is just a mouthful.

Second- As for what's 'standard'- have you seen the obesity rates in the USA?
My back in my day isn't far off from that.  Maybe just different bars and places.  Most bartenders I know go with 1.5oz.  It's funny that after a quick google search only one state as an official shot size, Utah.  To go metric it makes more sense.  A mini bottle is an even 50ml, or 1.69oz.  I say we just need to do more research.

You claimed the Constitution doesn't apply at the state level.

You're wrong.
Well why pay any taxes at all?


There should be no taxes whatsoever since taxes infringe on liberty.
You are free to still buy whatever you want. Now restrictions on being able to buy it aka making requirements on how you can get say an abortion or on building requirements to get an abortion or anything else is reducing liberty. Making a sales tax 10% instead of 8% doesn't

I have a fuckin genetic disease dont talk to me about lower quality of life you hack,

If you want to actively make yourself unhealthier, you should expect to pay more for those things that make you unhealthy since it impacts ALL of society as well. Fuck off you selfish 'I should get to do whatever I want cuz freedum' prick. They're still FREE TO MAKE THE CHOICE, no one is taking those things away ffs, it costs a bit more money tho since it impacts the health system everyone is tied to.
Asshole, yes.  Selfish, nah not really.
As if more people actually voted for Trump
Gorsuch is also not going to be overturning shit. He's an originalist.

So when does the "winning" start?
You believe the man should have the ability to override the women if she wants an abortion shouldn't the man be able to override her if she doesn't want an abortion or she doesn't want to give it up for adoption? Does it go both ways or are you really trying to just block the abortion at all costs
[deleted]
It would be fine - if I didn't have to subsidize their healthcare. 
no, we just need to have people who do shit that's bad for them expect to pay for it
A mouthful of you're a squirrel
I did not claim that at all, in fact - I asked you a question which you ignored.
I disagree. Taxes are in important part of redistributing wealth. 
And then we come back to, would putting a sin tax on abortion reduce liberty if everyone was able to get one with no restrictions? Other than the sin tax. 
So, I think the mistake is assuming that if it's 5-10% juice, then it's bad. It's bad because it has added sugar, which causes it to be 5-10% juice.

I think what you linked is just watered down, is that right?

Anyway, I think part of the problem is we're lumping all non-100% juices together.
> I have a fuckin genetic disease dont talk to me about lower quality of life you hack,

I'll talk with you about whatever the fuck I want thank you.  You haven't removed that choice from me yet.  I am done here since you just gloss over every point I make and just repeat your same shit.

>If you want to actively make yourself unhealthier, you should expect to pay more for those things that make you unhealthy since it impacts ALL of society as well.

Umm, they already do.  You want to add more and more until you force others to change against their wills.  
>ck off you selfish 'I should get to do whatever I want cuz freedum' prick. They're still FREE TO MAKE THE CHOICE

NO THEY DO NOT.  YOU ARE TAKING IT  AWAY BY MAKING THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM.  IT TAKES AWAY MORE CHOICE THE MORE POOR THE PERSON IS WHICH IS DOUBLY UNFAIR.  DID CAPS MAKE ME RIGHT?  And yes, you are a selfish fucking prick for forcing this shit on others.
Thinking about yourself over others is the very definition of selfish.
Mob mentality opposes our constitution and threatens to destroy democracy.  That's why our forefathers opposed it so strongly.   
What do you think I want him to do? 
[deleted]
Sounds reasonable to me, more so than asking the government to act like everyone's mother.
You don't. If you don't want your tax dollars being used to subsidize healthcare, vote for candidates who agree those dollars should not be used for that purpose. 
They will. When they die at 39 years old.
> I did not claim that at all, in fact

So now you're claiming you didnt write this:

> what does the constitution have to do with this - that applies to the federal government
And in a society that provides medical care for old and poor people we should use sin taxes to pay for the increased cost from their choices.
Reduce liberty no as you would still have access to said abortion however​ and abortion is often much healthier then carring out the child and would be more akin to a sin tax on water not alcohol
> I think what you linked is just watered down, is that right?

Does it fucking matter?

You denied that it even exists.

It does. Q.E.D.
Lol, yeah ok Im the selfish one for wanting people to fairly pay into the system the share they'll take. I have the choice to blow my money on stupid shit that doesn't mean I do. Same with these people. no schmuck deserves a soda and if it costs 1.33 more and they cant afford it then there are other priorities- these aren't fucking mutually exclusive 

k
You're thinking about it wrong.  I think there should be a sugar/corn syrup tax because the cost of obesity-related illness is a larger drag on society than people realize, and since it seems to be well-demonstrated that *some* groups of people are incapable of moderating their own behavior, then unfortunately the state must step in as "nanny" and save these people from themselves.

It has nothing do with thinking about myself, I am considering the greatest good for the greatest number of people.  The USA is getting fatter and fucking fatter, but the fatties want us to consider their feelings while they are slowly killing themselves with poor choices, emotional eating, etc. etc. etc.

All that is needed is a couple generations of disruption and then the behavior will largely become self-correcting.  People need to look at soda like a poison, or at least the same way as booze consumption has negative health consequences.  I still drink booze, but I have no illusions that it is harmful if I go crazy with it.  Look at cigarettes in the west... fewer and fewer people are picking up smoking, largely due to tax and advertising messages directed at youth, explaining the negative consequences of smoking.
What I find curious is that we haven’t heard any news about such incidents outside the US.
Can we please stop with these titles? News people?

It's 2019.
"high-flying," get it? OMG hilarious.

Honestly, the news media is more Beavis & Butthead about marijuana than actual users and it's getting super tired.
You know it’s propaganda by the tobacco companies when the article says right after announcing 530 patients have been afflicted

>Some smoked nicotine products, but many smoked marijuana...
I knew it was too good to fly under the radar forever.
The ridiculous part is it isn't even the marijuana that hurts people. Nor is it the nicotine juice that people have been doing in HUGE amounts for ten fucking years. These problems have ALL come from hacked cartridges to smoke illegal substances.

Also, anyone else think it a little too coincidental that this came by way of executive order at the exact time said executive was starting to have impeachment inquiries brought up against him?
Meanwhile, tobacco kills 1300 Americans every year.
~~But marijuana is addictive and it would be impossible for the lost souls who abuse this dangerous gateways drug to stop. Right? Because we’d be seeing an increase in sales over time regardless of the dangers, kind of like heroine and meth and coke and *opioids*! (/s)~~

~~Yeah, of course sales went down. Because marijuana isn’t addictive and many of the people who use it aren’t uninformed, suicidal, stupid, or - the most important one - addicted.~~

Obviously, the most danger will always come from black market products that are unregulated. And ~~all~~ most of the deaths have occurred in states where it is needlessly illegal to use, grow, possess, or sell marijuana and its derivatives.

Edit: updated for accurate facts, original information was based on a different article. In other words, I wasn’t paying attention.

Edit 2 : updated again for accurate facts, I found the article below to be the best explanation of why addiction was “debated”

http://healthland.time.com/2010/10/19/is-marijuana-addictive-it-depends-how-you-define-addiction/
Yea, who knew inhaling a vaporized liquid was gonna be bad for you. Stick to greens people.
There was one case in Canada, London Ontario but thats the only outside of the US that I can think of.
Well India has banned vaping but for all practical purposes only their richer tech people vape and most of the country loves tobacco and cigarettes. 

I feel that vaping as a health issue is probably something in the cartridges that we are unaware of as people have been using hookahs for a while with no incidents.
"takes a hit..."  

We get it AP news, you vape
So instead of rescheduling cannabis and drying up the black market to ensure public safety, they go directly for flavored nicotine ejuice. I have been vaping nic juice for a decade with no negative effects. It's maddening. Makes absolutely no sense. This should be pissing everyone off, but folks will just turn away if it doesn't affect them directly.
Sorry to correct you, that figure is actually [daily.](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm) It's almost 500,000 yearly.
> all of the deaths have occurred in states where it is needlessly illegal to use, grow, possess, or sell marijuana and its derivatives.

the article clearly states at least one of the deaths was in Oregon
I would argue that weed is indeed adictive. Its not bioloigical addiction but I definetly need weed to function properly. I smoke everyday and I also reeeaaally want to smoke even right after I get up in the morning.
Weed, just like literally anything else in the world, can be addicting.
People have been consuming concentrates for well over a decade now though.  What difference does it make if you buy pure distillate in a cart or choose to drop it on a quartz banger.
Chances are someone put vitamin E oil in the juice to save a buck, cuz that will kill you

It's tainted products from shifty vendors
My first guess what it was one of the liquids used to hold the flavoring and nicotine, you know the filler crap.
Exactly. Tobacco kills 1300 people daily in the U.S. alone. Ten people die from hacked cartridges = worse than tobacco? What in the serious fuck?
Thank you for the correction! I updated my original post.
Before arguing the point I looked into it and you are correct! I retracted the inaccurate information. Thanks for questioning my statements and making me take the time to update what I’ve learned.
Shifty vendors = black market Street dealers. It's all been from home brew weed carts..
The filler is typically either vegetable glycerol (used commonly in foods) or propylene glycol (used in inhalers) so both are considered safe.
If you read the article you will find that one of those deaths was from cartridges sold by a regulated Oregon dispensary
>It's all been from home brew weed carts..

E: I am editing my post.  Please stop spreading false information.  Its literally in the article about one of these deaths being linked to an Oregon regulated dispensary

[https://apnews.com/24075ddff8e448b5afe64671b23b1c8d](https://apnews.com/24075ddff8e448b5afe64671b23b1c8d)  (the article in the thread)

>Oregon, which announced its death at the beginning of the month and said it was from a vape purchased at a regulated dispensary, saw one of the biggest drops in market share for vape revenue..

Spreading false (or deliberately false) information is terrible, stop fucking doing it
That's for nicotine vapes not thc vapes
Still came from a hacked cartridge. Marijuana has NEVER killed a single human being (at least not from smoking). The issue here is non-safe mediums. Marijuana is only dangerous if you smoke it out of dangerous materials. E.G. Foil, plastic, soda cans, bic pens. Basically everything on r/stonerengineering. 

Your post serves to prove my original point further which is, This is a ridiculous over-reaction by people who do not have all of the details. We have no idea what is in these altered cartridges, but people have been smoking marijuna concentrates and vape juice for a decade now. These deaths are new.
[https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2019/2019-09-05\_vaping.htm](https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2019/2019-09-05_vaping.htm) was released back in early September clamining high amounts of Vitamin E acetate have been found in samples submitted by patients.   


Looks to me like this bit of information didn't make it onto the list of vaping talking points.
An Important thing to know is "legal dispebsary" doesn't mean it wasn't a bootleg home brew batch. There has been a major issue in Oregon and especially California of legal vendors selling black market products illegally. That being said...its all thc carts. It isn't vaping. It's improperly cheaply made black market thc carts.
All states have different testing regulations and they only test for certain things. Vitamin e acetate usually isnt something tested for. 

Anyways all sorts of business owners do shady things, could have been selling black market carts. Dispensaries get shut down for doing illegal stuff fairly often.

It would be odd that 499 people got sick from black market cartridges and 1 person got sick from a legit one. Probably would be the same thing as the other 500 cases.
>This is a ridiculous over-reaction by people who do not have all of the details. We have no idea what is in these altered cartridges, but people have been smoking marijuna concentrates and vape juice for a decade now. These deaths are new.

Yeah I'm in full agreement with you there.  I am a medical patient and get my cartridges from a dispensary who the state claims is in compliance and tests their cartridges.  What are they even testing for because an exact cause hasn't been determined.  Its fucking annoying.  I just don't think its proper to not point out that some of this is being sold in what consumers think is a legitimate store

Wow, I did not see that. Go NYS!   I am a med patient and was told by my dispensary that their catridges do not contain Vitamin E and they "comply with all state protocols" but since I'm not in NYS, my state doesn't require testing for Vit E
Were those sample from a medical dispensary? article says most vit e samples are suspected of being rec state knock offs. Just because they have a card does not mean that their "medicine" came from a dispensary.
Excellent point. The reaction is still stupid. Instead of trying to find where these hacked/black market cartridges were coming from and putting a stop to it, they just decide to tank the Juul corporation. 

Granted, it's big tobacco, I'm not shedding any tears, but it feels like that coke campaign in the 80's where Pepsi came out with Pepsi Crystal, and Coke made Coke Clear. Coke intentionally butchered it so people would associate the bad Coke Clear with Pepsi Crystal. It killed both.
Opinion piece, no sources, title clearly says 'due to vaping', which puts it clearly in the realm of the modified cartridges. On top of this, your article clearly states that this was due to respiratory failure, not overdose. Very big difference. If the article is to be believed, (IMHO not really) she took a massive hit, which gave her diminished lung capacity that never reinflated. Still no deaths due to marijuana overdose.

However, since my previous post says 'not from smoking' you are correct that smoking pot was the catalyst for her death, but I still dispute the real cause.
> Instead of trying to find where these hacked/black market cartridges were coming from and putting a stop to it, they just decide to tank the Juul corporation.

Yeah, its clear the government is not trying to help the consumer.  If they did, they would require testing of all cartridges sold, but that would require re-scheduling marijuana.
You can bet your left nut they wouldn’t withdraw if this case didn’t get any publicity
Summary:

PepsiCo had a patented special variety of potato with especially low moisture content for use specifically in Lays potato chips.
They have a licensing program with Indian farmers to allow the farmers to grow those special potatoes for PepsiCo’s exclusive use.

The sued farmers were taken to court because they somehow got their hands on the special potato’s seeds and were violating PepsiCo’s patent rights and it was jeopardizing the program with the legit licensed farmers. PepsiCo really wanted a settlement to force the violating farmers to comply with the licensing program or stop growing the infringing potatoes instead of money.
That's a wild photo they used.
The agreement was reached after Kylie Jenner reportedly walked in and started handing out cans of Pepsi.
It looks like the agreement is tentative.
What did the Indian farmers do for Pepsi to sue them?
How much is squiggle 1.05 crore?
The Question here would be if companies should be able to legally own the rights to a specific crop variety. Even if they developed it themself. Or if as soon as it occours naturally (for whatever reason) everyone should be allowed to harvest and replant that crop.
Down vote for misleading title. Should say: PepsiCo makes offensive offer to settle case
I hate the world 

We have patented fucking crops while people are out there starving
Just started to worry that there are probably a BUNCH of species of plant seeds that are already more drought resistant but no one can grow them because of genetic patents like this.
This is the same sort of BS that Monsanto does to farmers that save seeds or wind up with cross-pollenated crops due to pollen drift.  I believe that there should be patent rights on THINGS, but things that grow or can be, without undue effort, be replicated by your average layperson should not fall under these sorts of regulations.  

&#x200B;

So what, the farmers grew Lays potatoes.  How did they acquire them?  Where did they come from?  Are they being marketed and used to make bootleg Lays chips?  Did PepsiCo's mothers not love them enough as a child?  Their fathers too much?  Will these farmers represent some sort of threat against the Lays Brand?  What is the real basis for a food patent for a grown plant?

&#x200B;

Too many questions, not enough answers.
This is so flawed. Why would the private sector fund research into developing specific crop variants if the government does not protect their rights.

&#x200B;

Public memory is very short. After independence, our farmers were not able to grow enough food for Indian consumption itself. India is able to feed its population today because of the green revolution that happened because of public funded research. All the benefits of the rise in productivity have been taken by the farmers without paying the people whose research caused the rise in productivity.

&#x200B;

Now when the private sector has invested time and money in research to come up with better breeds using selective breeding (in this case) and in some cases even scientific tools like gene editing to increase productive yield and desired characteristics in crops, the farmers want to take these benefits for free as well?

&#x200B;

Few farmers had contracted with Pepsi for growing specific potatoes for Lays chips. After the contract ended, the farmers were free to grow the regular potatoes they were growing earlier, no one forced them to grow Lays' proprietary version. Out of their greed, these farmers are surreptitiously growing Pepsi's version, which they will undoubtedly sell to Haldiram or other competitors, thus nullifying Pepsi's advantage and huge R&D investment.

&#x200B;

If this sets any precedent, Pepsi will either:

1. take over land for farming themselves, in friendly jurisdictions, or
2. make genetic modifications to the potatoes so they are sterile in the next generation

&#x200B;

In no way is this a victory for the greedy farmers, for the larger public, for innovation or for private sector investments into science.
I’ve been boycotting all soft drinks for like 10 years.  They are feeling the pressure. 

You’re welcome, potato farmers.
Peace was only reached after Kendall Jenner showed up and offered Pepsi for everyone
It seems the title is misleading.  PepsiCo India is agreeing to withdraw the lawsuit if the farmers work out a deal with PepsiCo, buy the seeds from, and sell back grown potatos to PepsiCo or destroying current stock and not growing those type of potato again.  The next hearing is June 12th.
If you have a patent don’t you *have* to defend it or risk losing it? 

Also considering that they are able to get the seeds and then sell the potatoes to PepsiCo it seems like pretty steady work unless they’re really ripping them off on what they’re buying the potatoes for
A company can't own a vegetable. Next, they'll want to own water or something.
*Let them eat potatoes!*
Too little too late. No more Pepsi for me! #BoycottPepsi
What leverage did they have over India anyway? What were they gonna do, make them serve Coke?
[deleted]
pepsico sux....they refuse to release formula, or bring back, josta. assholes.
I mean what could they do anyhow?
I wish it wasn't too much to ask for corporations to live in harmony with their ecosystem.  One doesn't have to be a shark in a fish tank, you can just say what you want to do and what you will need to accomplish it.  Simple, and doesn't get people pissed off at you.
Just plant the potatoes from the crop randomly throughout the country forests ...wonder who will they sue then?
something something kendall jenner
exposure can be a bitch
You have it backwards. The entire point of the case was for the publicity to get it communicated that if your steal their products, they will pursue legal action. It's a warning to other potato farmers.
Disagree. IANAL but in my limited knowledge of certain laws and this particular situation it seems like Pepsi would have likely dropped the issue or asked for a lesser settlement. The whole point of this exercise in legal futility seems just for precedent so they can claim they attempted to defend their trademark. Would love if someone with legal expertise in this could give their insights and or corrections.
I don't get it why people are against PepsiCo here? PepsiCo was in the right.

Those farmers were in the wrong... they knew they were in the wrong.

It's like taking pity on a robber, because he went to jail for robbing a millionaire.

Sure... the millionaire has lots of money... and the 100 bucks the robber stole, is nothing to the millionaire. But that's still a crime. The robber is still on the wrong here.

Reddit has this "against corporation" mentality that things everything corporations do are wrong. (With the exception of a few, like Elon Musk's ones)
Did you bet yours? From the article it seems they dropped it because the government is looking at changing how they deal with seeds and ip.

This is a win for PepsiCo
I would but after I lost it in the last bet I'm all right.
The people ordering the withdrawal probably wouldn't have _known_ about it without the publicity. Can't keep track of every little case your soulless lawyers come up with.
The farmers need to file a group action and make PepsiCo defend their predatory actions or accept a default judgment.
It's really sad how obvious it is that the top upvoted commenter hasn't read the article once you've read it....  and most likely all the people that upvoted as well.
It's all because of them sponsoring T-series no doubt. #thankyoupewdipie
You might want to add " [farmers groups are pointing out that the law allows them to grow and sell any variety of crop or even seed as long as they don’t sell branded seed of registered varieties](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/potato-farmers-cry-foul-as-pepsico-sues-them/article26936480.ece)"

Basically this was a strong arm tactic that failed because the farmers were able to get the money needed to fight the lawsuit.
>Indian farmers... grow those special potatoes...

>they somehow got their hands on the special potato’s seeds...

Gee, I wonder how that could have happened.
The perspective made it look like he was holding massive potatoes.
The nine farmers were allegedly growing PepsiCo's registered potato variety which is used for Lays chips.
u/10ebbor10 is incorrect. 1.05 crore is 10.5 million rupees with the exchange rate being ~70 rupees to every USD, its actually about ~$150,000 USD.
1.05 crore is 10.5 million rupees.

That's about 15 000 USD.
Anything that was created by nature is fair game to grow.  Only plants that people have worked to develop are patentable, and only if they're fairly recent (due to patent expiration).  So if there are a "BUNCH" of plants that are more drought resistant that aren't developed by man, then people are free to grow them.  And if there are a "BUNCH" that are older, then people are free to grown them.  Only if they are developed recently by man, then you have to pay the people that developed them to grow them, and that seems reasonable to pay the inventor for their invention.
>This is the same sort of BS that Monsanto does to farmers that save seeds or wind up with cross-pollenated crops due to pollen drift.

Save seeds yes, pollen drift no. Accidental vs intentional is a major factor.

> I believe that there should be patent rights on THINGS, but things that grow or can be, without undue effort, be replicated by your average layperson should not fall under these sorts of regulations.

Why not? The point of the patent system is to encourage expensive innovation by giving the innovator a temporary monopoly on his invention. You'd think that the easier the replication is, the more important the patent is.

>Will these farmers represent some sort of threat against the Lays Brand?

If Lays fails to defend their patent in one situation, then that becomes a precedent which allows the validity of the patent to be challenged. That is a threat.
You do know how potatoes are grown right?  Someone who had an agreement to grow said potatoes for Lays clearly stole or failed to prevent someone else from stealing the potatoes from their field or manufacturing somehow.  9 Seperate people dont "accidentally" grow a tuber that grows underground.
There are plenty of answers, you just didn't look because they wouldn't serve your rhetoric.
More likely Pepsi uses the patent as a means to force the farmers to sell the potatoes only to them, lowering the market value of the potatoes by removing alternative buyers.
That hurts the potato farmer.
Defend it in the locality where it exists.  Law in India allows for an absolute right to seed crop, PepsiCo only owns the exclusive right to selling under the brand name.
Is someone inventing a new form of water?  That seems literally impossible given that water really doesn't have any way to invent a new version.
They have tried not joking either.
"Ill have a rum and coke."  
"Is Pepsi ok?"  
"Can I pay with monopoly money?"
How dare Pepsi enforce intellectual property rights.
what makes you think that?
They didn't withdraw because they wouldn't win. They withdrew because it got too much publicity.
You think they didn’t send a C&D first?
Yup. People die from exposure.
How does dropping a case send a warning to other farmers?
The entire point was PepsiCo thought they could assert invalid claims against poor farmers.  The local statutes were very clear, PepsiCo needs to be taught a lesson for this.
I don't think it's even about stealing the products - they were being sued for *marketing* the products using "Lay's" branding.
History is told by those left standing.
What legal action? They are withdrawing cases.. they know it'll be worse if they pursue it any more. The farmers are in the right. They did not break any of their laws.
I'm not gonna lie, I bought a bag of lays potato chips when I heard the original news. And now that it's back in my mind again I'm going to buy some more.
It's pretty much a "we really don't care about 9 Indian potato farmers, but if we let this slide then it would just lead to more people stealing our products".

More of a warning than anything else.
> asked for a lesser settlement

They originally stated that would drop the lawsuit if the farmers agreed to no longer growing that particular variety, or simply sell all of that particular variety to pepsico.
This is Reddit, I'm sure a poor man's version of Charlie Kelly will pipe in at any moment.
While legally they arent going to lose their trademark to abandonment if they didnt prosecute, they still want to send a message they are defending the trademark.  They only pulled it because of the backlash costing them more in the long run than letting 9 indian guys sell fake Lays chips.
This always gets me wondering--can you trademark/copyright something so no one else can do this? It seems like if you do own a trademark, then you have to prevent others from using it, otherwise it becomes void and someone else can pick it up. What if you believe that your design/logo/brand/etc. should be allowed to be used freely by everyone?
Pepsi really was really angling for a cease-and-desist order or settlement from the courts more than licensing fees.
INAL, I am an Australian penguin.

PepsiCo attempted to enforce an unenforceable contract on poor farmers.  The local statute allows for retention and growing of any seed, the only allowable restriction is on selling the produce with the trademark name.  PepsiCo was acting in a predatory manner and suing the poor farmers for an enormous sum of money, PepsiCo should lose and be shamed.

The ownership of a hybrid or GMO product is a modern construct that is largely restricted to countries in the West.  Some countries allow the poor to attempt to better their lives through work.
PepsiCo owns the patent to potatoes? I think your thinking is demented. When a corporation starts patenting human genes, will that corporation then own humans who have that gene? stfu.
How are they robbers?. They had to buy the seed potatoes from someone. They didn't pull them out of their ass. Maybe Pepsi should speak to their "partners".
Except the farmers getting sued were marketing the potatoes using the Lays branding.

The point is, PepsiCo *has* to pay for an investigation and prosecution of patent / trademark infringers or risk losing rights to the brand name - just like Kleenex (vs facial tissues) or Xerox (photocopiers) or even Jake Brakes (diesel engine brake brand).

Edit: People are asking for sources.

Basically it was some farmers doing wrong but it happens to be legal. But they were poor... so it is ok. Right?

This was dropped because 
>“After discussions with the Government, the Company has agreed to withdraw cases against farmers. We are relying on the said discussions to find a long term and an amicable resolution of all issues around seed protection,” said a PepsiCo spokesperson on Thursday.

So this protection might not exist for much longer, and that is a good thing.
They kept their *eyes* out for them
And massive hands too.

That's why fishermen hold their arms as far out as they can....
Peak late stage capitalism: thinking you own genetic information
Either value of which would probably destroy a rural Indian potato farmer. All for something that likely has no real effect on PepsiCo.
That's about *150,000* USD.
Thanks. Reddit is weird sometimes. I usually look up things, but writing squiggle struck me funny.
They didn't invent a potato they modified it. I guess we'll be making genetically cloned & modified humans next, it'll be okay because it's a patented invention that took a lot of R&D effort.
I suppose next they'll sue licensed producers of weed for dare growing strains that have existed because they hold some "patent" or claim on it.
I mean I guess but *temporary* monopoly? lol
Just because you can patent a vegetable doesn’t mean you should. Capitalism though.
Trademarks are a per country protection as designated in local laws.  India only recognizes the brand name in this case.  PepsiCo was being predatory against poor farmers in a way not allowed under the local statutes.
If patents were 20 year terms still, I'd say you have a point.  As it is now, companies just get free protection without having to ever give back to the communities that enable that protection.
Potatoes will grow anywhere.  Accidentally or otherwise.
Seed crop is an absolute right in India.  PepsiCo is only afforded ownership of the trademark name.
These potatoes are Pepsi's specific breed. They are not available in the open market except when farmers leak them to other farmers under brown-bag laws.

If farmers are growing them, they got the parent potatoes from Pepsico/Lays under contract to grow only for a season, but are continuing to grow them to sell to Haldiram or other competitors at a price \*higher\* than regular potatoes due to the better breed.

&#x200B;

So these potatoes should not be available for sale in the market; they were developed by Pepsi for use in Pepsi products. These potatoes are not being grown for the farmer's consumption. They will be sold to Pepsi's competition, enabling their chips to taste like Lays.

&#x200B;

Imagine if you created a textbook for use in your own tuition classes, using your own money, and after getting great results, some student just copied them to sell to some competitor tuition classes to improve their results?

Would you be supportive of that?
I didn’t say I boycott chips.
A potato remains a potato, doesn't it? If we start down that road, the descendants of Native Americans may have the official rights to chocolate and cacao beans overall. I mean, they figured out how to use the beans to create that very special treat. Instead, the colonists just killed a lot of them, stole their lands, and to this day block their descendants from reaching their rightful territories.

And this reminds me that I count as a Native American descendant too!

Where's Nestle at? I need to talk to them about how they're using my ancestors' proprietary cacao beans.
It's going to be a dangerous world in the near future, as water as a resource becomes increasingly hard to come by. Judging from this, people will end up begging corporations to let them access drinking water.
Yeah if we didn't let people like Pepsi control seed patents internationally then what motivation would people like Pepsi have to develop unique oh wait
No... They withdrew because government is offering to work with them on a solution... It's still the very beginning of the article...
I was referring to the corporation's behavior, not the people's.
And so do stock prices.
They didnt drop it.  They settled it with requirements that they destroy all their crops.
well, the farmers either join their pepsi farmer coop or they destroy their existing stock. Under these conditions they will withdraw their suit. Meaning if they don´t do either, pepsi will continue their legal action.
PepsiCo is a rich corporation, the lesson for them would only be how much it costs to use lawyers to hurt people.
It wasn't the branding, they were growing a specific variety of potatoes that PepsiCo developed and holds the rights to.
This seems like Disney’s fault
Some nations don't allow for ridiculous overreach.  PepsiCo would lose this case in India, it's absurd and predatory.
> What if you believe that your design/logo/brand/etc. should be allowed to be used freely by everyone?

A couple of examples: https://opensource.org/trademark, https://opensource.org/licenses, https://www.oshwa.org/faq/, https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage/

There are others in the Free/Open Source community.
Neither would happen in India, PepsiCo attempted to violate local laws and assert unenforceable contracts.  The farmers have an absolute right to retain seed crop, only selling under the brand name is protected.
I'll just Copy/paste a response I gave to people complaining about patented crops.
______________

Cause that's actually a very good way to make better crops.

I know you are not truly interested in learning... and just wanna rage against big evil corporations... but without patented plants... we probably wouldn't be feeding 8 billions people like we are now.

For example. I want to develop a variety of rice that has double the yield of the current one. I spend 5 millions dollars in this endeavor. In the end I'm successful, and sell seeds of my rice variety to farmers. First year I get some farmers interested in my seeds, and make a profit of 100 thousand. Second year... farmers are really impressed with my seed... so the number of farmers using them increase by 8. But I make only 50 thousand. Because last years farmers, are using the seeds they get from the rice they planted... and some are even selling seeds to other farmers for a fraction of what I was selling.

The farmer selling my seed, doesn't need to recoup the 5 millions I spent developing that variety. And soon... several people are selling my seed, and I get nothing. I invested all that money... made a rice variety that will help feed billions of people... and am 4,85 millions dollars poorer because of it.

Nobody would invest into improving our existent crops, to make them taste better, grow faster, have bigger yields, be pest resistant (decreasing the use of pesticides), etc... If they couldn't recoup the millions of dollars needed create these varieties, and also turn a profit.

But also people recognize that if someone invents a good variety, it shouldn't be held for ever by some corporation... cause that actually decrease innovation. People should be able to after a time... try to improve on my variety, mix with another variety, and things like that.

That's why patents have a time of 20 years. I have 20 years to recoup my investment... make a profit... and after 20 years... anyone can plant, sell, buy, etc... my variety without need to pay royalties to me.
Knowingly buying stolen property then?
First... the robber thing was an analogy.

Second... potatoes don't have seeds. Potatoes grown from potatoes.

Those farmers were licensed to plant them in the past... but decided they no longer wanted to grow potatoes for PepsiCo. That's fine... no problem.

BUT... they kept some Pepsi's potatoes from the previous harvest to grown them.

They did technically stole. They knew what they were doing was illegal and wrong.
Did you happen to have a link saying they were branding them as lays? I haven't seen anywhere reporting that.
That generification of trademarks is such a devastating economic loss is a myth dreamed up by bored corporate lawyers. If we suddenly started calling all cola pepsi tomorrow, I bet PepsiCo would make more money, not less.
Prove that. No article has even state that.
INAL

It was a protected and absolute right for the farmers to save seed crop.  PepsiCo could not enforce a contract in violation of the law.  PepsiCo would have likely lost all their trademarks in India had they attempted to go any further.
Is it really a good thing? It completely removes any incentive to make better varieties of plants. If you spend thousands of hours of doctoral level expert knowledge creating something and all the money in resources testing it to see if it is better, then someone just takes your hard work for free and competes directly against you using your own product with no investment in development, is that a good thing? Should I be able to pirate any computer program and sell pirate copies to make a living? Should I be able to reproduce songs and movies and sell them for a living?
Is that a Mr potato Head reference?
Its not the only massive thing about him
Same. I had it in my mind that PepsiCo had created some sort of mutant super-potatoe that grows as big as a cantaloupe.
[deleted]
Yea the farmers broke the agreement. It's fair to agree to something, then have consequences for the violating party.
In senior year of high school we did a report on gmo. I vaguely remember the back story of the papaya plant essentially There was a disease wiping them out and a gmo company edited their genie make up and saved the papaya plant. However this meant that company literally owned the papaya industry since they created a brand new product. And the natural papayas are eradicated.
If you spent millions developing it and it wouldn't have happened in nature by itself...
Why?

If you essentially invent a new variety of a plant, why should you get exclusive rights for a couple decades?

Why should other people be able to just steal your invention if they did not pay any r&d money for it?
... so?
"Its ok officer, I didnt do enough damage to cause any lasting harm!"
You won't own your own genes, and could be sued for theft if you have the genes and attempt to reproduce.
> They didn't invent a potato they modified it.

Most inventions are modifications of prior art.  But here's a response that I made to someone else that tried that bullshit:

>> invent - create or design (something that has not existed before); be the originator of.

> So, given that definition, are you saying that the new potatoes that these people created, often from a plan or design that they or others created, is not an invention, and if so, precisely what part of the definition of "invent" is not satisfied simply because the invention is organic?

> There's no restriction to invention that says "must be inorganic," so that can't be the reason. 

Now, as for humans, nothing about patenting makes human cloning illegal or legal.  They're not related at all really.  Nothing about patent law says "Well, even if this is illegal, it's now legal because it's on patent".  Further, the ethics of cloning and modifying humans isn't set anyway, so it may be okay simply because we decide that it's okay.   Unless you can explain how what you just said makes sense, it's nonsense at best, because nothing about human cloning and modification has anything to do with this conversation overall, other than that if it's legal otherwise, such discoveries would be patentable.  And if it did take a lot of R&D effort, then it's rational that we'd allow patenting it.  Also, since that would be new *controversial* technology, it will almost definitely come with new regulations, as that's how we react to new technology.  We can debate this with facts and reason, or you can go "OMG, human cloning!" but we can't do both.
You can't patent inventions that already exist.  "Strains that have existed" would be unpatentable due to prior art. Only if they're new inventions would they be able to patent a strain, meaning that all of the current strains would be protected from being patentable.  

Please, learn about the basics of patent law before speaking out.  You just replied to my comment twice, and yet neither of them makes any sense.
If you invent that vegetable, you should if you want to.  Why should everyone else get what you invented for free?  If they don't want to pay extra, why can't they grow what was available before you invented it?

If you invented a new wheel, you'd patent it correct?  So why should the biologist that invents a new ear of corn get fucked over by not being able to patent it?
Ahh, there it is, that word capitalism again, I was asked if I was having a stroke this morning on here by ranting against today's corporate culture and mass theft from the middle class.
Patents are 20 years long.

I think you're confusing them with copyright.
But not an entire field's worth.
No, you clearly don't know how potato cultivation works.
Under laws, the farmers are afforded the right to seed crop.  Let PepsiCo develop sterile new crops, this is why the seed crop law exists.  Should PepsiCo develop new variations of crops that are inherently sterile, I foresee none of their IP being enforceable in India.
Complementary goods.
> A potato remains a potato, doesn't it?

If this is your view, then why not say that the farmers can grow any other potato?  But tell me, if "A potato remains a potato", which I read as you saying that the differences are pointless, then how do you explain the massive variations in flavor, consistency, color, texture, nutritional value, and size that we see from various strains of potatoes?  

> If we start down that road, the descendants of Native Americans may have the official rights to chocolate and cacao beans overall. 

No, because patent rights last 20 years.  Not literally centuries.  

> Where's Nestle at? I need to talk to them about how they're using my ancestors' proprietary cacao beans.

No, you need to learn about patent law before you object to it.  Righteous indignation is not a substitute for understanding.

If you want to talk about how the colonists treated the Native Americans, then feel free, but let's keep that conversation to history discussions, and maybe some policy discussions, not patent law, which is unrelated to that discussion in its entirety.
Yes. You said why can’t the corporations  just say what they want, presumably without suing first, right?  Unless I’m misunderstanding that line?
I exposed myself once. Would not recommend.
For an average Of 7 days; so people just buy the dip
Perhaps, but not in this case they don't.  It's been relatively smooth sailing for Pepsico stock as of late.
That's not at all what the article states.
I foresee PepsiCo losing all their IP for this.
India allows the sale of such patented crops without a license so long as you don't market it as the patented varietal.
Fucking Thanos!
If it's for the good of humanity, then fuck corporate profits. You rather people starve for being a greedy bastard?
>> BUT... they kept some Pepsi's potatoes from the previous harvest to grown them

You realize that Indian law allows the farmers to do this?
Yeah, if that was the case than it would probably just be a breach of contract since they probably had a contract stating that they had to give them all back or destroy them.

However, there is such thing as a "seed potato" but it isn't an actual seed. It's the sprouted potato that you plant to grow more potatoes.
I am a penguin, INAL.

The legal statute uses seed defined to include all manner of initial means for generating produce.

It was not illegal for the farmers to retain seed crop.  The local statute specifically protects this right.  The trademark only protects from selling under the brand name in India.  PepsiCo was acting in a predatory manner against poor farmers.
They did not market under the brand name.  PepsiCo is predatory and attempting to enforce an unenforceable contract in violation of an absolute right to retain seed.
It was mentioned in one of the reports - the farmers were claiming the potatoes were Lay’s to an undercover buyer / investigator PepsiCo had hired as part of the due diligence before the lawsuit. Of the top of my head it was either mentioned in one of the first news podcasts to cover it (NPR Up First, BBC Global News, or NKH News) or one of the early articles before all the media conglomerates decided to go with the “big corporation screws little farmer” byline for the greater marketshare.
Even in the US, once the general public accepts a name as a general term there is no protection. (Ex. Elevator)
It Is protected, that does not make it a good thing. The argument that it is legal to do something is not always the best argument. 

We dont know for sure about your second claim, they dropped the case because they are in talks with the government to change things.

Your last claim I'd not really backed up by anything.
People have been making better varieties of plants since the dawn of civilization. 

>  It completely removes any incentive to make better varieties of plants.

That's utter nonsense. The motivating factor for Pepsi even in this case was to make the Lays production easier (less moisture). Also first mover advantage is a major thing.
Hyperbolic arguments with absolutist language are not valid.

India allowing local farmers to grow and sell produce has not prevented PepsiCo from recouping its investment.  Not every country accepts irresponsible ownership to the detriment of their populous.

PepsiCo owns the brands.  PepsiCo sells finished products not the preproducts used in their manufacturing methods.  There is no direct competition between these poor farmers and PepsiCo.
No, it a reference to how potatoes are actually propagated
IIRC this is not a genetically modified crop. It's just a particular variety/breed. You can patent/trademark non-GMOs, and it's actually very common in agriculture.
I mean im not so sure.  If they actually used crisper which would be real recently than I guess, but if this is a special potatoe they have been using for awhile then likely they found it through testing and searching.
I think rightly or wrongly people don't think of crops as something that should be copyrighted because they're too important. They think, would Norman Borlaug have sued these farmers? Most agricultural plants and animals were bred by someone at some point so are they all public domain schematics or what? As they are replaced by modern scientific breeds does that mean the future has no place for generic unbranded potatoes, corn, sheep, cows etc? There's been too many stories about some large company strong-arming their way into a local industry with, yes, a more efficient method, but taking ownership of something that used to belong to all.
It's not a gmo, but a specific breed pepsi made for their chips
[deleted]
[deleted]
The potato variety in question is not a GMO.
No, but maybe this is the equivalent of having to buy someone a new car because you hit theirs with your door.  

It sounds like the farmers saved some of the previous years crop to use as seed potatoes.
Agree to disagree, we didn't need this before now, because, crony capitalism.
Maybe they should do the dirty work and grow it themselves then rather than paying for cheap labour to do it, if they're \*that\* worried about it being grown elsewhere. That's what corporations do normally when they wish to protect valuable trade secrets. Using the legal system all because they can't be bothered to pay a fair wage when hiring others to grow their own genetically modified spuds. It's essentially offloading their own legal battles to the taxpayers. What do you expect though from Big Sugar American capitalism, causing massive healthcare issues in the world over.
Nice strawman argument. Nobody in the history of the world has invented a vegetable, or a fruit. That’s not how this works, that’s not how any of this works. 


So these scientists invented potatoes? They should get the Nobel prize for inventing organic material. Maybe we should worship them instead of any kind of god.
The status quo is the status quo for a reason.
Lays has been making potato chips for far more than 20 years.
The current instance is a case of conflict between Farmers' rights and Breeders rights, where Pepsico has licensed the Breeders' rights from the original breeder. This act is being misused by greedy farmers.

&#x200B;

If the farmers wanted to cultivate potatoes, why not cultivate *regular* potatoes? **Why do they have to steal the very** ***specific*** **potato variants paid for by Pepsico and given to few farmers under contract?** The answer is simple, they are planning to sell these potatoes to Pepsico's competitors like Haldirams and Diamond, to make potato chips similar to Lays in quality. Implicitly this means they will be selling it for its qualities as a branded variant and not as just any potato.

&#x200B;

This is blatantly unfair to Pepsico who has paid for the development and research of this selective breed, and licensed the same from the original breeder. The PPVFR Act clearly recognizes that breeders rights need to be protected when new variants are derived from their breeds:

&#x200B;

*\[30\] ... "the authorisation of the breeder of a registered variety is required where the repeated use of such variety as a parental line is necessary for commercial production of such other newly developed variety."*

&#x200B;

At the same time the act gives farmers higher rights over breeders rights, which seems incompatible with the protection of breeders rights:

&#x200B;

*\[39\]\[1\]\[iv\] "a farmer shall be deemed to be entitled to save, use, sow resow, exchange, share or sell his farm produce including seed of a variety protected under this Act in the same manner as he was entitled before the coming into force of this Act, provided that the farmer shall not be entitled to sell branded seed of a variety protected under this Act. \[...\] “branded seed” means any seed put in a package or any other container and labelled in a manner indicating that such seed is of a variety protected under this Act."*

&#x200B;

Note that the farmers are doing this to earn additional profits from selling these potatoes to Pepsico competitors. This means they are planning on selling the potatoes not as merely any potato, but as a variant good for potato chips. So regardless of if they put the potatoes in "a package or container labelled" or not, the intent is of selling it based on the fact that it is a branded variant.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the act leniently provides an escape route for infringing farmers, contrary to the well-established legal dictum that ignorance of the law is no defence:

&#x200B;

*\[42\] "Protection of innocent infringement.—Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act,— (i) a right established under this Act shall not be deemed to be infringed by a farmer who at the time of such infringement was not aware of the existence of such right; and (ii) a relief which a court may grant in any suit for infringement referred to in section 65 shall not be granted by such court, nor any cognizance of any offence under this Act shall be taken, for such infringement by any court against a farmer who proves, before such court, that at the time of the infringement he was not aware of the existence of the right so infringed."*

&#x200B;

Still I think with good lawyers, Pepsico could have shown that these farmers' actions were malicious. The farmers were clearly aware of the agreement, and even if not, they cannot finally sell it without naming the variant, so at that time they will run afoul of the law.

&#x200B;

*\[68\] "No person other than the breeder of a variety registered under this Act or a registered licensee or registered agent thereof shall use the denomination of that variety in the manner as may be prescribed."*

&#x200B;

Politically Pepsico may have been pressurized for today, but this sets a wrong precedent and self-destructive in the long run by dis-incentivizing private investments into research.
Whose patent laws? Yours? The US's? What would US law have anything to do with Native Americans? Hypothetically, Native Americans could have seen fit to declare any creation of theirs as only theirs, without time limits on their ownership. I mean, at the very least, we know they weren't pleased when the colonists ransacked everything they had. Cacao beans were probably another notch among the travesties, to them.

When I say a potato remains a potato, I'm actually alluding to the fact that it's what we know as food. No one should "own" a food source or method. It simply doesn't matter if one potato, or even a banana for instance, is different from another. They're both food and parts of nature, which are inherently accessible to wildlife (including humans). Simply put, if someone wants to grow potatoes or drink water, no one, no corporation, has the right to claim ownership over those food and water sources.

Many people, Native Americans included, had laws. This discussion goes beyond that, into the area of inherent human rights. What the US as a country believes now is really minuscule compared to the history of humanity and time overall. It's truly irrelevant in that sense. I mean, sure, in a real-world sense Pepsico will sue the heck outta poor Indian farmers and force them to join Pepsi's business, but I, for one, don't care about what they can get away with in terms of law. I care about what's actually right for humanity. US law, if it even counts as US law anymore after the takeover by Russia, is not what I'm discussing; my focus is on what I believe to be right or wrong. That is the only law I personally care to obey. Putin doesn't seem like that great a president, idk.
That doesn't mean people won't say no.  Sometimes there are good reasons for that.  It's bad form to start swinging around your dick because people can't give you exactly what you want.  Maybe you can set your sights on a smaller goal instead, or fulfill another goal.  Work with people.
Yet you’re still alive. I call shenanigans!
And now you're not allowed within 1000' of the elementary school.
They were suing in civil court for violating their contract which the farmers breached.
Wow that’s actually a really smart way to handle “patented crops” because patenting stuff like that is horse shit
Yes, that is correct. We may see a change because:

>“After discussions with the Government, the Company has agreed to withdraw cases against farmers. We are relying on the said discussions to find a long term and an amicable resolution of all issues around seed protection,” said a PepsiCo spokesperson on Thursday.
Disney did what?
Are you willing to give every single penny you have... plus go into millions of debt, and give everything to charity?

No? You are a greedy bastard aren’t you?

If things worked the way you wanted... we wouldn’t be able to feed people today... since most plants today... are derived from patents upon patents.

Most of these patents have already expired... so people can work upon them... and improve even further.

If there was no incentive to make news crops... farmers would still be playing the same varieties they were in the 18th century.

People wouldn’t have enough to eat. But you don’t care about people dying from hunger. Since you being in the top 10% of the richest people in the world... wouldn’t be affected. The people who would die would be the poor.

You don’t actually care about poor people... who barely have bought to eat.
All countries should have this absolute right.  Good on India for protecting farmers.
> if that was the case than it would probably just be a breach of contract since they probably had a contract stating that they had to give them all back or destroy them.

Nonetheless... they were still growing PepsiCo patented potatoes without license.

I can't sell copies of Avengers without authorization... Those farmers can't grown that potato without authorization. They knew that.

PepsiCo is 100% innocent and in the right on this one. Sorry... but it's true.

I hate when big corporations do things and get away scott free as much as anyone. I was talking about this today... about the NASA contractor who falsified reports, and sold NASA faulty Aluminium, they cost NASA 750 millions, and got a slap on the wrist and a 50 million fine. That infuriates me.

There's several issues I have with capitalism as well. But just because corporations do shitty things... doesn't mean every time a person is fighting a corporation the person is automatically on the right.

We need to be fair. When PepsiCo does something wrong... let's make them pay. This was not the case. In this lawsuit they were on the right.
I would like to see if the poster has any evidence of this. So far the articles I have seen haven't said that they marketed under any branded name. I'm willing to wait and see if they have this evidence. If not then I would be inclined to agree with you. If so, then we evaluate that and go from there.
Preservation of known seed crops is absolutely essential to avoid famine.  Food is part of the foundations in every society.  The legal statute is in place for very good reasons.

Public opinion turned against PepsiCo and all but guaranteed the farmers would have perpetual legal assistance.  There are many politicians and producers making hay out of this debacle.  I highly doubt opinion could be swayed the other direction even if the families made supporting statements, it's all gone too far.  It is a very bad time for foreign multinationals to be seen attempting to extort local farmers.

We shall see.
Breeding. Lots and lots of breeding.
Pepsi created the GMO; which in this case is a potato. I’m not sure why you think it isn’t a GMO, the second half of your sentence is pretty congruent with the definition of a GMO.
The crazy thing is almost all crops grown by farmers are patented, GMO or not.
I literally said I vaguely remember it... I’m sorry I don’t remember every essay I wrote in school and topics.  I was just trying to just talk about something interesting, way to knock me down a few pegs for no reason. I know you wanna feel empowered on your major but just chill. 

-a dude with a vague recollection of a bullshit essay topic he had no control over and just wanted to fucking graduate and actually go study something of my own interest
That was my senior project final essay. It’s was essentially the class debate/thesis
> Wait until corporations start creating diseases to wipe out the naturally occurring fruits and vegetables so that people are forced to buy their variety.

Literally what anti-vaxxers say: they'll start putting diseases in the vaccines so you have to buy their cure!!

It's a fun sci fi fantasy but it doesn't reflect any real-world possibility. Imagine the litigation after a company knowingly releases a pathogen with the intent of destroying property they don't own...
New variety does not have to be gmo.

You can develop new varieties of plants using other techniques.
They were given the choice to sell their potatoes to the company at the normal price.

I don't think your example demonstrates the intent behind what happened. They saved seed stock, then spent a season growing them. That is a lot of work, this was not an accident, there was an intent to steal, grow, then profit off the theft.

If they were just trying to punish the farmers and not give them a way out I would agree that the damages were crazy... actually... how much can they make from the potatoes (I missed it if it was out there)? The punishment being negation of the gain that was had would be fair... but there was a better option.

Overall it looks like this will cause a change in how the government deals with seeds. So we shall see.
>So these scientists invented potatoes? 

Strawman... that is a strawman.
They invented a specific kind of potato. All other potatoes still exist in the world and you’re welcome to them.
Before I get into the "OMG, that's not inventing" stuff you brought up, I must ask, why did you ignore the entire point of the comment to bring up semantics about one word? The point of the comment was the work that goes into a new creation, not the definition of invent. If you kissed that, now it's pointed out to you. Now, on to what you just said... 

> invent - create or design (something that has not existed before); be the originator of.

So, given that definition, are you saying that the new potatoes that these people created, often from a plan or design that they or others created, is not an invention, and if so, precisely what part of the definition of "invent" is not satisfied simply because the invention is organic?

There's no restriction to invention that says "must be inorganic," so that can't be the reason. Can you stop insulting people long enough to explain why you have a unique definition of invent that the rest of the world doesn't use?

To be honest, from these 4 comments of yours, I'm going to need sources to back up that this isn't how things work as you claim, because what you say doesn't seem to match with the facts.
[deleted]
I mean.... Nearly all of our current produce is selectively bred over hundreds of generations to be better at making edible food.

Just look at Apple varieties or fookin broccoli and all it's bastards.

Besides, man is god because god is an invention of man.
To keep monopolistic corporations afloat buying our country wholesale, good for you maybe.
But not always using the same potato variety.

The FC5 variety was only introduced in 2011, as far as I can find.
It's very clear, the absolute right to retain seed.  Had PepsiCo chosen to farm their own fields exclusively, no potential to retain seed would exist.  PepsiCo attempted to create an exclusive market with artificially low benefits to farmers and is now surprised when farmers assert their seed rights and attempt to create an open market.
You aren't really looking to discuss this, but just want to fight.  Nothing about Native Americans has anything to do with this discussion, so I'll let you rant away about them, and I'll just downvote you and move on.  Have fun!

I didn't realize that patent rights discussion brought out so many intentionally ignorant people that want to show the world that they don't care at all about understanding anything.
They offered to end the lawsuit if the farmers either destroyed the infringed crop or sold the crop to Pepsi.  Basically your call for harmony is let anyone do what they want to the Pepsi IP just because Pepsi is the big guy.
Plot twist: u/kissLarryBirdsbelly is a ghost, doomed to haunt social media.
You should see his portfolio.
INAL. Countries that protect the right to grow whatever you want largely hold contractual claims invalid in face of the law.  Strong laws hold predatory companies, like PepsiCo, from enforcing ridiculous claims.
Exactly man, it's like vegetables- I go to the supermarket and they want money for them- I'm like "how can you charge money- for a *plant*- it *literally* just grows in the ground!" Suckers can't play *me* like that!
Nothing wrong.
It's a trillion dollar company. Again, fuck you.
According to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Plant_Varieties_and_Farmers%27_Rights_Act,_2001) it wouldn't be illegal to grow the potatoes at all.

>Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner.

From that we can clearly see that the law in India would protect them as long as the farmers weren't branding the potatoes. I don't see any clear indication that they were branding and selling the potatoes, and speculation would be this may be why PepsiCo decided to drop the case. If they were branding them, that would be a different story, but they would still have protection if they were growing the potatoes.
PepsiCo was wrong and they knew it when they filed the lawsuits.  You can't breach a contract with unenforceable claims.  The law in India grants an absolute right for farmers to retain seed for future crops.  The law exists to protect farmers from becoming leveraged and dependent on seeds from vendors.  US protections are not enforceable against these farmers, the only protection afforded to PepsiCo is selling under the brand name.

I am a penguin, INAL
Sorry if it wasn't clear. I was totally agreeing with you actually, they had every right to file a lawsuit against them. I was just saying it probably wasn't "stealing" just more of a breach of contract which was probably the angle they were going for.

I also just wanted to point out that there is such thing as a seed potato. Been looking into growing some potatoes in some 5-gallon buckets on my porch.
I did read earlier reports they were selling them to undercover investigators and calling them Lays potatoes.

Is that true? Don't know, but was a more credible outlet.

Do I care to find the source? No, it's early and I don't even care that much.
> A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose [genetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) material has been altered using [genetic engineering techniques](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering_techniques)

Selective breeding has been used for tens of thousands of years and doesn't fall under what is commonly termed "gmo".

Under your definition literally EVERY crop is a GMO as they have been bred by humans towards certain traits.

Pepsi bred the strain of potato, but that doesn't make it a GMO. Might help if you actually understood what GMOs are.
Selectively bred crops aren't patented. Pepsi has a "Plant Variety Protection" on the breed which is more similar to a copyright - the idea being they spent time and money to develop the strain, so they should have the right to do with it what they see fit.

A lot of the "heirloom" strains that people are growing in their gardens have been around for a long time (hence the name), so they aren't protected. But if I invest $10 million making a different variety that's more resistant to damage during shipping, I should have the ability to make my money back from farmers who are now able to sell their crops across the country and earn more than if they were using crops without that resilience.
[deleted]
So if I buy two strands of tomato plants and cross-pollinate them, I should be allowed to patent the new hybrid?
There is no intent to steal when the law specifically guarantees farmers an absolute right to retain seed crop.  India only protects the brand name, not the assertion that a company can own a type of potato.
> If you invented a new wheel, you'd patent it correct? 

No that is. We are talking about inventing a vegetable. Not sure what an inanimate object has to do with creating an organic material.
No, they bred a certain kind of potato until it had certain desirable genetics. I can tell you know nothing of how things grow otherwise you would know that you can’t invent a plant. You can plant a plant and change things along the way until it’s the plant you desire, but saying you invented that plant or thinking that you did makes you look like a twat.
I’m not saying it isn’t reward worthy, but thinking that you own a species of plant is ludicrous.
Bred. Not invented. Can I patent dog breeds? I sure as shit wouldn’t say I invented dogs if you could.
There is the absolute right to retain seed, and to sell the produce as well. But there is no right given to the farmer to sell the produce branded as FC5 potatoes. 

It's clear that the farmers are going to sell these as "FC5 potatoes" and not just randomly as regular potatoes at the mandi, because if they just wanted to sell regular potatoes they need not go to the trouble of finding and planting the restricted FC5 variant.

So will they be able to sell it as FC5? Not legally. Will they be able to sell it under some new name like "Sonalika"? Not legally. 

So what did they plant it for? Of course, to surreptitiously sell it illegally. 

There cannot be an open market for branded or derivative produce, without the breeder's permission, even as per PPVFR Act.
Thanks for the discussion, yoda!
Farmers growing some goddamned potatoes are not a threat to Pepsi.  Knowing corporations, they would offer to buy the crop, but they wouldn't in the end, and no one would hold them accountable.
That’s still shenanigans!
Strong laws don’t stop rich corporations from punitively bankrupting good people with lawsuits. The rich don’t need to win lawsuits to destroy their victims.
What ridiculous claim? When two parties enter an agreement and one party does not uphold that agreement, a lawsuit is neither ridiculous or predatory.
That’s not like this at all you’re an idiot
So what? You think every biotechnology company have billions? Most have less money than you.

What are you proposing? Different laws based on how much a company makes? How much a person makes?

Don’t you realize how dangerous this is? The law must be equal and applied equally to everybody.


But you don’t care about poor people like I said... you sit in your ivory throne... living a life more than 90% of the planet can’t even imagine... not having to worry about food, water, and shelter.

You only care about what would be the best for you... not for the world as a whole. For you sure... biotech companies going out of business wouldn’t affect you. You still would have food and clean water.

For poor people... those are the companies that are creating cheaper more nutritious food. Those are the companies creating cheaper ways to clean water. Those are the companies that are developing vaccines for malaria, dengue, etc.

You don’t care... none of these discoveries would impact you in any way...

You are just a spoiled rich bastard. And yes... you are rich... if you live in the first world... have a car... a roof over you head... and plenty of food... you are already richer than 90% of the world population.
Oh, you don't have to care. It's just odd that you would have the motivation to bother commenting at that point.
I know what it is, I just didn’t realize that the FC5/FL2027 was a selectively bred potato. My mistake.
I'm super humble too, like waaayyyy more humble than you are. [I am as far beyond mutants as they are beyond you](https://youtu.be/OYt78FWfa5M?t=1m10s)
the tone of your first post and the second  are two different tones. And I was pretty damn close, I wasn’t entirely off with my “bad info” either way I’m done have a good whatever
If the resulting cultivar is sufficiently distinct from other known tomato cultivars  (which it won't be if all you did was one step-pollination) - then yes.

The cultivate in question, for example, achieved low moisture content which is atypical for other known potato cultivars.
Maybe not in a case so simple since it's likely already been done or us not sufficiently different to already existing plants, but if you did it with enough different types, yes.  Patents help promote r&d and innovation, without them there would be little incentive to research or design anything.  The problem is how long the patents last.
Think of it this way. If you put in efforts to create a new thing that nobody else has ever seen, then is it not rational that like any other invention, you get credit and proceeds from it?
Legal theft is still theft.
You might as well be saying no one invented a certain kind of alloy or medication because it’s just a bunch of other metals or minerals mixed together.  The problem is that you’ve completely marginalized the time, effort, and technology it takes to arrange those elements in a novel way.
The US founders agreed with you.  The US Congress changed the law for Monsanto and their ilk.
I would venture to say yes.

Just genetically modify one to glow in the dark and require ironclad purchasing contracts that require all offspring to be your company's property.
They could sell it as any generic or new brand term.  Yellow crispys, low water potatoes, giant apple; they are literally allowed to use anything but the protected branding.
We didn't have a discussion.  You just went on about Native Americans, and completely ignored talking about the subject at hand.  You also said a lot of things that don't have any bearing on the real world.
Actually you have to enforce your IP or when something really big happens the other side will cite every instance you ignored IP theft.  Plus they are selling what makes their product taste the way it does.  There are so many things wrong with what these farmers are doing, and the company seems to have bent over backwards to satisfied every bullshit step in your harmony process and you’re still not satisfied.  Of course if the roles were reversed and some big company infringed on the rights of a small time plant breeder you’d call bullshit.
The unearned wealth need the continued acquiesce of the populous.  India First is going to eat PepsiCo.
A lawsuit is predatory when one party includes unenforceable claims in full violation of absolute rights, attempts extortion to enforce their claims, and attempts to abuse a local court system.  PepsiCo is going to lose a lot more than they think on this.
It's the same in that the farmer/supermarket spent money and effort growing, storing and transporting the vegetables, thus they belong to them and they won't give them to you for free.


Pepsi spent money creating a new potato variety which wouldn't exist if it wasn't for their work that they paid for- they own it like the vegetables at the supermarket belong to the supermarket until you *buy* them.
Hopefully greedy scum like you dont exist in the future. You need to be eradicated before too many people think like you, and allow greed to ruin humanity.
Not really. I'm on mobile, procrastinating before going to work.

You can Google it, if you care to find out. 

No one claiming that didn't happen has posted a source, except a possibily biased article from The Hindu.
Unenforceable contracts made by an amoral multinational do not get to define theft.  Fair use of seed crops is guaranteed as means to prevent famine and protect the local populous.  PepsiCo ceded the right to singular use when they chose to use local farmers as means to grow the crops.
You’re comparing literal apples to metals. Ok dude.
When and where did the founding fathers say you couldn’t patent a plant?   The first plant was patented before Monsanto was an agricultural company; not sure how’d they would have anything to do with it.
And would that new potato not be a derivative of FC5?    
If it is a derivative sold commercially, authorization of the breeder is still needed.  


The way I understand, the intent of the law is to enable the farmer to sell it as a generic potato among other potatoes at the mandi. Any other special sale would be a violation, including as a new brand.
In your opinion, that's the case. Not in mine.

I, for one, enjoyed our talk!
They *said* they bent over backwards, of course.  They didn't.  No one made them be mean to a bunch of farmers.  That's bullshit.
I'm greedy? You are a hypocrite. You buy cellphones made by slaves in China and do NOTHING about it. You buy clothes made by children in Vietnam and do NOTHING about it.

As long you are able to keep living your rich privileged life, you don't care about the world.

YOU are the scum.

Wanna do something? Start by stop buying things made from slave labor. But you won't... because they are more expensive... and you rich privilege scum doesn't care about other people. You are filth.
Look bud, you really aren't worth any time or effort. You know what I was asking for but still had to jump in and make claims you refuse to back up. I looked and found no real evidence for the claims they were branded. Let someone else like op provide that or not, and you have yourself a nice day instead of arguing something you clearly have no interest in finding support for.
Uh-huh. And your unwillingness or inability to see the similarities is really neither here nor there; though, in your own words, you’d probably look like less of a twat if you put in a little more effort in understanding the comparison instead of trying to split hairs over widely accepted terminology. There are plenty of rules that a new variety of plant must adhere by before it can be patented, it’s hardly some simple, valueless task that deserves no reward or protection. GMOs, for example, cost an average of $130 million and over a decade of R&D to bring them to market. It would be ridiculous to not offer some sort of protection for that costly innovation.
1790, plants were not allowed.

Plants were first patentable in 1930 in the US.

Monsanto existed from 1901 to 2018 and is famous for GMO's.  Monsanto heavily courted politicians and benefitted from patenting of plants to the detriment of farmers.

Q and their ilk comprises Q and the local group who remind me of Q.
A derivative FC5 sold under the brand.  The farmers can sell it as a Koala, potato, hummingbird, tequila, ad infinitum.

Independent the judiciary, PepsiCo attempted to extort a large sum of money from poor farmers, in full view of the Indian populace, about a type of potato that is now fair game for local suppliers, as a foreign multinational, in a time when India First is the motto and nationalism is at an all time high.  Short an amazing act of contrition, PepsiCo is going to pay a mind bendingly high price at the hands of the populace.
It’s in the article you didn’t read.
Lol what a dumb commercial. Quit trying to be deep, Pepsi. 
Using a vapid twit and an idiot idea to advertise a poisonous, shit product seems appropriate.
I found this ad unintentionally hilarious.  The complete corporate obliviousness of Pepsi coupled with people taking it serious enough to get mad at it was worth it, IMHO.

I cannot believe from the moment someone thought of this through the moment it aired, no one raised a red flag.  Or no one with influence, anyway. 

It is indicative, however, of exactly how powerful people view protest: as a fad/pastime/recreational activity, and just how utterly impotent it is as a tool for change.

"We want something Contemporary, Sol.  Something 'now,' something that will resonate with the kids.  Something like Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson for the late 2010s.  What are the kids into these days, Sol?"

"Protesting.  They love protesting.  And Kendall Jenner.  We need to get something together with Kendall Jenner and protesting, and Pepsi."
the add offended me b/c they kept on showing a kid playing the cello. but all you heard was some shitty song. if your going to show someone playing the instrument through out the commercial. then let us hear him play.
Who the hell is a Kendell Jenner? 
Didn't she kill a dude? 
They pulled the ad and are in the process of apologizing to everybody they may have 'offended'. 
If I saw this commercial I wouldn't even know who Kendall Jenner was.  Assuming I even watch commercials (which I don't).
It was a stupid, tone-deaf commercial that manage to piss off both sides of the political spectrum. 

That's not easy to do. 
Isn't it funny how they pulled all their ad funding from that racist website YouTube. Yet still use YouTube as a platform to launch their ad 
The latest celebrity of the Kardashian Klan trying to make a public image for herself? FIRE THE PITCHFORKS -- We must nip it in the bud. For Science
Pandering in advertisements is supposed to be subtle enough that the group you are trying to pander to doesn't even know you are pandering to them. This ad had the subtlety of an M1 abrams battle tank.
Conservatives bitch if someone takes a knee during the anthem and liberal snowflakes get triggered by a stupid Pepsi commercial. Political correctness and outrage culture is becoming more and more pervasive unfortunately 
I don't really get it. Why are people upset?
Pepsi knew what they were doing. They wanted controversy and publicity. They are not naive. This was planned to spark controversy and get attention for their product. It worked. 
Serious question: what **isn't** racist?
Jesus, people in this country are the biggest pussies in the world sometimes. We always gotta look for something to bitch and moan about. 
Possibly the worst person you could have used for that ad. Or any ad, really; the demo that likes her is *way* smaller than the demo that hates her (kind of irrationally in my opinion; it's not like she's really done anything wrong other than grow up with money and fame but that's on her family and not her but I'm getting off topic) and that doesn't make for good advertising.
... I just want to make sure we're still cool with the show, right? 

Pewdiepie did a great video on it
That's how I saw it. Insignificant. If you like Pepsi you're going to continue to drink it. If you don't like Pepsi, maybe you'll use this as a talking point, but it's progbbaly fake outrage anyway.
That's why people got mad.  This ad makes protesting not cool.  It makes it corporate and bullshit.  If a corporation like Pepsi stands behind your protest, how cool is your protest?  

It's like your Mom coming to all your punk shows and standing in the front row taking pictures.  Like, Ma, thanks, but we're trying to destroy the system here.
"I think you're on to something, Mel. We show them Pepsi is the brand socially aware people buy. And what if this starts a craze? People mimickimg the ad and handing police officers a Pepsi during the next protest, bet you those skittish officers wont be as quick to bust out the tear gas when they are enjoying a refreshing beverage!"
I think Pepsi knew exactly what they were doing from the get go. They wanted some controversy and publicity. 
You seriously think they didn't think this would happen? It's obvious. The commercial is just naive enough to throw off suspicion of being purposefully controversial, while still being stupid enough for people to talk about how stupid it is.

Guess what dude, *it worked*. No press is bad press, and people are saying Pepsi ^tm all over the internet now.

>I cannot believe from the moment someone thought of this through the moment it aired, no one raised a red flag. Or no one with influence, anyway.

This is exactly what happened. I bet you a lot of the younger/junior creatives would have felt it was wrong, but were either hesitant to voice their opinions to the senior teams or were plain silenced. This is unfortunately very common in advertising - a lot of out-of-touch people think they're on the right path.

Why did they pull ad funding?
Boredom is taking hold.  We've had all entertainment and knowledge at our fingertips for long enough that we are now bored, and we want blood.  It's simply a boredom killing exercise to destroy someone's life as part of an online lynch mob.
I completely agree that political correctness is a joke. However, Insinuating that Taking a knee during the anthem is a form political correctness is wrong.
Well the cops are patrolling a protest, presumably about a cause the angry people support. And then here comes privileged, rich Kylie Jenner making friends with the cops when she's not even a supporter of the cause the protesters. It's a stupid ad and an even stupider thing to get upset about 
The right is mocking it for being stupid. The left is offended, probably for something like "marginalizes the struggles of women of color" or something else ridiculous like that.
I'm just laughing my ass off now since they pulled there ads off YouTube. It's an incredibly dumb marketing move. The youth watches YouTube today more than any TV channel. And then they do this to try to win the youth back. It's kinda sad 
Black people + liberals + satirical humor = OMG LITERALLY HITLURRR.
I'll let Anita Sarkeesian answer that question.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsgFXZAMCrM
So... every ad ever then.
I feel like much of left wing politics already isn't "cool" because it's already so mainstream. it didn't garner as much attention or ridicule as this but there was a Coca Cola commercial that was literally "diversity is good". When you have "diversity sponsored by Coca-Cola" it's a tough sell for teens that want to rebel. 

And the same is true for much of left wing politics nowadays - LGBT rights or feminism are so mainstream that it's cool to rebel against them in particular on the internet where the zeitgeist is generally not on the left wing side.
"Officer, I'm going to reach under my car seat and grab you a Pepsi"

Officer holsters gun excited for his refreshing beverage.

That was the second commmercial that hadn't aired yet.

"Yes, we believe the riot officer was injured by a flying glass Pepsi bottle." 
Ordinarily I'd agree with you and I understand what you mean that for some things "all publicity is good publicity."

I do not think this is true for Pepsi, a product with universal brand name recognition.  I do not think this helps to sell Pepsi.  In a "boycott this / fuck that thing" world, I think this can only be a loss.

I just posted the same thing before I read your post. Of course Pepsi did this for the publicity. They wanted the controversy.  
Something about YouTube being a platform for racism and extremism
Basically a bunch of news sites have been trying to get advertisers to drop YouTube with a bunch of bs articles.

Pepsi is really stupid for pulling there ads. YouTube gets more views then most TV stations put together. 
Believe it's a reference to the football player that took a knee instead of standing fir the anthem. 
Leftist here: not offended. Just a stupid ad.
Guess I better paint my legos with pink nail polish
I don't think this is the case at all. 

This ad misses, not because it makes protesting not "cool". It misses because it trivializes the pain and effort people go through to protest social justice. 
There is a point to this. I've considered this since I first thought about the subject. I reached the conclusion that Pepsi could not be so naive as to make the commercial about a cipontroversial issue without being aware of the negative consequences. 
Couldn't any online resource be a platform for racism and extremism these days though? I was just curious about why they would pull ad funding from YouTube specifically.  
Ah. Thanks for the info. Yeah it's pretty stupid in this day and age to pull your ads from YouTube. I know more people that use YouTube than have cable these days, and that's in a wide range of ages. 
You're right. I shouldn't really say 'leftists', so much as "overly sensitive progressives". They're the one's *upset*. The rest of us think it's incredibly stupid and maybe got a kick out of making fun of it. 
lol dumb leftist desperate to be the plucky underdog in denial about how utterly establishment their entire ideology is. Every organ of power in the Western world is in lock step with your way of thinking, your rebel without a clue days are over.
It probably would be get more attention that way
"I actually ordered a Coke..."
Actually, if this becomes a trend.... Pepsi's viral marketing campaign is a success.

And that is how you get tackled and tazed.
"Won't you gentlemen have a pepsi"
Yeah, I was thinking in the shower this morning... it could've all been a publicity stunt. 
It's already a success, the amount of free publicity they have received is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The name Pepsi has been Trending for a few days, they have been on every news cast too. 
until someone tries it and gets blown away. then its a lawsuit. not saying it should be a lawsuit but it would be. 
I'm not crazy, you're the one who's crazy.
It was held at the crotch so room temperature.
This controversy will probably drive pepsi sales up more then that commercial would have
They just love all the "Cloak and Dagger" stuff.

They say they're going fix my brain
Why is this news? In many schools it is against the rules to sell things that are not authorized. In my high school I had a soda dealer who had to hide his dealings from the staff. If he got caught he would be suspended, but I don't know if that's newsworthy.
Well, it's only a matter of time before kids turn to the harder stuff.  Mountain Dew, Surge...where will it end?
When i was 10 our cafeteria had an "extras" table where kids could go to buy basically junk foods cookies, candies, nachos, cheesestix and sodas. One of the candies they had were individual warheads. 50cents USD each or 2 for 75cents. Well at the time i used to go with my grandmother regularly to Sam's Club where one day i discovered a 25bag box of warheads for $12 bucks with each bag containing 10 warheads. I quickly did some head math and figured i could double my spendings if i sold everyone for 25cents each. So i got the warheads and went to work the following monday out of my lunchbox office. After selling the first four warheads i had enough money to buy my first soda and was so excited. Well the elementary school was trying to make a buck anyway they could so instead of only having the option of buying a soda for a dollar, you could drop a quarter in a shot glass in the bottom of a 5gal bucket full of water and win a coke. I took the bait, and lost a quarter and my chance for my coke. I went home after school and jammed my office full of warheads determined to get that coke that had been teasing me all year long. At lunch the next day i sold all my warheads before half of lunch was over and went to my 5 gallon nemesis and proceeded to attack every spot the top of the water had to offer to no avail. I had lost all my quarters but 4 and was debating on what to do with them so i decided to double down, which was the best decision of my life. I centered my last shot directly above the shot glass one quarter on top of the other and let loose my double metal barrage and BAM science happened. Much like when you drop a piece of paper and it is all over the place but if you put a book underneath it, it will fall straight down. The same thing happened with the quarters and i had two cokes worth two dollars that i paid 50cents for. Needless to say after that business was booming, i was living the life of riley, slingin warheads and scammin the system of cokes. Everyone wanted to sit by me at lunch or hang out with me at recess. I paid my grams off every friday to pick me up more product and the cycle continued. Until one day my arch enemy Shaun Sheffield (hope youre reading this ya little douche) told Ms. Sandlin of my little operation successfully shutting me down. i laid low for a couple weeks and then thought i could start her back up. Not the case, the lunch monitors were on to my game and i was threatened with having to eat on stage if i tried it again. I thought well at least i have my little coin game with the sodas which to my dismay got branded with "ONLY ONE COIN AT A TIME". After that things went back to normal and i was just one of the crowd...

TL;DR: Started hustling candies and cola at lunch and got shut down by the dementors of the lunch room.

Full-sugar soda is likely healthier.  [Research article posted elsewhere recently.](http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/put-artificially-sweetened-soda-pop-coke-weight-gain-diet-health-90165/#.VAnjJnyBIeY.reddit)

"A body that believes it is getting an energy boost (as the sweet taste of the soda implies) and then does not may react by going into WTF mode (Where’s the Fructose?). This translates to cravings for the next high-calorie option that crosses our path."

During 8th grade I sold out of my locker Bubble-yum and Hubble-bubble gum (back then it was 25 cents for a pack of five and I sold it at a dime a piece) and Jolly Ranchers sticks or a box of Lemonheads for a quarter (which cost me a dime).

 By the end of the week I would have $10.00 to spend at the arcade. Good times till the local gang (Paco 13) wanted their ten bucks a week for doing business on their turf. Plus it didn't help, I, a white boy, was "going out" with a vato's sister.

We wouldn't want children thinking that capitalism is anything other than pure evil, would we?
i dont see the problem here... lets teach kids that making money by using your brain is wrong.  Its wrong when the schools limited the choices kids have or over charge... when I was in school I sold soda at lunch all the time $1.25 a bottle and the school was selling the same soda for $1.75. my friends would pay $1. the thing is nothing in the school code prevented it and when the school board had a meeting to discuss kids selling things on the property my mom came and kicked some butt... I can honestly say my first year of college was paid for with soda money from school events as well as my first car. $1,000 beater but  telling kids they cant earn money is a shame. ( i also sold out of my car at the sports events)  on a good night you could walk out with $300 easy

I go to the same school as this guy, most of his money was from people who would rather not ingest aspartame, which all the pop that the school sells contains.  In my opinion it was unfair for him to be suspended, especially when the school often encourages entrepreneurship.  
Why only diet soda? If it's sweetened with aspartame as they usually are, that's far worse for them than sugar or even HF corn syrup.
I'm not a big fan of soda for anyone on a regular basis and could understand an overall ban of soda but this?
Where the fuck is this?

This is like that one episode of "That's So Raven"
/r/firstworldanarchists
I drank a mexican full sugar cola last week & it was great, less chem taste & more caffeine.  Diet soda tries to fool the taste/stomach sensors into believing you are imbibing food, but the brain knows the difference and compensates by increasing food demand.  Why are our educators so stupid?
I knew this cool black dude who was always high and made a killing buying those $5 bags of random candy, and selling each piece at school for $1. He would always have like $30 of candy in his backpack, which could be sold for like $200
Yeah, I still know my high school soda pimp. He'd actually come in to lunch with a black trenchcoat with Jones Soda bottles in the pockets along the inside. He'd trade you a soda for a dollar or two for a cheesey dipper (cheese covered breadstick and marinara sauce). 

Oh, and the trenchcoat wasn't normal. He just wore it at lunch. Pretty sure the staff knew, but thought it was too hilarious to stop. 
Yep. I was the candy dealer in my middle school. I'd go to sams club with my parents and spent my entire allowance on candy on Friday (The multi packs of gum, full sized candy bars, anything I could get for less than $0.75 per piece in bulk). I would take that to school on Monday and most of the time double/triple my allowance. I bought a ton of video games from that illicit trade until 7th grade when the school wised up to all the gum on everything. I had In school suspension for 2-3 days, and with that my middle school killed a young entrepreneurs dream to own every N64 game. 
They banned candy at my middle school (this was nearly 20 years ago).  I went to the Dollar Store and bought them in bulk (or you know, 2 dozen at a time).  4 for 1$ at the dollar store.

Then I would bring them to school and sell them for 1$ each.  A complete rip off at the time, but kids would pay it.  I made over 100$ in profit before the school caught me.  5 days of in-school suspension. 

My parents weren't even mad. 
Do schools not have Coke machines in them anymore? My High Schools cafeteria even had fountain Pepsi machines in the lunch lines.
I think a warning would be a much more rational first step.
I used to do this with candy of all sorts in junior high school.  I had to be careful as hell not to get busted.
There was a girl at my school who sold Mexican dulces out of her backpack. She made bank. 
It's "news" because it's reason.com a typical libertarian blog spam filled with angry Republicans oops I'm sorry, "libertarians"

Every time redditors submit links to conservative blogspam sites, God kills a kitten. Think of the kittens. 
I think the better reason is why are schools and officials punishing kids who are taking the inititive and trying to earn extra money by selling a legal substance. I can see drugs a little. They could be abused I get that. I still don't understand why girls aren't allowed to carry midol in their bags. Food and drinks not so much. Why is it wrong for a student not in a club or group to sell junk food to other students. 
Suspension is an overreaction - just tell him to stop it and quit acting like it's a crime or something.

Hey, dude.  I want to introduce you to a concept called paragraphs.  Paragraphs are these awesome things that break up long posts to more manageable chunks.

See, when humans look at 2600 character and 24 line paragraphs such as yours, their brain freezes up and it triggers a neurological response to totally ignore the post.  Overall, humans don't like long paragraphs, but they don't mind a long post split up into paragraphs.

Paragraphs are simple.  When you sense that the topic of the paragraph is shifting, like when you're talking about a new time of day or a new concept, you just hit Enter twice.

That's it.  You've now made a paragraph.  There are a few other advanced rules around it, such as the single sentence "Holy fucking shit... this is important" paragraph.  But, really, just making paragraphs where you can is the most important step.

TL;DR: Making TL;DRs is no excuse for not breaking up your paragraph.
To speculate: because it sounds good in PTA meetings and on the school board that they are "banning sugary drinks"
I actually get horrible head aches from diet soda.
have some evidence? Everytime someone claims that I see it proven wrong
How the hell is this upvoted, this has long been debunked.
Pure refined sugar isn't really all that natural. Sure it comes from plants, but is a relatively new introduction in the human diet historically.  The human body has evolved to deal with sugar from fruit and similar sources not pure sugar in large quantities quickly. 
That's not healthier, it can just lead to someone binging, but if they have self control it's absolutely better to drink a non calor non sugary soda instead of one full of both
It's against State law in CA. The schools have no discretion, like weapons. 

Bake sales are banned. So are candy sales for band. 

This; and I can't tell a student they are required to bring paper or pencil.

From another news article that didn't add an extreme bias into the story

> "...but yes, he did get his warning,” Shaw-Letourneau, a former school teacher.

.

>Mom says her son admittedly ignored a principal’s warning to stop selling pop from his locker...
Is that like a chicklet?  
Strictly speaking, it may not be legal to sell it. If items aren't properly labeled for individual resale then shit can hit the fan if something like an allergic reaction happens. There are lots of other potential problems. The manufacturer may feel cut out of profits due to a product not meant for resale being sold at a markup. The school also has a responsibility to protect the students from being gouged due to the artificially inflated demand because attendance laws create a captive market. And on, and on.
Well, that policy mainly applies in schools that stopped providing junk food to students because it's harmful. So, understandably they're not going to endorse the sale of food and drink that only does harm.
>*. . . why are schools and officials punishing kids who are taking the inititive and trying to earn extra money by selling a legal substance.*

Because the substance has been banned from schools by members of the community - the voting parents of the students. That effectively makes the substance 'illegal' in this situation. The punishment has also been agreed to by members of the community.

>*I can see drugs a little.*

Really? You can only see banning drug sales in schools *a little*?

But that's an allergy, it's not something that's going to be a problem for everyone. (PS: Just drink water, you fatties.)
It's the aspartame, it sort of numbs satiety so you never really feel full. This can lead to binging if you're fat fuck and can't control your diet.

While I don't disagree with what you are saying, your assumption of high school kids having self-control is laughable.

No but Michelle's ridiculously absurd lunch mandates are driving our kids to starvation. Her war on lunches is a failure. 
No, mercola is not a credible source 
Peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have found aspartame is safe for consumption at current levels.

http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/1641.htm


I don't know much about mercola but you won't find scholarly and scientific articles that say "hidden dangers" or refer to a chemical as a "poison". The sources are also limited and reference emails or another source rather than a real study. 
Aspartame is one of the MOST researched food additives on the market.  Google it sometime with an open mind.
So candy sales are gateway to the hard time?  Is that why they're so keen to get candy away from kids?

Dude into remember the trench coat mafia days. I can't believe how weird people were in the 90's.
Minus some chemicals and plus some vitamins, so overall healthier. 
Okay, it's because the school doesn't want anyone horning in on their action. They don't want any competition selling junkfood to the students.

Is house arrest really "hard time"?
Nah. Last name E, first name Eazy.
no, this was a bit after columbine, I'm sure some of them were doing it as copycats
Yes, of course.  Because elected officials always act in the interests of the voters and do what they want.  And because voters take an interest in their local school board when election season comes around.

Also, this is Canada, I wouldn't presume to speak for how their school boards work.
Or we can just grow up, treat everyone like people instead of dumb animals, and I can go tell any community/board/whatever that tries to regulate what I can put into my own body to kindly fuck off and die.

Stalinist communism is window- dressing. Communism is great propaganda, but Stalin was more of a Socialist Dictator. Same with China - although I'd call them more Fascist today. They embrace capitalism, the health of state over the individual, and they have state sponsored guerrilla e-fighters. 
I graduated just before Columbine happened and I hung out with the leather and trench wearing burnouts.  I heard that after Columbine our already draconian principal made wearing a trenchcoat in school a three day suspension.
I'm not sure why this just showed up in my InBox today, stamped 7 days ago. Oh well.

I did not notice that the incident occurred in Canada. Good catch, and I will join you in not presuming to speak regarding that school system administration.

I'm quite certain you don't believe there is *any* elected body *anywhere* that *always* acts in the interests of *all* the voters. Surely you understand how representative government works.

>*and I can go tell any community/board/whatever that tries to regulate what I can put into my own body to kindly fuck off and die.*

You can do this also. In fact, it is common practice for these boards to set aside some time during every meeting just for this purpose. It usually appears on the agenda as 'Public Comments' or something similar. Give it a shot and report back!

Pepsi brand lobster is the best lobster to have at your local red lobster. Make sure to get in on the all you can eat Pepsi brand shrimp!
How much shit was blown into the ocean from the hurricane season?  It’s not necessarily people littering.
Indeed. If someone isn't worried about it by now then I'm worried about them.
She probably has that same tattoo. 
Kidney suicide
Or they're having a very good day... the lobster demographic numbers just came in, and they're really, really good.
Yes it is. 
Fairly certain you can depict the police in film. We're not North Korea, yet.
and now, once again... even more exposure for both the company and the model. 
Who the fuck seriously cares about a Pepsi commerical? So ridiculous.
I'd say that overall, Pepsi is going to come out on top. Their getting tons of exposure and meme treatment and their mess up didn't really create a negative view of the product.
I hate the Independent! The formating sucks. Why is the video always covering half my screen? 
They were more upset that the police in the ad didn't look like terror nazi paramilitary ninja assault forces.
 You can.  However you can't use copyrighted logos without permission, which they did.

For those who weren't aware, they logos they used were that of the San Francisco Police Department. 
Couldn't Pepsi simply just [buy the world a coke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VM2eLhvsSM) and call it a day?
I agree. While the ad was tacky and in bad taste, it is easy to see the good message they were trying to send, and they were very quick to back off and apologize. Between those two factors, this is actually making them look pretty good.
IF by on top, you mean a drop is stock value, then yes.
Yes alot of people were upset Kendall wasn't shot .
>*you can't use copyrighted logos without permission, which they did.*

Interesting. The SFPD disagrees with you in the article:

* "It's not 100 percent identical but it appears to be our patch," SFPD spokesperson Officer Robert Rueca told ABC13."

Nothing will come of this 'claim', because nothing *should* come of it.
I'd like to see some laws on that. Because I've never seen where you have to blur logos if you don't get a company to sign off on it. I can't imagine one burger joint asks permission to show their competitor in a commercial and they are like, sure go ahead.
No, it doesn't make them "look good".

What it does, is plaster their name all over the internet, and make people talk about them. Which is the goal of advertising.
idk about all of that...when the idea was pitched anyone with a 4th grade education would be like hmmmmm doesnt anyone think this will be offensive?i fail to see any good message...looked more like a chess move
Really, because the SFPD has said other wise

> Sources at the San Francisco PD tell us Pepsi never asked permission to mimic their uniforms. What's more, the sources say they're working with the City Attorney to determine if producers crossed the legal line by using the logo, which the City considers proprietary.

>*anyone with a 4th grade education . . .*

That claim reflects the reasoning ability of someone with a 4th grade education.

Youre right it seemed like a giant mess.and I still I don't get what they were trying to say about trans people ? People who don't see the problem with the ad are just as tone-deaf . 
Actually, the majority of people are too busy trying to keep their shit together to care whether or not a commercial offended some college kids with no sense of how the real world works.
I quoted the source designated by SFPD. Your 'source' is another step removed, and not named.

You can go with TMZ as your preferred source, I'll stick with the designated, named, and directly quoted SFPD spokesperson.

Besides, the source you provided *still* doesn't claim that the official SFPD patch was used. Hell, the commercial was filmed in Thailand. No reason for SFPD cops to be there.

Maybe the patches and uniforms were created by local Thai talent from an amalgam of ideas.
> I quoted the source designated by SFPD. Your 'source' is another step removed, and not named.

Except your source said the exact same thing a day or two later than "my" source.  I mean you should include the full quote next time.  However since you didn't here is the rest of it.."After our understanding that this occurred, we are investigating the matter."

Man it's almost like that says exactly what my quote said.

> You can go with TMZ as your preferred source, I'll stick with the designated, named, and directly quoted SFPD spokesperson.

I went with TMZ because they were first.  They also had a picture of both emblems, something yours does not.  However if you would have taken the time to look at the photo you would see that the only reason they are 100% accurate is because they are different colors.

Just because you recolor something doesn't give you the right to use it.

> Besides, the source you provided still doesn't claim that the official SFPD patch was used.

That's not the issue here.  The issue is they used an exact replica and just recolored it.

> Hell, the commercial was filmed in Thailand. No reason for SFPD cops to be there.

Irrelevant to the matter at hand.

> Maybe the patches and uniforms were created by local Thai talent from an amalgam of ideas.

So the local patch, was created by local Thai talent to say "San Francisco Police."  They some how managed to have everything about the real SFPD logo on theirs.  I mean wow, that's just amazing. 

Next time, at least look at things before you comment.  Because god damn do you look dumb now.
>*I went with TMZ because they were first.*

I went with the SFPD spokesperson because they were more current, officially designated, identified, and quoted directly as a source in the posted article. Your source is inferior by every comparison.

>*They also had a picture of both emblems, something yours does not.*

Actually, mine does. My source is the original article submitted to create this thread. Obviously you never read the article or you would know this. You have now exposed yourself as a 'title-only' reddit reactionary. Congratulations.

>*However if you would have taken the time to look at the photo you would see that the only reason they are 100% accurate is because they are different colors.*

Well, aside from the different letters, and the different images, yes, the different colors are the only difference.

Trust the SFPD to prove you wrong. They've already indicated they will take action if they can identify infringement. So far none of their fine investigators have come to that conclusion.

Expect them to chase the 'maybe' for a bit, and then do nothing. Because there is nothing to do. Because there is nothing wrong.

Then expect me to revisit you and rub your nose in all this BS you're laying down. Until then, you should buy a towel. Or some baby wipes. You're gonna need them.


> Well, aside from the different letters, and the different images, yes, the different colors are the only difference.

Different letters...those look like the same letters to me.

Different images...Two tone eagle with the wings spread with the head facing the same way.  The tone of the eagle changes at exactly the same point.  The eagle is sitting on a two tone item that both are split at exactly the same part.  Then under that there are three dashes, which both have.  Then under that you have 3 ribbons that both have words on them (note: the quality is poor so you can't read both of them.) 

So the fact you see "different images shows your bias."

I read "Official LSD Announcement:" and whole thing still made sense.
God may be busy, but HE still has time to endorse his favorite refreshing beverages.
Their *health code* allows Coke and Pepsi, but not coffee and tea?  You're doing it so very wrong!
> Part of the confusion stems from LDS church-owned Brigham Young University, which neither sells nor serves caffeinated drinks. But BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins explains that is “not a university or church decision, but made by dining services, based on what our customers want.”

> There has not “been a demand for it,” Jenkins said Thursday. “We are constantly evaluating what those needs and desires are.”

This is an outright, unadulterated lie.  Ten commandments, Carri Jenkins.

BYU has banned the sale of caffeinated drinks for many, many decades and has consistently refused to explain why.  There is a huge demand for Coke and Pepsi on campus, so much so that are a number of 7-Eleven like shops just off of campus which do brisk business in students and faculty alike buying contraband Coke and Pepsi to bring onto the BYU grounds (traditionally in huge Big Gulp like mugs).

BYU doesn't sell caffeinated drinks because of ultraconservative misinterpretation of Mormon doctrine among its university administration, full stop.

Just another gesture that goes to show it's all a bunch of BS
This is somewhat less amazing than when the Pope abolished Limbo.

Hey, gotta get those endorsements for Romney somehow. There's some big political money coming from those two companies.
They discovered that the proper mixture of coke and pepsi will create a fuel that has the ability to send one to Kolob.
I read through the article and thought good job Onion... then I glanced at the URL...
Its gotta suck when a religion prevents you from enjoying the good things in life.


>the faith’s health-code reference to “hot drinks” ‘’does not go beyond (tea and coffee).”

Does that include ice tea?
Coke and Pepsi only, no shasta, god has spoken
Congrats Mormons! Enjoy your cavities and diabetes! 
How about Red Bull or Monster? Iced Tea? Iced Coffee?
I thought this was the onion until I clicked on the link.
Silly religions are silly.  More at 10......
But have you ever seen a Romney on caffeine?!! 
Just a quick quiz. Everyone here making fun of Mormonism because of Romney does realize the Majority Leader of the Senate, Democrat Harry Reid, is a Mormon right?
I was raised LDS, and this is how most members interpreted the Word of Wisdom (Mormon health code) already. I guess it's just official now. 
[deleted]
I take it Mitt Romney is a Mountain Dew man and they do not want any controversy when "The White Horse" has photos leaked of him drinking a "Hitler Did nothing Wrong"? 
I don't care what they drink, they're still fucking nuts.
Maybe they did a little too much "LDS" back in the 60's.
PAARRTYYY TIME!
What about Mountain Dew?
Coke and Pepsi still not OK for human consumption, however. Great for cleaning toilets and engines!
Teeth rotting, chemical filled sugary diabetes water is okay.  Natural, from the earth beverages?  No way man..  
But not Tab, that shit sucks.
Romney was seen drinking a diet coke and the church must respond to protect
Sounds like the big corporate masters got to them.
Why is this in r/news? 
This makes no sense. My mind, it can't take any more. And this is the religion Romney practices?
I grew up and it was always: We can't drink tea and coffee because of the some acid in them that is used for tanning leathers. Caffeine was bad because it was addictive. And alcohol was well alcohol. What a load of shit this is. Glad I moved on, but perhaps I can finally get my mormon friends to taste have the wonder that is Dr. Pepper!
I wonder how much the corporations donated to the cause.
God bless lobbyists.
HOW IS THIS NEWS?!?!?!?!
>  They just don’t bar members from, say, pounding a Pepsi, downing a Mountain Dew **or sipping a hot chocolate.**

I am very certain that hot chocolate is a hot beverage.

How about iced tea or iced coffees?


http://www.reddit.com/r/teaporn

Go ahead and click, Latter Day Saints. You know you want to.
Well, that's good to know for people unable to think for themselves.
But you would have gone straight to hell if you drank Coke before the announcement went out.
Obviously Coke and Pepsi have deeper pockets for lobbyists than tea and coffee do.


So, *so* stupid.
Bwahahaha ! i have snapped up the exclusive rights to Market JOLT! cola in the state of Utah! 
Didn't this change when the church bought a huge steak in Pepsi?
Only Kolob-Cola
hooray for slippery slopes! maybe light beer will be next...
Yet another reason why Mormons are idiots.
In a related story, the LDS last week buys millions worth of Coke and Pepsi stock and Romney wanted crucial funding from those companies

/sarcasm, I think.
Coke and Pepsi are not OK for Coffee and Tea?????
Cheersing every 80 year old Mormon drinking their first hot chocolate. 
This just goes to show that even were Mormonism true, they've lost their way.  You don't just get to cancel and reinterpret direct revelation from god, yet they've given into social pressure for polygamy, priesthood among black members, and now they're changing their traditional stance of avoiding drugs in general to allowing the caffeine-based drinks they have ownership in?  Coffee and tea are less bad for you than all the sugar and carbonation in soda, a modern day Word of Wisdom would have told them all to avoid junk food and sugars; it's a given that you can go ahead and eat and drink whatever the fuck you want regardless of how good for you it is or not.
Ahahahahha, you plebs and your stupid religious food rules!
The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve must have just purchased a few shares of [KO](https://www.google.com/finance?q=KO) and [PEP](https://www.google.com/finance?q=PEP).

Mittens knows how to run a business not because of his work at Bain Capital; he learned all he needed from the LDS church.
LDS = loons dumbasses and sucktards.
I really, really hope that Romney will have his first Coke on TV, and that it will then go like that episode of Spongebob where Squidward has his first Krabby Patty.
Thy holy tasty bev.
Maybe they are hoping either will make a donation to Mitt
 funny morons
The LDS Church is timing this because they expect their boy Romney will bump up attendance. 
[deleted]
Heath and religion should *never* mix. That being said, if you're stupid enough to trust your religion for health advice, you deserve what's coming to you.
I wonder how much money they got to announce that.
This is okay, so long as they stay firm on the blacks and gays not having souls thing.
I totally read it that way and was like, "yep."
Makes more sense as an LSD announcement.
I mean, the Book of Mormon doesn't say anything about not drinking caffeine, it has a [prohibition on "hot drinks"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_Wisdom#Hot_drinks) which has historically been interpreted to be a ban on caffeine, but it doesn't have to be. If anything this is a sign of progress in Church of LDS.

I'm not trying to defend stupid religious ideals, but I do think its dumb to single out Mormonism over other religions, they are all equally ridiculous. 
God may be busy, but HE still has time to make sure his fat ass followers get their sugar & Romney gets his money from Coke/Pepsi.
No hot drinks.

Why, you say? Shut the fuck up, that's why.

Hmm?...I can't do that to myself, Mr. President!
It's not the only thing that they're doing so very wrong.
Is this the way they do it on planet Kolob ? Yes, Mormons have their very own planet.
Because scripture.
I thought caffeine was off limits? Anyway, I think it's dumb. Mormonism is dumb. I'm sorry but it just is.
They changed this a while back actually, I didn't know it was new news. They changed it when the head of Coke or Pepsi (I can't recall) joined the LDS
Just one clarification: caffeinated beverages aren't contraband on BYU campus. Apart from that, as a BYU student, I agree that a misinterpretation of doctrine is very likely the reason there's no caffeine sold on campus.
I think they're concerned about their image with all this press on Romney.  It's kind of like when they decided in 1978 that black people were OK.
[deleted]
I'm not sure how you draw this conclusion. Caffeine was never forbidden for Mormons. This is simply a clarification, particularly after the NBC special the other week.
Snorting Tobacco is A-OK.  
That's the way that it has always been. I have no idea how the media is always finding the individuals who think Coke is against Mormon beliefs.
Bolok(s)!
I expect to see this in /r/nottheonion soon...
Like getting my fuck on.
"... and the Lord did look upon his people and said '*Thou shalt drink thy Coke and Pepsi but none of that generic shit for it doth taste like ass, Amen.*'"
We already could? As a Mormon, there's nothing new here in this article. It's really more of a clarification due to common misconceptions.
Sounds like someone got paid off by Coke and Pepsi. 
 None of those have endorsement deals set up so no.
Most iced tea and  coffee is made hot first, so you can probably count those out.
[Checks list of large Romney campaign donors twice]

"No! No way!"

[Snopes begs to differ](http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/mormon.asp)
I had a vision.. god says it's ok to drink Pepsi now..!
It's always been this way. This announcement isn't a change of doctrine. It's a public clarification of how it has been for many years. 
I know right? If anything it should be the opposite. Coffee is GOOD for you, while Soda is the worst thing for your health to drink. 
That would be a hot drink.

The passage that forbids coffee and tea is here https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng

It is hot drinks that are forbidden not caffeine.
Now I am imagining Obama making that face Spongebob makes when he finds out that Squidward likes Krabby Patty's.
>several religions and most cults

But you repeat yourself.
So ... some dude was tripping and suddenly realized "coke and pepsi are okay for mormons!"

Sounds about right.
It is dumb, but given how conservative Mormonism is, it isn't surprising.

What year did a pope unban caffeine again? It was banned with entheogens for hundreds of years until a pope liked drinking coffee and decided to unban it.

edit: Just looked it up (thanks wikipedia) and coffee was unbanned in the 1600s. The first coffee shop opened in 1645. Mormonism was created in the 1820s. This gives over 100 years for coffee to be accepted so I guess my original comment isn't entirely valid.
The book of Mormon mentions no prohibition of any drug or drink. It is in the doctrine and covenants 
I don't understand. 

Why would hot cocoa be virtuous, and coffee be sinful?

If caffeine isn't an issue, then what *is* the issue? 

"We have decided that the term 'hot drinks' refers to coffee and tea and nothing else."

Man, I could've sworn that "hot drinks" referred to drinks that were hot. 
must be because warm cola tastes bad
What about hot soup?

What if you put hot soup in a cup and drank it?
You're right, they're not contraband and haven't been for at least 30 years.  I was being flowery in my speech.
...decided in 1978 that black people were *people.*

[deleted]
Well they just made it worse by calling public attention to their weirdness.

I'm sure they don't see it as the least bit weird though.
The same way they find individuals that think Obama isn't an American.
Probably because folks are trying to make sense of the hot drink, coffee/tea thing deducing caffeine as the commonality.  
It does make me wonder what qualifies as 'hot drink'.  What about iced coffee or tea?  Does this mean warm milk before bed is out?  Makes me chuckle
At least now it's officially clarified, and no one will need to speculate on exactly how stupid these people are in regards to beverages.
My parents are some. I was raised LDS and was told that the prohibition was talking about caffeinated drinks. Both my mother and stepdad drink lots of caffeine-free diet coke, but my mother absolutely *freaked out* when I got some caffeine pills/candy/gum to help with energy issues I was having at school.
nu-uh, I read in a book I found under ground. I wish I could show you. You'll just have to believe me. 
>Like getting my funk on.

FTFY
Most indeed. Which brings up the question of cold-brewed coffee and tea. And green coffee beverages.
Seriously, there's enough bizarre about the Mormon theology, nothing need be invented.
Owning shares =|= owning
He actually said Pepsi, not Coke, but I'm sure the origins of the urban legend are the same.
How and why would u ever believe this??
Its a clarification that not only the public, but also every mormon I've ever met needed...
Oh, the article stated that hot chocolate is now allowed. What is the reasoning behind this? Enlightenment through denial of carnal pleasures, or some such belief?
Hot chocolate has never been a "hot drink" in Mormon doctrine.  The phrase "hot drink" was explained by Joseph Smith to explicitly, and only, mean tea and coffee.
Perhaps hot cocoa wasn't readily available when the hot beverage prohibition was put in place?
Perhaps hot drinks are generally enjoyable and relaxing, while a cold Pepsi would fall closer to refreshing. Mormons are big on work ethic, right? Maybe they just don't support kicking your feet up and enjoying a nice coffee.
Addictive properties 
What about soup?  
But...iced coffee...starts out as "hot" but then gets cold...so, is it considered "bad" if it's hot at the time of "creation" or at the time of consumption?
I have to go up into my attic for awhile. I'll have my answer written on some flatware.
citation? [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_Mormonism) lists 1978 as the year the Mormon church started accepting black people into the mormon priesthood, although they were always welcome in the church.


Ain't got shit on Scientologists.
[deleted]
I was born in Hawaii at the same hospital (Kapi'olani Women and Children's Medical Center) and my long form birth certificate looks nothing like his.  Not to say that his isn't real, but I have no idea why that would happen.
It's because Doctrine and Covenants 89, the Mormon doctrine were this health code originates from, was written in 1833. At the time, the phrase "hot drinks" specifically referred to coffee and tea.
And it's made of goooooooooold...
Pepsi is mentioned in the Snopes article as another company the Mormon Church owned. Again, it was False. 
The Snopes article specifically mentions Pepsi as a variant of the rumor, and says its not true either...
Hot chocolate has always been allowed. 

Tea and coffee were specifically forbidden, and it was speculated that caffeine was the reason.

The Word of Wisdom health code is treated more as a measure of obedience than a real attempt at being healthy.


Drinking forbidden drinks or smoking can keep a member out of the temple. Yet binging on fat-loaded golden potato casserole and sugary desserts has no such consequence.




***Edit***: Looking through older quotes about the "hot drinks" part of the Word of Wisdom, it looks like some early members interpreted it differently.

Some interpreted it to mean that hot soups, hot cocoa, and hot liquids in general were unhealthy. Considering the fad health crazes sweeping through America at that time, that makes sense.

[This blog](http://vsom.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/the-interplay-of-culture-and-doctrine/) gives more background.


Neither was meth. 

If 'your body is a temple, and polluting it with poison is disrespectful to your creator' is NOT the reason to avoid coffee... then what IS the reason?
You can sip with spoon but you cannot put in a mug and drink it? Maybe? 
I would be surprised if heat wasn't involved in the manufacturing process of coke too but I could be wrong..
What about cold-brewed coffee?
We don't need coffee creationists here. 
Two words - Cold-press.

OK, one hyphenate.
Truth. At least Mormons practice what they preach and work their asses off. Scientologists just want to control people by any means necessary. Mormonism may have its moments of stupidity but Scientology is evil incarnate.
[deleted]
On the same date I'm sure...
Right.  And if it were written today???  
Moreover it seems that was written out of something other than an arbitrary 'don't drink these' thought meaning they are willfully duping their own system.  Silliness to the infinite.  
The Snopes article goes against the claim that the Mormon church owns a controlling share. /u/dewanaowango says that the church owns a lot of shares. Those two aren't contradictory. As the article says, owning even a small percentage of the company would be a significant financial investment. At the same time, it's possible that this announcement, increasing the potential audience in the US, could increase the stock price.

I have no idea either way if it's true, but you need some other evidence to prove or disprove it.
It is very likely that Coke and Pepsi lobbied the LDS to allow their drinks to be consumed. Corporations lobbying to chabge a religion, gotta love America. 
"Shut up and obey your betters"
Did you receive this in a vision?  Youre a prophet, maybe?
That HFCS does not boil itself. 
Defintiely involved in the storage of it. Non-refridgerated truck, in sun all day. Wonder if they have a temperature for what is considered hot. Anything above 98.6 degrees F. perhaps?
Mormons have their moments of evil too; for a good example, just look up California's Proposition 8.
[deleted]
No, I'm 18. I don't know how old he is. At least 35 since he's president.  I was supposed to be born at Tripler Army Medical Center but my brother died there and my mom wanted me born at Kapi'olani instead.  
If it were written today, it would specifically say coffee and tea. Modern materials made by the church, such as *Preach My Gospel*, the manual missionaries use to teach, or *True to the Faith*, which is a gospel reference book, will specifically say alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and harmful drugs, in terms of the specific don'ts.

And I'm not sure what you mean by your second point. I would consider the no coffee or tea to be essentially arbitrary. But, in the context of religion, particularly that of Judeo-Christian, arbitrary requests from God aren't that far-fetched. I understand that it would seem silly to you though, if you're basically taking this one piece of a larger puzzle and trying to fit it in your own understanding of the world.
As a former Mormon, this does not seem probable.

The Word of Wisdom is an effective way of judging the worthiness of members. It's useful for leadership to measure obedience. It keeps members focused on shallow, petty rules. It exaggerates the difference between members and "the world." It's a higher law and way for members to feel special. A little sacrifice is good for the community.
Ah. So, when a neighbor or relative or coworker breaks this rule, it's a sort of litmus test. An early indicator that they may be willing to defy authority in other ways. 

Clever, that. 
Yes kelob alien told me during the abduction. And he gave me new 10 commandment including one should have at least 2 bacon a day. 
I like "on the download".  I'm going to use it in a sentence this week hopefully.
So you think it's weird that in 1994 they weren't using the same form/certificate as they had in 1961?

33 years and a technological revolution pass and you think it's *weird* that a form has been changed... I think it'd be pretty strange if they hadn't changed it to be perfectly honest.
Right, I would guess the list of no-no things to eat would be pretty dang long nowadays.  And this is what strikes me about this part specifically, that it looks to me that they did this out of some sense of what's healthy.  That would be the spirit of what was written and folks are happy to just follow the exact wording.  Like it's a law they don't agree with but begrudgingly follow to only the extent they have to.  

The second point really had to do with the expansion I just did on the first.  The arbitrary requests from a god however are no less silly.  This I guess is my own understanding of the world like I understand that water is wet and we breathe air, just like everyone else.  
So it's kind of the religious equivalent of criminalizing "failure to obey lawful orders" and "resisting arrest", so that the authorities have an excuse to punish someone they just plain don't like?
I read this in Bill Compton's voice.
Just as a totally irrelevant data point my sister and I were born in the same hospital, 2 years apart, and our birth certificates look totally different. 
'93, but I see your point.  I guess that's not really that weird.  
Those who only begrudgingly follow the exact, specific things of the health code aren't truly living it. There's more to it than the specific don'ts that members are expected to understand and live. That's why there isn't an extensive, exhaustive list of do's and don'ts.

And like I said, it's unsurprising to me that you would find this sort of thing silly without proper background or context. The health code is part of a much larger system which, like most systems of belief, fits together in a logical, coherent way when taken as a whole.

And yes, water is wet, and we breathe air. This is not relevant information.
It's more subtle than that, usually. IMO, it's mostly a way to show God, other members, and the world that you're obedient and free from vices.
One of you is not who he/she seems ...
More to it huh?  I've lived, worked, trained and been decent friends with many folks from this walk, a few of notable standing.  Not a single one of them didn't draw outside the lines here.  Not one. 
 
Apologies but I'm not looking to inspire you.  This was really a general observation/annoyance.  And this whole subject defies logic so please stop trying to go there.  

The relevance of air and water may have been lost on you.  Apologies again.  Let it go Indy, let it go.  
Believe it or not, just because you've known Mormons doesn't mean they've told you every proper facet of their faith. The don'ts of the health code are definitely the most visible and mentioned part of it, [but that doesn't mean there's not more to it](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&locale=0&sourceId=56c6991a83d20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&vgnextoid=198bf4b13819d110VgnVCM1000003a94610aRCRD). Also, you claim that nobody draws outside the line, when an important part of the whole greater conversation here is that some Mormons choose not to drink caffeine. I've also known families which don't drink sodas at all, and pattern their meals after the health code.

Anyway, this whole subject defies *your* logic. The point I'm making with this has to do with anthropology. Despite what you may think, your reasoning and system of beliefs is not as obvious as the properties of water or air. What I'm saying is that the only reason you don't understand is because you don't seek to understand. You take a single piece of a system of beliefs and attempt to fit it into your own system of beliefs, and that just doesn't work. In order to truly understand other people and their beliefs, one has to consider the workings of the entire system of beliefs and how they all logically fit together.

For example, consider the beliefs of the Kalahari Bushmen of Africa. Their belief system is very much based around hunting. If I were to take single pieces of their beliefs, they wouldn't make any sense at all. But, given their culture and society of hunting, and examining a more complete picture of their beliefs along with this proper context, their general beliefs fit together logically. Not necessarily true by my own standards- but logical.

I feel like apple could make a hilarious commercial with all other cell phone companies posting ‘via iPhone,’ it seems to happen often enough.
Or they weren't giving a free unit so they use the phone they had....

I played hockey with a speech writer for the Coke A Cola company.  He could not hold in his hands or drink a Pepsi.  For real.  Gatorade was off limits as Coke had a competing product. 
Microsoft dealt with the same issues for a time. One of the only reasons the Zune supposedly was made was because Gates and Balmer were tired of catching employees listening to iPods all over the campus. 

The Zune wasn't even their first attempt either. They had two other "iPod Killers" released in 2004 (Portable Media Center) and 2005's Plays for Sure campaign for devices certified to work with Windows both of which landed with a wet fart.

In the end they banned any Apple devices not being used for development from the campus (aside fun fact, the Xbox 360 dev kit was Mac Pro G5s with the Xbox OS initially), and employees were offered Zunes if they traded in their iPods and even that didn't work.

Even more hilarious is that this happened because they normally have to use a VPN to get around their own country's firewall that blocks twitter!

It is surprising that something like this even makes the news in the international media. The entire BBC article is based on something Reuters wrote, which in turn is based on some "memo" that they somehow obtained. 

Anything to bash China with, I suppose. 
That's somewhat surprising. Apple has actually been losing market share in China as the domestic OEMs have become more popular.
Someone just won an all inclusive giveaway for a free 6 month stay at a luxury re-education facility. 
As an android fanboy, a huge supporter of open source, a hater of apple, a former cell phone tech, and an IT professional:

iPhone is the most secure platform, any company not using them as their standard corporate phone has a long and difficult battle to maintain security. No company will be able to compete with apple on that front because of the advantages of a closed environment, and shouldn't bother trying.
Way back in the mid 80s, Disneyland employees wore Magic Mountain shirts to work (a group of them). So some Magic Mountain employees decided to return the "favor". They wore Disneyland shirts to work. That did not go over well with Magic Mountain management. 
oh shit, they're going to be sent to one of their sweatshops. 
 Office already did it, this show needs new writers
That's kind of funny.

Sent from a pretentious company's product.
Hahaha.. who the hell still uses iPhones :')
Do they give their PR staff free phones?
I think Huawei is reaction is reasonable. This guy is a PR official, such mistake is a pretty harsh testament of his/her professionality. 
i doubt the misconception that staff was punished because they own iphone. but the staff is dumb enough not to tweet/work on huawei phone and keep his/her personal phone from work.

&#x200B;

i work for particular telco, i have line with other brands too. my company doesn't forbid that but if i go around saying that hey, that brand is way better than mine or subtlety let other knew i'm using another brand, people would think that other brand is waay better because the staff is not using their own service.

&#x200B;

this apply here. dumb employee.
Does that mean Apple just lost half the planets business because.....trump?
iPhone?!?

Off to the ‘re-education’ camps for you!
Huawei is crap. Impressed their employees can afford IPhones tho.
their punishment? having to own an iphone.
Punished as in.. tortured then death penalty?
my Chinese friend has a Huawei phone. He said the reason he switched like many of his friends was because of Trumps anti-China policy with trade etc.
Apple probably paid them to do it in order to boost demand for iPhones in China after their weak results last quarter.
I mean Huawei basically ripped off the Iphone anyway. We sure this wasn't just a Huawei ripoff that they forgot to remove the signature part? 
Yep.  We were at a poet game picnic and the drinks dude liked Pepsi so the guy went drinkless. 

This was early 90s so no camera phones so I didn’t really understand it, but better safe than Pepsi?
No longer employed with them. I used to love drinking amp, but would have to slap a monster sticker on it when in uniform. 

Quite a story right there.
Don't joke about this, I work for Pepsico, and tested positive for Coke.

It was only after I proved those bastards in Atlanta that I didn't make a dime off the stuff, that I was able to keep my job.
One of my friends works for Dr. Pepper and she said she can get in trouble for drinking beverages from rival companies. If she does drink them, she has to put a cover of some kind over the can or bottle or at least turn the label inward towards her hand so it can't be seen. She even said that she's not allowed to be seen in public with a group of her friends if too many of them are drinking Pepsi or Coke products.

Thankfully I like Dr. Pepper, but I like giving her shit about the "sacrifices" I make buying only Dr. Pepper/Snapple products so that she can hang out with us in public.
Yea I always find the 'outrage' over this story funny since several of our own companies here do the exact same thing. 
What's interesting about this is that there is a line being drawn. I didn't know PepsiCo owned Gatorade or Monster until reading this.

American food conglomerates are so huge that each company probably has a competitor for everything. Where is the line of common knowledge drawn?
There is a rumor they’re firing people for associating with Apple products
That's a lot of assumptions,  at least if it's based on just the linked article.  Can easily make counter-assumptions.

> The article implies that they want their employees to choose their phones over competitors.

It implies that would rather not have official social media posts be posted from a competing brand, regardless of cause. 

> If they wanted their communications to be from specific phones then they should have issued them.

Assuming they didn't issue them to the people who are supposed to manage theses accounts.

> Not saying it isn't a faux pas, but it seems a problem of their own making.

Unless they did issue devices and clear rules and these employees failed to follow them.

I agree there still a problem if their own employees, at least in those positions, wind up using a competing device (not particularly buying their cover story), but not from a business-failing-their-employees stance.
actually kind of telling when you don't use the products you make...

If they are in the Marketting department (if they posted an “Official Tweet”, I would assume they were), they should be pushing the company line all the time.
This person should get fired for being crap at their job.
This China. Bitch do what we say. 
My best friend works in the flagship Apple store in downtown HK. If he pulls out an Android phone at work he'll get fired. His exact words to me when I asked why he has 2 phones. (Apple and Android)
It's called Communism
It's interesting because that sort of corporate behavior has been explicitly illegal in the US for over 50 years.  It's the same law that says GM employees can't be required to buy GM cars.
As an ex Huawei employee, can confirm that almost 95% of employees used iPhone when I was there. But again , it was years ago before they started producing decent android phones. 
In China you're loyal to China, even if you have to spend your own money. This is the country with modern day concentration camps.
this is china, no fucking cares in terms of rules.
Also, if they drink anything other then the premade state koolaid, they lose a kidney.
> The article implies that they want their employees to choose their phones over competitors.

That's sort of China's style. "We want you to love our company. In fact, we'll badly punish you if you don't want to love us".
That's a great idea!
That wouldn’t make sense for apples brand. They depict their products as the gold standard and they do not compare their products to other brands. That would be beneath them and it should be. Apple does not need to compare themselves to other brands. The market leader does not compare themselves to the competitikn
I read this and jumped right into the apple circleierk and was not disappointed with what I saw. Great b8 intentional or not.

[Eat your own dog food](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eatyourowndogfood.asp) is the term for it.
Interesting you bring this up. Why did they never do this enforcement with Windows Phones?
"landed with a wet fart"    Adding this phrase to my lexicon.  Thank you. 
Oh wow I totally remember plays for sure and the portable media center devices. I worked for creative labs at their tech support center back in the day. Wet fart is 100% accurate lol!
the tweet was screenshotted before it was deleted. the basic facts of the story seem to be accurate; now whether the internal reaction was the one that was reported is another question.
Not really. Basically true of all industries. Foreign businesses get muscled out as much as possible. Until recently, and arguably still, it has been near impossible to enforce IP law. And courts don't usually rule in favor of foreign run enterprises
But... Knox Workspace...?

Genuinely curious here. 
Like having to write lines on the blackboard, he will now have to make 20,000 iphones as punishment
If they're important enough maybe. Better hope they're not an organ match for anyone more important.
No. There's political trends outside of the US too. China is becoming very anti foreign business. iPhone already has to create a special market and tweaks to their phones. Not that any of this matters. People love iPhones in China too. If apple was banned from the Chinese market China would lose quite a bit as well. 
So your friend switched to a Huawei because of trump? What sane person factors that in when buying a phone?
Never underestimate the power of "China Number 1 brand" propaganda.

But...i bought a Huawei because it's a fantastic handset for what I need and a fraction of the price of an iPhone. 

I've also not had an iPhone since the 3 but there's plenty of choice for Android devices but blimey, this Huawei is good!
>. She even said that she's not allowed to be seen in public with a group of her friends if too many of them are drinking Pepsi or Coke products.

God damn, we *need* to start demanding pay for these kinds of life intrusions. 

Is she in the clock when she's with her friends out elsewhere in public or not??? 

I was pretty sure Coke distributed Dr. Pepper, but then I looked and saw it was owned by Keurig now.

Weird.
Paid spokespeople can't be seen with Pepsi products but employees can drink it at work and only get the stink eye

Tying it nationalism is silly, but it's shit corporate behavior no matter how common.
Pepsi owns Mountain Dew, Tropicana orange juice, Quaker Oats, Frito Lay(all the chips/cookies etc that come with that label) and a slew of other stuff.

Source: Dad has worked for Pepsi for the past 30 years. 
While it may not be an immediate dismissal... continued association with with a major competitor's product in an American company will significantly restrict your place in the company (e.g. Coca-Cola & Pepsi). A number of livelihoods are tied to the performance of a company, so it's taken seriously. Plus, it's bad optics as is the case here.

This particular demotion instance is being seen as "China ~ Bad", but you have to acknowledge how big of a deal this is. Someone responsible for pr/social media essentially advertised a major competitor's brand... in a significant manner. That's grounds for dismissal.
In Japanese car factories, you Cannot use company parking to park a different brand of car from the one you’re working at.  

Is that the same in the US?
So that’s why they fired Johnny Appleseed 
As all companies should.
>It implies that would rather not have official social media posts be posted from a competing brand, regardless of cause.

Then why on god's earth are they making people do official posts on their social media from personal phones?

>Assuming they didn't issue them to the people who are supposed to manage theses accounts.
>
Unless they did issue devices and clear rules and these employees failed to follow them.

It bothers me that you're willing to give the company more of a benefit of the doubt than the employees. When the hell has a multi-million dollar company ever told the truth when a lie would benefit them more?

Huawei is crap and this year Chinese phones have been caught cheating benchmarks. Despite what my fellow redditors in r/android think price isn't everything and the Chinese having the my info is 5x worse than the US having it. They have Uighurs in concentration/slave camps for god's sake.
Ehh, it can be more than that. It could be his entire family uses iphone. If his family uses apple specific apps (isnt there one of the video call ones) or he has bought a bunch of apple apps, it makes sense for him to stay on it.

IF the company wanted the employee to use a huawei phone to tweet their social media, then they need to provide a work phone.

If they have provided a work phone, its 100% the employees fault.
Do all of the Mclaren mechanics drive Mclarens?
Hah! Don’t ever go to a Google campus.  It’s 80% iPhones.  
Not necessarily.  I'd imagine a company that had a broad mix of people using different products would innovate faster.

Can you stop being overdramatic?  Because you're talking out of your ass.  Oh no!!  

They've all been taken away and any trace of them is gone!! They work in underground mines toiling away until it's there time to be executed and have their organs stolen!  And then they have to pay for their own execution!  And then the government stomps on puppies all while doing this!
Boy do you hold a grudge.  I mean is it just against the Chinese government or is it some racial aspect towards it?
Remember those I’m a Mac and I’m a PC commercials?

This only works if consumers believe it to be true, I don't think that is the case right now.

Actually, that was their entire advertising campaign for years, and arguably more successful than their current approach.   
  
>The market leader does not compare themselves to the competitikn  
  
If they are smart they do, at least in the consumer electronics space.  
If you go into settings -> mail -> signature, you can remove it 
Depending on where you live, putting Trumper stickers on your car might *be* smart.
> Reason? Optics.

Yup. Worked for many corporations where it was taboo to even be seen near a competitor's product. "If someone from Company A is using competing Company B's product, doesn't that mean that person believe Company B's product is better than Company A's?" Regardless if that is true, perception is reality and even giving a perception of that can be bad in corporate's eyes.
Tricon restaurants were owned by Pepsi in the 90s. They spun off into Yum brands which still owns Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell. That’s why you can only get Pepsi products at those restaurants. Makes sense for a Coke representative to not be able to eat at those. 
It's not what the plants crave.
Christopher Robin comes to mind.
It would be a better strategy if they made people food instead.
Lol I actually owned a RIO when I first worked for Apple and when the iPod was released even WE couldn’t get it for free. We had to pay a reduced staff rate for them and not till 6 months after release they were so in demand. 

And those 1st gens were a TANK. I finally sold mine on eBay 3 years ago with a new battery installed but aside from that it worked perfectly. That’s pretty impressive considering it was a mechanical hard drive and mechanical buttons. 
I don't think you can pin this entirely on unfair trade practices/IP theft. There are other factors at work here.

China's noveaux-riches used to reflexively buy things purely as status symbols, especially anything and everything gaudy, golden and/or plastered with a famous logo. It's no coincidence Apple released gold iPhones at the same time it started making a bigger push into China and other emerging markets with similar tastes. The problem for Apple is that consumer tastes have since matured and moved on to more practical consumption, which favors the domestic OEMs offering better cost-performance. Those who still go for Apple tend to be more "aspirational" buyers, people who are lower-middle class who can barely afford the product but are trying to pass as being better off than they actually are while those who actually have the money are spending their money on bigger and better things, like Chinese-made electric cars, etc.

Another factor is the overall slowdown in innovation from both Apple and Android OEMs. Hardware matters less and less, and the app offerings for the two platforms are now mostly the same. So unless Apple offers something truly novel and different, not just bigger screens, thinner bezels, etc., there's nothing apart from their logo to draw customers (and this, as explained above, is becoming less effective of a draw).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
Honestly, almost every factor you can consider comes down to the ecosystem it's being deployed in and the requirements and restrictions of the company, except two:

- T2 SEP chip backing up the biometrics and encryption

- Closed ecosystem

As someone who has spent years in cell phone repair, apple devices with the T2 chip are the only things I have ever come across that are industry wide considered as parts only as soon as they are locked. Even if some way to bypass them has been found in the last few months, any data on the device is lost.

As for the ecosystem, Apple has very strict checks, tests, and conditions for publishing software, and while some fall through the cracks, the system has a demonstrably better track record than Android.

Another effect of the closed ecosystem is that security patches are released on a much more rapid schedule than other platforms, and are more consistently applied and deployed. Most times when some CVE is found Apple is one of the first to push a fix, often weeks or months ahead of other manufacturers, if at all.

When you contrast that with the Android ecosystem and the inherent security concerns that arise from wildly varying patch policies, hardware, less software controls, and companies like Huawei and Xiaomi, the decision seems unquestionable.
Same reason anyone boycotts any product because of their own deeply held political beliefs?
It's an Anti-American thing in China right now. That's how much he's pissed them off.
huawei makes great phones for good prices. i think everyone would agree that this is the case. the worry from westerners is all about the software backdoors that are likely being installed in the phones lol

considering the FBI and many organizations have literally come out and said not to buy Huawei and ZTE phones, i'd guess that this is still happening
Spy phone ! :P
>God damn, we need to start demanding pay for these kinds of life intrusions.

No. We need to start demanding laws against this horseshit. Employees shouldn't be forced to make their personal lives a billboard for the company they work for.
Salaried Position probably.
Well you'll not get demoted like this fellow, you'll also probably not get the next 'promotion' though. It's a bit more than the 'stink eye'. 
...Why the hell are they making official social media posts on their personal phones anyways? Shouldn't the company have issued them the tools to do their job? This is fucked.
At least there's one thing I think we can all agree on...

RC is the best cola
It's impossible to do this with tech companies.  
A lot of Google Engineers use iPhones.  
The issue is this was their publicist and to be honest if your job is to market a product and you use a competitor's product while doing it, you're not doing your job so it shouldn't come as a surprise you get shit canned.  
Nobody working for coke is going to get fired for drinking Pepsi... even if on work, that’s their own personal soda. What they should have done was issue a free phone, but they didn’t, so they are now firing employees for their own personal choices... seems all around sketchy and a ploy to scare their own employees into buying their products...
In this instance, I definitely would have fired the person as well. You absolutely cannot fuck up an official tweet like that.
I heard stories that GM had such company policy, or it is more like a social pressure to 'force' their employees buy their own products. 
> Then why on god's earth are they making people do official posts on their social media from personal phones?

*Making* them? Making them.  I must not have read the same article.  Could you link and point to the part where they're making them do so?

Tell you what, though, I checked the article from the BBC and they referenced Reuters.  
Reuters' article: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iphone/chinese-phone-maker-huawei-punishes-employees-for-iphone-tweet-blunder-idUSKCN1OY0B2  

Note how I said I didn't buy their cover story?  

> The memo said the incident, which was linked to "VPN problems" with a desktop computer, had "caused damage to the Huawei brand", Reuters reported

That's because the BBC's is incomplete.  From the Reuters article:  

> The mistake occurred when outsourced social media handler Sapient experienced “VPN problems” with a desktop computer so used an iPhone with a roaming SIM card in order to send the message on time at midnight, Huawei said in the memo.

That I could see happening.  But in that case, 1. That's not Huawei employees, 2. the only 'forced' was in the third party company's employee's mind thinking that they needed to get that tweet out no matter what, and 3.  the employees that did get punished (demotions/pay cuts/freezes) did not send the tweet but within their corporate structure (and culture) are responsible all the same;

> It said it had demoted two employees responsible by one rank and reduced their monthly salaries by 5,000 yuan ($728.27).  
> The pay rank of one of the employees - Huawei’s digital marketing director - will also be frozen for 12 months, it said. 

because

> Employees must now “tighten management of suppliers and partners,” Huawei said in its memo. “The incident exposed flaws in our processes and management.”  

( this quote from the Bloomberg article; https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-04/huawei-demotes-workers-after-embarrassing-tweet-from-an-iphone )

tl;dr: The BBC article is incomplete which readily leads to assumptions, including but not limited to - apparently - Huawei making their employees use personal phones to post to Huawei official social media accounts and then punishing them when that post gets auto-tagged with a competing company's product name thanks to a spammy app.
I had a Nexus 6P. At first, it was great. Then, it randomly went into a boot loop and nothing fixed it. It took over **forty** days for me to get my phone RMA'd. (I remember because it perfectly coincided with lent - making for a cheap joke). The one I received? Bricked in two weeks. It was just sitting in my pocket and all of a sudden I felt my phone getting warm. Took my phone out and - bam - dead. I just said "screw it" at that point and moved back to the Galaxy line of phones.

Yeah, but in the case of iPhones the majority actually want the Apple product.
That was back before Mac re-established itself as the premium product. They were fighting tooth and nail to compete with PC as the premier out-of-the-box desktop solution.
Made sense for computers Because PC is market leader. 
Apple positions themselves as a lifestyle brand, not a consumer electronics products.   Apple is viewed as the gold standard in the US market hence why they receive the vast majority of revenue a profits in the phone space.  Their comparison campaign was for computers when they had very little market share. 
Thank you so much

It's funny because most people I know consider them completely exchangeable products.  There certainly are people that really want one instead of the other, but not many from what I've seen.  It's almost like a commodity. I just ask for "a cola" at the restaurant and I wouldn't even know what I'm drinking.

Soda companies take their shit way to seriously.  

“Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?” -- what Steve Jobs said to Pepsi executive John Sculley to lure him to Apple.
I'm not pinning it solely on IP theft. But it's a shit show to run something in China if you're not Chinese. Hoops are literally grafted onto you to jump through. 
Buying a cellphone from a totalitarian government to own the cons?
would make sense if apple themselves were actively employing ant-chinese policies, but apple loves china so it's kind of strange to boycott them lol. at that point youd need to boycott any american designed product
The intelligence community has already been exposed of doing this to US citizens though so what's the difference? The difference is they won't be able to spy on their own citizens anymore :(
Of course, I'm under no illusion - the boys in Beijing have access to me handset.

> Nobody working for coke is going to get fired for drinking Pepsi... even if on work

1. Pepsi products are not permitted in Coke offices... even in public meeting spaces. Yes, you are typically offered a replacement product in exchange for discarding the offending product. You also can't wear Pepsi-branded clothing to work.

2. As I mentioned, you won't be immediately fired for intentionally & consistently bringing in a competitor's product to the work space (if you made it through). But the higher your role, the more likely you'd be dismissed or made redundant for something unrelated. It'll be considered poor judgement to flaunt the competitor's brand in a space that will give undue visibility.
>	Nobody working for coke is going to get fired for drinking Pepsi

Actually..

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/world/coke-worker-sacked-for-drinking-pepsi-20030615-gdgxls.html
> Nobody working for coke is going to get fired for drinking Pepsi... even if on work, that’s their own personal soda. 

If the employee posted Pepsi promotion-related content to an official Coke social media account, there would be consequences up to termination or demotion, the former being what the employee received in this story.
This is not true, I had a friend who is doing contractor work at one of the big fashion companies. She was specifically told that she can't wear anything from any competitor brands.
That’s a great way to put it, because as you very well may know the Japanese social pressure is heavily balanced against the outsider.  I’m not sure if it’s policy as the Japanese may have overturned that rule by now.
My Note 9 is easily the best phone I have ever owned. I loved my Nexus 5 and my S8 but neither is close to the Note.
They have the most abysmal customer phone and chat support I've ever dealt with, but once I got past it, they handled my case pretty well. It is no exaggeration that they were the worst English speakers I've encountered on the phone, they were terribly unprepared, and their browser based chat support lied to me several times (some agents were more capable than others...). 

That said, their poor questioning made it easy to convince them I needed an RMA due to issues that were their fault, and they were clearly trying to improve the way they executed repairs, as mine was pretty fast. I think early on they were sending them to china or they had limited repair centers in the US, and then later, once they recognized they had so many issues (and likely because of Google's pressure), they contracted more repair centers in the US. When I had to RMA my phone due to premature shutdown, after getting past the terrible communication, my phone was returned to me about a week after shipping it out, and not only did they fix the issue, but they also replaced my slightly cracked screen for free. 

It's probably worth mentioning that several months later the phone got the boot loop issue and eventually was a brick though... The phone was great when it worked, and it's possible they've improved since then, as this was on of their earlier more premium phones, but with that customer support experience and the security risks the company presents, I wouldn't buy their products again. 
I loved my 6p until I tried to play games on it. Turns out they had some dual CPU shit where it would swap to a terrible core if the phone got warm.

Then I too got the boot loop. Luckily I bought through Google so I got in on that free pixel XL replacement. Fuck Huawei and their shitty phones.
i love my galaxy
I wish the 6p was flawless. It could have been one of my favorite phones.
my nexus had a boot loop too about a year and a half after getting it but I got a oneplus 5t and it's been amazing so far.
Right now we do or did we acknowledge it and move forward?
The Note 9 is the best phone I have ever owned an S8 is at a good price right now and has plenty of power. I personally don't like Apple but it's hard argue that their phones aren't good and the have a good range of options.
It's an example of the difference between totalitarian shitbox. People say "I'd rather China have the data than the US" which is incredibly naive.

Fanboyism or astroturf?
> they kill you right there on your country

Remember that time that the US invaded the EU last year?  
Me neither.
What a shit argument. A handful of terrorists vs. millions of innocent families.
Do we designate an entire ethnic subsection as dangerous and round up them and their families indiscriminately for "re-education". Declaring large swaths of innocent citizens subversive is right out of a totalitarian handbook. We rounded up Japanese citizens during ww2 but we didn't "re-educate" them and have since apologized and paid reparations. That won't happen in China.
You buy 1 phone a year, maybe 2.  It's reasonable to expect that a marketing person for a major phone company would use their phones.  Meanwhile, you buy a thousand or so meals a year, and it's unreasonable to expect them to always eat the same food.  However, it would be reasonable to expect that a candid marketing shot to not include Burger King in the background. 

This was a twitter post that said "Via Twitter for iPhone" while advertising for Huawei.  Given that a Coke driver can be fired for being seen drinking a Pepsi, it seems reasonable that this much larger gaffe is punishable.

Also, I think the last McDonald's CEO did say that he ate there daily.
I've always felt like closed ecosystems get a bit weird.  Much better to have people promoting the good aspects of each ecosystem so that yours doesn't miss anything obvious.
I didn’t realize there was a statute of limitations to your comment. Ten years huh? I didn’t realize Apple’s **brand** was so young. 
Who knew both the PC and the actor that played the PC would go on to be wildly more successful than the Macintosh and its actor.
And Apple is still a joke compare to PC. Yesterday's technology at tomorrow's prices.
Nah macs were a premium product for years before that advert came out, they just weren’t as mainstream. 
Android is the market leader. iPhone commands a very low market share.
If you can't beat 'em at least avoid having your car get vandalized.
This is exactly why they care about the "optics".  Their brand image is the only competitive advantage; it is literally all they have to sell.

The entire value of their company consists of the thoughts inside the public's heads.  It is more of a religion than a product.
Certainly some of the recent court rulings against them have been a challenge, but I think Apple would still be facing headwinds regardless.
I'm not saying it was a smart move. They obviously dislike Trump more than the Chinese government.
Huawei phones are also pretty good. 
I dont know. I'm not trying to make sense of it beyond what I assume is the core motive. 
what exposement are you referring to when you say they were 'already' exposed? are you talking about cell phones or what? considering the FBI recently had to pay a 3rd party company to build an iphone password cracker i have my doubts that they have backdoors in the phones
Why does the average person think they’re important enough to be spied on? And do people honestly think Huawei has the resources to just sit and look at literally everyone’s phone? 
Oh look, one of those people who think work is voluntary. Hey, go ahead and spend a few months without a job and then tell me having one is optional.

Better link - don't use google's amp bullshit.

Apparently they were just trying to get rid of a pro-union employee and used this as an excuse. Still shitty 
Did the post read “-sent from my iPhone”?

Because that’s he only way your analogy makes sense 
That makes sense at a private fashion show. But she wouldn’t be fired for wearing one in the street. 

Clothes are very different from phones. You own multiple clothes, you usually only own one phone. If they wanted their employees to use their products they should have handed out company phones 
You sound like a man who's never had to cancel AOL.
HTC had the best RMA service i've had. my old desire went into a bootloop about 11 months in.  they picked it up within a 1 hour timeslot on a tuesday and i had a refurb phone dropped off within the same 1 hour timeslot on the thursday.

moved on to a galaxy straight away but loved that service though
I usually get a new phone every 2 to 3 years. Theres no difference between an S8 and a S9. Probably wont get the S10 cause it's so damn expensive

Hate totalitarian regimes, those are the sum of all evil,
America has to regain leadership promoting and attracting talent. 
China won’t stop expanding its influence just because the common, mostly American opinion, of being a “shitbox”.  Time will tell, 
They have to obey legal subpoenas. You want them to all go to jail for you?

Fight the laws that make this possible.
A real Hauwei employee would be using an iphone
Go ask the illegals in the US:
Actually...Japanese Americans were forced to sign a loyalty pledge.  And if they didn't, conditions got..worse.  Of course you'd be up for signing a loyalty pledge right?

"In 1943, the War Department, along with the War Relocation Authority (WRA) created a bureaucratic means of testing the loyalty of all adults and teens in the WRA camps. The first form was aimed at draft-age Nisei males and the second form at all other residents. The last two questions, numbers 27 and 28 - where affirmative answers signaled unwavering loyalty to the U.S. - created confusion and resentment.

Question 27 asked if an individual would be willing to serve as a combat soldier, nurse, or in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. The internees had been advised that if accepted, they would serve in a segregated unit. Many felt this was offensive. Serving in the military meant leaving their families behind in the terrible conditions of the camps. Some resisted the draft, because their constitutional rights were being violated.

Question 28 was even more confusing. It was a two part question with one answer: "Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States... and forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese emperor, to any other foreign government, power or organization?" Did an affirmative answer imply that they had once sworn allegiance to Japan? As a matter of principle some answered, "no" to both questions. For varied reasons, many respondents answered "no" to questions 27 and 28 and became known as "No-No Boys."

well for that they have the chinese spies. or buy a iphone and use reverse engineering  
I mean if you're going to judge for 10 years ago, we should all be calling Samsung apple ripoffs, because of what happened when the S1 came out, when in fact, they're probably the only one, apart from sony, who isn't copying Apple right now
Units or dollars?
Oh, yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head there.
I mean they aren't totally interchangeable to laymen. Just mostly. Fountain drink coke tastes like ass. Fountain drink pepsi tastes way better than regular pepsi. Fuck if I know why. 
Slave labor camps vs. Orange cheeto man.... pretty easy to see who's more evil.
At cheating benchmarks maybe.
It isn't about your personal shit.  It is about trade secrets, IP, and related information.  They don't need people to spy on you when the hardware itself is doing that and forwarding what it can back home.
You do realize that you can find a job while still working at another one right?...

Also, we're currently at a point where unemployment is at an all time low.

Maybe get your tiny head out of your large ass and you might actually know something about the real world
Looks like union busting and constructive dismissal, there is no coke only stipulations in any non-spokesperson contract I've ever heard of. Welcome to at will employment though where your employer has freedom but you don't besides the freedom to starve.
Jolt cola (and later gum) got me through football camp the week before high school started each summer. 
>could you bring in frito-lay chips with your lunch?

To work?

No. Over time there was an expectation to understand the range of *major* competitor brands and avoid them.

Again, it was an unspoken big deal... you also officially couldn't patronize companies that had a major contract with a competitor... certain hotel chains for instance.
Goes against your assertion.
I'm taking your metaphor and correctly adjusting it to the story events, which I recommend you read.
Firstly, I don't believe OP mentioned that was a fashion show.

Secondly...

>Clothes are very different from phones.

Funny you mention that.

I've also done work for a major apparel brand... you CANNOT wear major competitor clothing to work. AT ALL.

You'll be escorted off premises if you refuse to cover up the branding and almost certainly fired if you did it consistently.

In general, what we see from the article happens frequently in America. You'd notice this more working for a brand very protective of their image.
I have both s8 and s9.  and i hate to disagree but the s9 is so much better.  I run on AT&T.

S9 > S8 in battery life

S9 >>>>>> S8 in camera quality (especially slow mo vids at high def)

besides camera and battery life (which IMO as a dad this is 100% important to me), there's a better heft to the S9.  

the S9 has a much faster and better HR sensor (which I think I am the ONLY person to use).  

S9 > S8 in fingerprint sensor login

S9 has a better fingerprint location which makes it another reason why it's faster to login

S9 has a MUCH better sound.  S9 utilizes both speakers whereas the S8 only utilizes the bottom.  However, BLAME this on AT&T but the Dolby Atmos (aka enabling the top speaker) is turned off but a swipe down quickly turns it on.  Verizon is on by default.  dunno why. 


Opinions are like assholes, everyone has got one. What we don't have is an entire ethnicity rounded up in slave camps families and all, then left to die. Everything is shades of grey not black and white. China's grey is a lot darker though with wholesale round ups and millions affected. Get some perspective.
I want them to fight to disclose the requests like Google does. Instead they lie about them.
Ok but they weren't slaughtered and their families weren't threatened the way we see under totalitarian states. Was it wrong? Yes. Was it equivalent to what we see in China today? Not even close.
Is that a list of countries by concentration camp internment? I'm pretty sure NK and China have us beat by millions. Imagine comparing prison to the shit conditions in a concentration camp where you are basically expected to die.
Units. Apple still has around 60% of mobile device profits.
I'm not making an argument for China. I feel like half the people reading my comments are misunderstanding my point.
Are they even aware of the slave labor camps though? Assuming his friend lives in China, I imagine the media makes Trump look worse than it's own government
boy, you're taking some personal offense or something.  did the company do something to you?
>You do realize that you can find a job while still working at another one right?...

Have you ever actually had a job? If you're caught job-searching while employed, then your job is going to fire you as soon as they possibly can. 

You sound like one of those spoiled techie brats who got a 100k/year job that they've never had to work for in their life. "I can just have any job I want, whenever I want, and if that's not your life, you're just entitled and lazy!"
Man, those end-of-summer sport camps were brutal.
We’d going late night fishing on the weekends with a bunch of family. Jolt Cola and a giant bag of 39cent McDonald’s cheeseburgers was a must for every trip. 
So people that work for Pepsi couldn't go to Disney World/Land without possible backlash at work?
Not exactly. In the article it says the offer replacements, unlike Huawei, and that many lawyers say this was an overreach and was a cheap excuse to terminate an employee of 12 years because he was pro-union. The Pepsi wasn’t the deciding factor, it was his union stance. 
Ah, I missed that part.

What I find the most funny is that nobody in China can even access twitter without a VPN. So who is this targeted to? Western audiences? They don’t trust the brand because of the fact it’s owned by the Chinese government and can be strong armed into being a spying apparatus at a moments notice.

That, combined with their over the top response and the CCP kidnapping 13 Canadians makes me never want to buy a product made by them.
I worked for Tommy Hilfiger for a time (spit) and they said I could wear any jeans, but if they were other brands I had to tear the labels off. It's definitely a thing.
You’re telling me if you wear a competitors shirt in your own home you will get fired?

That’s flat out illegal. You could press charges over that in the states.
It's not right to have gitmo open just as it's not right to round up minorities.  You don't get to say it's OK to kill a few Muslims as long as your enemy is killing more Muslims.

They can't. It's not legal. 
I would call that market leader since the point of a business is to make money and not just ship units. I’m not an Apple fanboy,  just a marketing professional
Is that just profits from the devices, or does that include the fact that Apple gets App Store money and the Android manufacturers don't?
I don't think you made an argument for anything you were just stating your thoughts on their motives. Some people on reddit don't "read good"
LMAO you're a moron and not even worth arguing with.
My reference was for Coke. But I'd doubt Pepsi would hold an official function in Disney if it exclusively offered Coke products.

You missed the "official" context there.
> The Pepsi wasn’t the deciding factor, it was his union stance.

Ehh... that's not true. Most of Coke merchandisers are Union.
Huawei and other chinese phones are becoming increasingly popular in the west, so yes. Also, that whole point is unrelated. Disliking china in general doesn't really play into this story in any way.
> nobody in China can even access twitter without a VPN.

This is not a good image.

> So who is this targeted to? 

The **tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese who do use VPNs** and access Twitter?
near where i live is a Nissan manufacturing plant. if you own a Nissan vehicle you are allowed to park at the front part of the parking lot, closer to the building. non-Nissan owners must park farther away.
"to work"
"We have also never allowed any government direct access to Apple servers. And we never will." 



This is a blatant lie. Google has spent actual money fighting to release the requests. The documents released have clearly shown Apple along with basically every other major tech company have long been comprised.
Fighting to disclose in court is not illegal unless they do disclose.
Just devices, Apple's markup is huge compared to Android manufacturers.
Seems to be the case.
Just because they're union doesn't mean the higher-ups like it. In fact, that's kind of the point in quite a few cases.
In English?
Read the patriot act. They are not even allowed to tell anyone they got a notice.
Damn, their marketing is impressive, but I didn't realize that it was that impressive.
Doesn't matter, this is a coca cola household. 
when are companies gonna stop trying to be “woke” in their advertisements and go back to a person dubbing over someone fucking up in black and white and then that person using their product in color?
"No, Pepsi is *not* okay!"
I can see how it can come off as tone deaf, but it is a decent ad as far as ads go, and even the people who don't like the imagery are spreading the message.
Not really sure why ppl are pissed or divided on this. We have a young generation coming to age during at least a half decade of domestic protests ranging from equality to politicians not to mention what may seem to them a never ending and 'normal' conflict of violence in the Middle East as well as tensions that parallel Cold War era statues worldwide. Sounds like a pretty confusing place to come of age in if you ask me. Pepsi, imo, attempted and successfully created a message to this young generation that you have a right to speak your mind and it does not have to be violent thus the 'join the conversation' signs, or the peace and love signs etc. Jenner is picked bc she is a popular face for said generation (dont ask me why, im trying to keep this positive.) so in the end you have a commercial that promotes individual thinking and pride, marries that ideal with respect for police, not out of fear, but a human respect for peace and not hurting each other. That's how i see this and i think its pretty fucking cool and in good form. With that being said im still only buying coka cola, and continue to keep my streak of never seeing one episode of the kardashians alive. 
The idea that you can fix the types of issues people protest over with a can of Coke is pretty fucking stupid.
Let's be clear here, with a can of Coke you could but this is a can of Pepsi. Come on.
I think people are overanalyzing it. I don't think Pepsi is dismissing these social issues, which is why the signs aren't showing real issues (i.e. BLM, No Hate/No Wall, etc.)
It's not fixing an issue that's attempting to be accomplished. The point is to speak your mind without violence or ill will. 
And Pepsi somehow facilitates that?
I know it's a stretch for a soda company to attempt advertising something so complex but anything with a basic message of peace in conflict is good. It parallels apple's commercial using orwell's 1984 vision to promote individualism (buy apple and you think for yourself), now it's buy Pepsi and promote peace. 
I think that the explanation you're making is quite a stretch too.

The basic underlying message is that Pepsi brings people together, because that's the theme of like 90% of soda and fast food ads.  Ergo, Pepsi can somehow bring two sides together over complex social and political issues.  As if what we've been missing to fix these societal problems is Pepsi this entire time.
If the ppl at Pepsi think a can of soda will fix a protest then I'd say they are insane. If that's how you are viewing this message then that's on you. Not going to debate with a ridiculous notion such as that 
If Coca-Cola and Pepsi were smart, they'd sell their syrup *for* SodaStream machines. Save money on shipping and reach more customers at the same time.

Their executives' heads are probably lodged way too far up their own asses to think of such a thing, though. "MUST CRUSH ALL COMPETITORS. CRUSH KILL DESTROY"
CBS is compromised. These recent events just prove it more and more.
I never realized SodaStream was such a big threat to Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
CBS, being a private company, has the right to choose which companies advertise on their network. And in this case, they choose to not allow one company's ad. Your local newspaper, radio station and TV broadcaster all have this same right. No one is forced to do anything. Is it bad business for CBS to reject ads? Perhaps. But CBS has a right to conduct bad business too.
soda stream sodas taste terrible. But it did allow me to carbonate apple juice so that's pretty cool.
These guys own CNET too, woo hoo!
You would think they would explain what the fuck SodaStream is
Can soda stream legally use the brand labels for both coca-cola and pepsi in their ads?
Private companies doing things in the interest of their business.  Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

* Save Money
* Use Less Plastic
* Consume Healthier Drinks
* Support Novel/Innovative/Disruptive Products
* Piss Off Entrenched/Lazy/Minimally Innovative Firms

I think maybe it's time to invest in a SodaStream. I've always wanted one anyway.
I'm someone who is the epitome of "anti-big corporation", but I don't see anything wrong with this.

When I was in College I worked for a local music store. That music store had other competitors in the area, and we regularly advertised on billboards, as well as newpapers and radio spots.

In each advertising situation the owner of the store would work out a deal where we would gain "exclusive advertising rights" for our medium with the advertising outlets. This essentially meant that no other music stores would be allowed to advertise as long as we were advertising in those outlets.

In some cases we paid a higher rate, in other cases we provided hefty discounts to employees of the companies we paid for advertising from, or provided services to the companies we worked with. We set it up where it was mutually beneficial for all parties involved, and the end result was that we were the only music store that could advertise in those outlets.

It worked too. We were easily the most successful music store in the area. We were informed on several occassions that other music outlets tried to advertise and were denied due to exclusivity.

I don't really see anything wrong with this. I'm all for competition in the marketplace, and I see this as part of the competition. Much like how a business tries to woo a customer in with great service and wonderful relationships, you try to do the same with advertising outlets. Both benefit your business in the long run.

This is no different than the bar I go to regularly. I'm there every week with friends, and we get a "regular customer discount" on our bills. Sometimes a night of drinks and food is discounted upwards of 40%. Not every customer gets it, but we built a relationship with the establishment to get that type of treatment.

Life is about relationships and so is business. This is an example of that.
Sodastream is an Israeli owned company, expect CBS to issue an apology, pay a fine, contribute a large sum of cash to AIPAC and the ADL, and promptly air a bunch of Holocaust programmes. If they don't, watch as Coca Cola gets widely exposed for developing Fanta for the Nazis.
So are there not some sort of antitrust laws being broken by this?  
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! D: I <3 SodaStream. 
Ban? Sounds like a rejection to me. I guess "ban" makes better linkbait.
CBS can suck it. No love for CBS!
Looking afraid of a competitor is the wrong publicity to give to that competitor. I would never have watched the superbowl to hear about them, and I heard about them now. CBS with the guerrilla marketing.
And this kind of crap, kiddies, is why the Telecommunications "Reform" Act of 1996 needs to be repealed.  It's a stupid, stupid, stooopid idea to turn control of your media over to an oligarchy.
There is something [VERY wrong](http://www.palestinechronicle.com/old/view_article_details.php?id=17308) with SodaStream.
I am in favour of the ban, but for other reasons:  http://rabbibrant.com/2013/01/29/interfaith-coalition-launches-boycott-of-sodastream/
I felt bad for them thinking they were a small newcomer to the market with a clever idea until I did a little research and found out they've been around since 1903 and use proprietary valves on their CO2 canisters so they can charge 10-20x the going market rate to refill them, and that they sue companies that refill their canisters and tried to ban sales of them on ebay as well:

That's brilliant! I would go out and buy a sodastream RIGHT NOW if i could make it with pepsi products!!
Actually it'd make more sense to have their own, that way there's no revenue sharing. But that wouldn't be good from a consumer point of view of course.
[CBS is not compromised, how dare you question their integrity!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQYwFND7rHE) 
CBS is just the one caught with its hand in the cookie jar this month, they all do it
I never even heard of it. Can anyone say why I should give a shit?
Yes, and we have a right to read between the lines and call them on it.
But CBS has a responsibility to be editorially independent - including in advertising.  They have a responsibility to do what is best for the people as voters and as consumers.

Why?  Because they are granted the privilege of a broadcasting license.  

They hold a valuable position to be able to control what people see and hear in the media, and the ability to manipulate public opinion and markets.  They can do this because they are granted frequency in a very limited radio spectrum by the government (FCC) on behalf of the people.

Therefore, as a part of the FCC granting use of the spectrum CBS has a responsibility to "best serve the public interest".

Promoting free market competition and remaining editorially independent both best serve the public interest.  If another private company can better serve the public interest by promoting these things, then CBS should have its license revoked and that spectrum reallocated to another provider.

**TL;DR**, CBS is not just a private company that can do what they like, they have a responsibility to do what best serves the public interest because they are given a broadcast license to do so.  This Includes promoting free market competition and remaining editorially independent.
I agree 100%, and I think that there should be no legislative reaction to this action.  HOWEVER, I think that this article and similar information spreading is a good thing as well.
It doesn't really matter how good or bad Soda Stream is.

This is about CBS and their total lack of credibility as a media outlet.  They already destroyed the credibility of [CNET with the CES fiasco.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/ces-tells-cnet-youre-fired/)  They're trying to make a laughing-stock of themselves *again,* by bowing to the big interests.

edit: too sleepy to grammar.
I'll second that. 

Just about anything else is a better flavor additive than their syrups. 

But fizzy water? For that price and convenience? Fucking awesome. 

Mixed alcoholic beverages, mixed with juice, with other 'water enhancers'....just a great product. 
I suppose one could try and match the coke recipe, I would feel disgusted with myself for adding so much sugar though.
You can use tea concentrates to make your own flavoring. Go crazy. Add vitamin C and caffeine too if you like. 
The cola is alright if ingested within an hour. I tried the cherry cola and it tasted like cough syrup. My wife just enjoys carbonated water so we still get some use from it.
Apple spritzer! Yum. 
Actually, I like their root beer and diet cola quite well. Never buy the name brands anymore.
I was trying to save money and bought the diet energy mix to mix with sparkling water from the store.  I tried it first with plain water and it tasted like shitty whiskey flavored cough syrup.
its a machine that allows you to carbonate your own beverages at home and you can buy syrup that mimics popular sodas.
And that's why your country is basically limping around right now with a dying middle class. There is definitely manipulation going on where it applies to the 'free market.' 

Americans are dumb enough to root for the giant corporations, even as they get crushed by them. They're still waving the corporate flag as they take their last breaths. So brave and so stupid. 

If America had much of anything right, that would be reflected in its people. As it stands, you have 50 million people who have absolutely no health care with medical expenses the main cause of bankruptcy. You've got the **FIFTH** most unequal wealth distribution in the *entire* world, you've got the lowest number of middle class since the Great Depression and you are dumb enough to only elect those who protect the interests of corporations and the very wealthy and ignore the interests of the poor and dwindling middle class.

Yep, you got it right as a nation, alright. America: Fuck yeah. You're not experiencing a social or economic crisis or anything. 

Keep doing everything *exactly* the same. I mean, more of all this corporation worship by the sycophants of the class that can barely keep its head above water is *just* what America needs.

PRIVATE ~~COMPANIES~~ CORPORATIONS DESTROYING ANYONE WHO DARES TRY TO GET A PIECE OF THE AVAILABLE MARKET. That's what our forefathers fought and died for! Make no mistake.
Soda is hardly a healthy drink.  And this product has been around since 1903, it's not novel or innovative.
Because while it makes sense for the business in question- hence why they do it- it's not necessary a good thing for the market as a whole.  Remember, our economic system only works well if there is a high amount of equity to allow people to compete.  By allowing "exclusivity" like this, it is allowing pre-established businesses an edge based not on it's market efficiency, but rather the fact that it came first, which doesn't really mean much.  Equity in the marketplace is reduced, so in the end, the economy looses out.

Everyone having a fair shot of competing is necessary for economy and economic growth.  Allowing the markets to petrify themselves for their gain is bad.

EDIT: Apparently SodaStream is an old company, and does some messed up things themselves.  While what CBS did is still wrong, I don't really pity SodaStream anymore.


Not in a country designed to protect the wealthy and punish the poor. It's all part of the pretend free market everyone talks about. You can break into the 'market' but you're not 'free' to compete with giants who can crush you by throwing their money and weight around.
Alright, this needs to be seen by somebody that can tell me if this is true or not. Upvote. 
tl;dr: Their main production facility is on Israeli-claimed Palestinian land, they pay above standard wages, they employ people of many nationalities, Israeli environmental law doesn't apply in occupied territories, and they've received certifications from certifying organizations. 
Here's a [third party adapter](http://sodaco2.com/Home.html)
...Hm, but would Soda Stream let them?
Was that seriously part of the show?

Its a two minute commercial break within a tv show.  Showing off a product for a few seconds is good and all but when you start putting 2 minute commercials within a show that's just wrong.  Don't we get enough commercials during the show?  And they wonder why people love dvrs so much.   
I'm surprised any of the others actually reported this story. Maybe because all the small independent tech blogs and podcasters like TWiT network already broke the story they had no choice?
Do you ever drink fizzy water? If no, you won't ever give a shit. If yes, you might care. 

It's a home carbonation system. You get a CO2 tank and some bottles, fill the bottles with water, and then carb them yourself. You can then add whatever you want to the carbonated water. It's essentially club soda, but add a soda syrup and it's soda. 

The beauty is that after the initial outlay, it's extraordinarily inexpensive. On the order of $0.20 per liter. 

So like I said, if you don't ever drink fizzy water, you won't care. If you drink a lot of it, and aren't totally tied to pure coke/pepsi, you might care a great deal. Personally, we use it as club soda, and mix it with juice and other things. Not as a replacement for coke. But that has driven our coke drinking down, as we now have more interesting (and healthy) stuff to drink. 
So would you feel the same way if a local CBS station rejected Applebees from advertising on their television network because they already have a financially beneficial relationship in place with a local "Mom and Pop" restaurant ... and they don't want to hurt that small company, or their relationship with them?

Gin. Gin and a soda stream together would make a fantastic RomCom. 
Tastes good and cures scurvy!
When I bought it I got the sampler pack I couldn't stomach any of them. But if you have a juicer you can make some amazingly healthy fizzy drinks!
That's a big rant for a story about CBS not trying to lose two of their biggest sponsors over a small company like Sodastream.
You think Americans don't know that our culture and political process is fucked up? You need to surf Reddit more.
We'd better amend the constitution to state that every company is entitled to have their marketing materials distributed without interruption.

> that's why... dying middle class

What are you, Glenn Beck with this over the moon nonsense?
Yeah.. This is not what is ruining America. 
Not me... 
Wonder what your country would have to do for the rest of the world to know stats like that about it.

You can carbonate fruit juice as opposed to "soda". The generic product has been around since forever but an easy, affordable product with enough capital to be mass marketed against bottled sodas apparently has not been around that long.
Lets look at it from CBS's perspective.

Coca Cola and Pepsi contribute (I assume) millions upon millions of dollars in revenue to CBS for advertising. Why would CBS risk damaging a relationship with a company that makes up a huge percentage of their advertising revenue in order to work with a company that can't match their financial compensation?

I've never seen a Sodastream commercial on TV before, but I see Coke and Pepsi advertisements everyday. To possibly piss off Coke and Pepsi to the point where they spend less and/or bring their advertising dollars elsewhere would be bad business on CBS's part.

I understand your argument for "a fair shot at competing", but unfortunately it's not a logical argument to make. It doesn't make sense from a financial perspective on CBS's part to allow Sodastream to advertise. This is strictly a business decision.

I'll pose a question to you that I posed to someone else about this :

Say a local newspaper had a wonderful business relationship with a local Mom and Pop restaurant. That restaurant makes up for a solid portion of the advertising budget of the newspaper.

Lets say an Applebees moved into town and the newspaper didn't allow Applebees to advertise because they know the advertisement would not only damage the relationship they have with the Mom and Pop, but it would also negatively effect that restaurant's financial situation. They want to stand by their loyal customer, because that customer continuously contributes advertising dollars to them.

Would you feel the same? Would you bash that newspaper for standing by their long time customer instead of letting a new competitor to come in or would you preach "fair marketplace" and say they should allow Applebees to advertise?

I personally feel, if this were flip flopped, and CBS catered to a small company over a big one, the anger and ire about this would not be present. I actually feel like CBS would be applauded for their stance by the Reddit community.
Because you think someone has faked the video?  The news of this unsettling fact is all across the Internet.
and, they engage in war crimes.
My guess is yes, Pepsi and Coke should be able to throw enough money at Soda Stream to make it worth while. If SS wants to much, Pepsi or Coke find/create a similar product. 
yeah there's some really blatant product placement/advertising in that show.

here's another from that show.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfHuZ5qrYX4
Hardly ever. I mostly drink flat water, chocolate milk and milk tea (not all at the same time).

But regardless, why should I give a shit if one product is not being advertised on one network? Do companies have a right to advertise their products to every person in the nation?
"promoting free market competition".

Please read the comment.
Yeah, why should I give a fuck whether or not I'm getting all the ads from every company on Earth? 


> editorially independent -  in advertising. 

I've never even heard of that. Is this just your personal declaration, demanding that the people must be informed about any business that wants to reach us? WTF?
Whiskey isn't half-bad either. 
It brought gramps back to life! Sure shootin'!
cool suggestion. I wil have to try and experiment a bit.
Lose what? Like Coke and Pepsi would stop advertising on CBS. They are basically just advertising companies, financing the ads by selling overpriced sugar water.

Coke and Pepsi’s biggest competition is with each other, but you don’t see either threatening to pull advertising because the other’s ads are carried, too. They are acting like a cartel protecting their shared market from disruption. This is bullshit and CBS playing ball is bullshit, too.
Hate?
You completely misunderstood my post.  I admitted that it makes sense for CBS.  What I was arguing is that it's a bad thing for society as a whole.  The responsible thing *would* be for CBS to treat **all** customers equally since advertising it vital to the marketplace, and for Pepsi and Coke-a-cola to accept that.  But, that's not in their best interest.
Well, apparently SS used to have sunkist.  They've just never been too popular.
>"promoting free market competition".

>Please read the comment.

Free market allows CBS to choose who they do business with, because they are free to do business with whomever they choose. The fact that they own frequency spectrum does not limit those freedoms.
[deleted]
No I'm saying the opposite of that 
I use DaVinci or Torani syrups, as well as those Mio things. I only buy their diet cola syrup, for the most part. Plus, you can buy adapters so you are no longer locked into their CO2 tanks, which are a rip off. To be sure... haven't bought diet Pepsi.... I do love my Sodastream...
>Coke and Pepsi’s biggest competition is with each other, but you don’t see either threatening to pull advertising because the other’s ads are carried, too.  
  
Of course Coke isn't threatening to pull out because of Pepsi, Pepsi has power, big bucks, and would just increase market share if Coke left the airwaves.  Sodastream isn't worth much to CBS and rejecting their Super Bowl ad dollars is nothing compared to the loss in advertising dollars from Coke and Pepsi.  
  
I doubt Coke and Pepsi would even care about Sodastream if they hadn't used their trucks and product in the commercial.
Maybe next election cycle they refuse to air Democratic candidates' ads.  FREEDOM OR SOVNGARD!
Just because they *can*, doesn't mean they *should*.

As a broadcaster using limited spectrum granted to them by the government, they have greater responsibility and accountability to the public.

If they choose to ignore that responsibility, ultimately the FCC could intervene or simply not renew their license.

Just because it isn't illegal, doesn't mean it is ethical.
I know, the "yeah" was in agreement with you. The questions were directed at free_to_try (whom I quoted).
Advertising for companies and candidates is different. I am referring to companies doing business with other companies.
[deleted]
Oh my bad, for some reason I thought you were being sarcastic. 
Licensing comes with ethical responsibilities.

The FCC licenses commercial companies to use broadcast spectrum "based on what best serves the public interest".  Because the broadcast spectrum for TV is a limited public resource.

Therefore in order to hold onto their licenses, broadcasters have a responsibility to serve the public interest.  This includes acting as the fourth estate (maintaining editorial independence in news, current affairs and other programming), as well as editorial independence in advertising to promote competition in the free market.

It is an ethical responsibility, although there is no specific legislation saying they cannot refuse a commercial.

But if they continue to show a repeated pattern of bias (which is always against the public interest whether politically or commercially), then the FCC can simply decide that another company might better serve the public interest with the use of that spectrum and simply license it so someone else.

So while it is unlikely to happen, they don't need to break a law in order to lose their license or for the FCC to intervene with warnings etc.  They just need to be seen to not serving the public interest.
free_to_try is right to a point.

The FCC licencing requires a lot of very specific rules and content be broadcast by anyone using the public air waves.

For example, any over-the-air station is required to broadcast a few hours of "educational children's programming" a day.  The rules however do not specify what is educational or what time of day this broadcast happens, so most stations run ULTRA shitty (ie. cheap) cartoons in the dead of night around 1am-4am abouts.  No child ever sees them and it is a total waste of time and resources, but them's the rules.

TV stations have to keep insanely detailed logs of commercials, and have to justify why one commercial is over played compared to another.  This is particularly important in regard to political adds.  Promotional adds for the TV station itself are included in this.  "TONIGHT AT 10....."


Source:  I produced topical promotional adds for a TV station for 2 years.
"In other news, Pepsi sales go up as people buy in large quantities more at 9."
That's not effective "mocking" if they're buying the product the ad told them to. 
Police should respond by firing rubber bullets at protestors.

Pepsi Challenge, Saudi Arabian style 
An interesting test for the devotion of ISIS members:  "Accidentally" airdrop a pallet of booze near one of their strongholds and see what happens.  I'd bet you'd start a fight among members because some would partake regardless of their tenants.
Why would you go through all that trouble for a Heineken?
Reminds me of when USSR officers requested Coca-cola disguise itself using a clear formula so they could drink bold capitalist flavor without being sent to the gulag.

Ladies, gentleman - I was there.  I drank it when it came out and there were two types.  I was one of the first to try the one that was citrus-like.  Had a horrid after taste.
But what about Crystal Gravy?
Ah the clear drinks of the 90s. Hopefully Zima returns as well.
It was fucking horrendous the first time...
I was only seven, but I loved the stuff.*

^^*Until ^^they ^^reformulated ^^as ^^Crystal ^^by ^^Pepsi ^^and ^^made ^^it ^^taste ^^like ^^sour ^^oranges. 
Uhhh, Can someone tell me what exactly crystal pepsi was or tasted like?  

Im australian and as far as I know we never actually got it, but I thought it was just clear pepsi, but everyone seems to be saying it tastes terrible
I remember liking it.

I was also somewhere around 8 and thought the McBLT was gourmet food, so it's not like I had standards back then.

I saw a clear Mountain Dew display last week. It's name was a play on words relating it to moonshine. By the way, Mountain Dew was created as a mixer for Moonshine, if my memory serves me right.
Thus proving there's no 80s or 90s fad which can't make a comeback?

Maybe this time around we'll also get [Soylent Clear!](https://youtu.be/nSd_m41GK3A)
What about the Holiday Spice Pepsi?  My wife said that it tasted too similar to Coke, which is probably why I liked it.
It's 2015...isn't there supposed to be Pepsi Perfect by now?
Let me know when the clear snapple tru root beer comes back. I loved that stuff
I liked the liquid plastic taste.  Especially when super high.
Oh God why? That shit was nasty and I still remember the jokes about it.

i loved zima when i was younger. we would mix it with pucker.
Hmmm I don't remember that actually. Was that done in the u.s.?
The original crystal was like a cola and the other was a nasty citrus drink that had a horrible after taste.
Mc what L what?  

Why is this not a thing now?  
You mean the McDLT. For those who don't know, it was like a Whopper from Burger King but in a [novel package.](http://i.imgur.com/fqDteUO.jpg) The bottom bun and meat would go in one side, while the top bun and vegetables would go on another. The consumer finishes the assembly just before eating so the lettuce doesn't wilt and the tomato doesn't get too hot, etc
Damnit. You beat me to it. 
Tried this a few weeks back as I enjoy trying new/different soft drinks.  Basically tasted like a Sprite or 7up.
It supposedly was a moonshine originally. 
was that carbonated? i dont remember it.
the la beast had the best drinking session with crystal pepsi.
or the guacamole ones. i miss those.
Yeah. This is the [original version.](http://i.imgur.com/4ixAT4a.jpg) It tasted more or less like a normal cola, but not 100% the same as Pepsi. Now here's ["New Citrus Taste!"](http://i.imgur.com/curi7xc.jpg) They changed to citrus to meet people's expectation for clear sodas. I'm not sure whether they were trying to make it taste like oranges or tangerines or what kind of citrus fruit, but it was just [god awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0kVbXvId3A).

[Comparison picture.](http://i.imgur.com/5JsMj1M.jpg)
Oh, so one really was just pepsi with no color, and another tasted like soda fucked a lemon.  
Alright then
It didn't taste like Pepsi though. It was a different cola taste.
The original was different than Pepsi, but still obviously a cola instead of citrus-flavored. The Citrus one tasted like soda fucked a bag of rotten oranges, not lemon.
Well I'm shocked to hear that. Shocked I say.

Hello, top-voted comment that is 100% misinformation.

That mechanism is for discriminatory policies, such as if Montreal decided to ban only foreign or out-of-province produced plastic water bottles.
This is about bottled water i.e. Dasani and Aquafina not CocaCola and Pepsi.
Can we just please collectively shit on a draconian policy without having to be finger-wagged at that we have it somewhat wrong?
Thanks for clarifying details of a secret deal that citizens haven't been allowed to see. Maybe if it were up for public debate I would have my facts straight, as opposed to relying on Wikileaks and espionage to find out what the New World Order has in store for us plebes.
Its all bullshit. Marlboro successfully sued Uruguay for implementing large health warnings on ALL cigarette packages by arguing that it was somehow a discriminatory action. WTO sided with Marlboro. The TPP will go even further.
You're kidding, right? The text of the deal has been available for months. It still hasn't been passed by the Senate.

But yeah, keep screaming about the secret trade deal that nobody knows the details of that is being crammed down our throats before we know what happened.
Obviously that's bullshit, but you said it yourself: it already happens under existing trade deals.

The TPP doesn't go further, you have nothing to back that up. This is a standard feature in trade deals that only recently has become controversial, because OMG CORPORATIONS.
When I was a little kid, I was eating pancakes and asked my mom who Aunt Jemima was and why her picture was on the syrup bottle. I'll never forget her answer. She said,  "Aunt Jemima was a nanny to some kids a long time ago. She took care of them all day, every day, and after a while they started calling her Mama, and so she had to tell them, 'I ain't ya Mama!' So after that they started calling her Aunt Jemima."

Of course it does since that's so common its not even worth a write up.  But I'm sure someone at that paper is anti-soda and latched on to that one fact to forward their agenda.
Seriously. A liter of vodka a day, and they focus on the Pepsi?

Now I need to look up what can had what amount I got the felling that there is a soda can that got way to mush sodium then what's healthy.
Soda made from the tears of clubbed seals?
Oh I know, you're still a pig. :-)
Club soda is flavored, carbonated water; aka "soda". It just isn't as sweet or as flavorful as most other sodas.

Rock n roll, cola wars, I cant take it anymore!
I hope that this factory thrives. 

The Pepsi factory was 'off limits' to attacks by Hamas because Arafat was an investor. Not sure if the Coke factory will be treated the same.

Hamas has a history of doing things to make Gazans more miserable. Example: "Crazy Water"; a very popular water park http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_the_Gaza_Strip#Water_park
Share a Coke with Abdullah.
That's only in America we don't know to enjoy, instead we over indulge. I doubt they'll have that problem. Also they aren't going to be using corn syrup as the sweetener (also american) they'll use real sugar like everyone else.
I always took that lyric as, "Rock and Roller Color Wars", referencing the Bloods vs Crips. 
Everything Hamas does has the intention of making Gaza is a shitty place. Like Boko Haram or ISIS they are pure evil, and they have never served the well-being of the common Palestinian.
The effects of high fructose corn syrup on the human body are the same as sucrose. 

Period. Full stop. End of story.

HFCS comes in different sweetness levels. A level lower than that of sugar is less sweet than sugar, a level that is higher is more sweet. 

If you get a batch that has the same sweetness as an arbitrary solution of sugar and you taste the HFCS and the solution of sugar, they will taste exactly the same.

Not only that, but there is no evidence that anyone is tasting anything better in "Mexicoke" other than the glass of the bottle and the psychological effects of seeking out, finding, and consuming a rare product.

http://sciencejon.blogspot.com/2012/10/does-real-sugar-make-mexican-coke-taste.html

An actual chemical analysis of "real sugar" Coke found that the "real sugar" in Coke was actually a chemical very close in composition to HFCS and that may be due to either a chemical reaction after bottling or simple mislabeling.

>For Coca-Cola, the fructose-to-glucose ratio varied from 58:42 to 65:35 for the three United States samples. The Mexican Coca-Cola sample had a fructose-to- glucose ratio of 52:48. 

[Sugar Content of Popular Sweetened Beverages Based on Objective Laboratory Analysis: Focus on Fructose Content](http://goranlab.com/pdf/Ventura%20Obesity%202010-sugary%20beverages.pdf)

>[Much of the confusion about high-fructose corn syrup stems from a 2004 article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that suggested rising obesity rates were related to increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages.](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/in-worries-about-sweeteners-think-of-all-sugars/) The lead author, Dr. George A. Bray, said in an interview last week that the real issue highlighted in the report was overconsumption of all sugary beverages, but that the article has been distorted as an indictment of high-fructose corn syrup alone. Dr. Bray notes that the fructose absorbed from large quantities of regular sugar and from high-fructose corn syrup is equally harmful. “Sugar is sugar,” said Dr. Bray, professor of medicine at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.

The problem with sugar is too much of it-- not what kind it is-- unless you know more than Dr. Bray, of course.

But hipsters gonna hip...

its "rock and dont monetize whores"
You're not wrong, but research (yeah, I'm too lazy to google) that I've recently read from some pretty decent primary sources seems to be differing a little.  I won't get into that though.

I will say that the problem with HFCS is that it's overrused everywhere.  It's overrused everywhere because it's more or less free.  It's more or less free because the government subsidizes corn production to absurd levels.

HFCS is in shit it has absolutely no place being in, and that's the big problem.  It being in your Coke?  Who cares.  Functionally equivalent to sucrose.  It being in nearly every processed food you eat?  Yeah.  That's a problem.

It would be interesting to see if cane sugar would have slowly entered every single product on the market like HCFS did, if there were no farm subsidies or protectionist laws in place.
>It being in nearly every processed food you eat?  Yeah.  That's a problem.

That's the problem! Why the hell are they putting sugar in ketchup?!? You have to pay a premium for ketchup with fewer things in it. 

Maybe that's due to subsidies making HFCS super cheap (cheaper than tomatoes?) and the move towards sweetening everything?

It's ridiculous but whether or not the sugar is cane sugar or HFCS it's bad. 
I'm starting to think Pepsi's marketing team is more clever than I initially gave them credit for. 
They were dispensing Pepsi in a slightly different way down in Portland.

I love Toblerone, but that is r/assholedesign right there.
I was so disappointed when they changed to the gap tooth design.  Back in the early 1970's when inflation was running rampant and the price of chocolate and sugar were rising dramatically, candy manufactures attempted to keep the price at 10 cents by decreasing the size of the candy bars. It wasn't long before they were so tiny that people became dissatisfied and the brands were losing their good reputation.   The candy companies were scared to change the prices because 10 cents was iconic.  I don't remember which candy company changed first, but they increased the bar to its prior size and all the other manufactures followed.  

I don't think Tobleron learned the lesson from years ago that customers would rather have a sufficient amount rather than a low price.
Good. Raise the price or make them smaller if necessary. The weird redesign was just disappointing. 
My buddy once received four 750g tolberones as gifts. He forgot about them and left them in his car on a sunny Texas day and they melted. 

When he retrieved them, the chocolate could be heard gooping inside the box.

Not wanting to be defeated by the Sun, he put the boxes into the fridge and waited. When they finally solidified, he removed them from the boxes and revealed four chocolate 5th Element stones. 
[removed]
You know what, Helena? You don’t deserve this big Toblerone.
That bar screams "We have cheapened the product", like the no-longer half gallon ice cream containers.
I used to pack Tolber when I was climbing. Always had a bar in the pack just in case. Now it's a bar of air. I don't need empty filler in my survival rations, I need calories. 
I never actually saw those, so i thought they never went through with the design.
We deserve this Toblerone.

But seriously who would even eat that "New" version, it's so spaced out it looks unappetizing. Like that's like 75% air, you can more food content in a bag of chips.
The greatest victory ever.
I wonder if their big sales after the 2016 change that they're bragging about were people only buying the  one to see what the fuss over the new shape was 
This makes me so happy! And probably fat.. but fat and happy!
So serious question.  Was this design change only in non-US markets?  I've seen people complaining about this change for quite a while, but I've bought probably a half dozen Toblerones in the last 4 months and not seen this design.  Is my grocer just selling me really old candy?
Good. WTF was that last thing???
Slow news day?
Now let's get Jaffa Cakes back to 12 per packet instead of 10.
Stop making things smaller or less, just raise the price. People that want to eat it will pay for it
The most identifiable thing about Toblerone was its triangle shape...and they changed that to save money and gave customers a smaller, strange shaped chocolate bar.  That just seems like a bad idea
Ha. Good.

But I still will not buy their product for some time for pulling that shenanigan. I want an apology and a free triangle give away promotion.
I used to buy these things several dozen at a crack for hiking/cycling food and for stocking stuffers at Christmas.

I'm used to food companies "downsizing" their products and keeping the price the same, making it hard for consumers to realize they are getting shafted.

No more.

Last year, I went to the Brown-Haley store in Tacoma to bur directly. Great value. https://www.brown-haley.com/collections/wholesale-cases-and-bulk-1
I know that this was about weight and all but **I actually like this design**. It seems like it would make breaking a bar apart much easier and the #1 reason I don't buy Toblerone is because you either get your fingers all sticky trying to take it apart or hurt your gums when taking a bite.
So, less candy, more money basically.  
I don't even eat them an I appreciated how the original design broke pieces easily...  the change was as dumb as the IHOB idea that got backpedaled...
New Coke? I never would have bought a toblerone before but now I kind of want one. 
What is this madness. My mind is melting.
How did I get this long triangle? 
Another “New Coke” getting way too much media attention.
TIL 2 things about Scott Blackadder: 1 - he thinks he's funny;  2 - he's not funny 
Oh no, that's the perfect long-term answer for their customers. Once they give that answer they'll stop having customers, meaning the problem of how to go out of business is solved for good.
Good it is too fucking hard to chew
Truly the important news.
Will it revert to its original shape after I've eaten 3/4 of it?  That would be great.
Slow news day?
Never a fan of either taste or shape.  Strange thing.

back to the real news
How is this news? Like, really?  What's next? Frito Lay will add more air to their chip bags?  Whole Foods will rearrange the fruit section?  Wendy's will switch to bowls for frosties?



Edit:  Downvoted by Hail Corporate.
I agree, but I had a small feeling they New Coke'd it. They purposefully made a shitty Toblerone bar, took the enormous flak then switched back to increase sales overall.
I've never even seen one in the new shape, and I have toblerone probably a couple times month and travel a lot. 
[For almost 75 years, Coca-Cola only cost 5¢. The price became married to the brand but eventually inflation caught up and Coke was forced to raise their prices. They actually lobbied the US Treasury Department to mint a 7.5¢ coin so that customers could continue to pay with a single coin without Coke needing to double their prices.](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/11/15/165143816/why-coke-cost-a-nickel-for-70-years)
I feel like a shorter toblerone bar, or a price increase would have been WAY less noticeable than the iconic shape changing.
Candy companies have kept on doing that.  They just do it very slowly over time so most of the customers don't notice.  
.10 cents is a tenth of a penny. I do remember ten cent candy bars though
[Phyletic size decrease in Hershey Bars](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WXalU04X6coC&pg=PA297&lpg=PA297&dq=stephen+jay+gould+chocolate+bars&source=bl&ots=fhmj9TEXIC&sig=8xwv6NvwZXAsSVgNRZpwBli0mLU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8nfHxnLHcAhUJy7wKHR8FAxsQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=stephen%20jay%20gould%20chocolate%20bars&f=false)
Just raise the price, OK? I'm extremely sick with having to find new brands all the time because the makers would do *anything* not to adjust the prize. Which usually means that the ingredients get cheaper all the time and the product becomes shit, and you have to switch to "premium" alternatives to get that which used to be the normal thing. It's a damn neverending cycle.
"Korben my man, I have no fire!" 😬
I legitimately want a second season. 
Also the air is thinner at altitude so you're getting double ripped off.
But what if you get stuck in a cave or something where you don't have air while also being hungry?  Bet you'd wish you had a half air half chocolate bar then. 
Think of the weight savings, though! 
Is there fear that you get a rush from overcoming, or are you just not afraid of heights at all?
Not non-US either, we didn’t see this design in Northern Europe. I think it was Britain and France. 
What are you talking about? This is the most important to think to happen in months!

Pinch the points together. With a large gap it is more difficult.
Also it is a boring candy it’s just chocolate 
It’s chocolate. Not candy. Candy is colorful, not brown.
THe IHOB thing was a marketing stunt, they never intended for that to be the permanent name. They just wanted more people to come to their restaurants later in the day.
I guess they are saying it was all a joke so you'd know they have hamburgers.

Who knows.
IHOB was genius. Go get their burgers yum
Had a buddy tell me it was the best chocolate he ever tried. I bought it from a dollar store. Took a bite and threw it away. I wonder if his comparison was Hershey and Willy Wonka - because then, it might be considered decent... barely. 
[deleted]
If one doesn't follow the news, how would consumers know they switched it back? For all they know, they think it would be the same crappy bar. Might backfire on Toblerone.
I remember buying soda for a quarter back in the 90s.  I'm kind of surprised that soda companies haven't tried to push dollar coins harder.
Oh man, the arrogance to even *ask* the United States government to mint coins, with a fraction no less, just so you don't have to eat the marketing hit. 
I was there for the end of nickel Coke in the old small glass bottles..
So in the 40s and 50s most Coke bottles were 5 cents, as they had been for 70 plus years. Now here we are in 2018, 70 or so years later and it's increased almost 3000% to $1.49 for a glass bottle. Where did it all go so wrong...
And let’s not forget the “New Coke” debacle in the 80s. People were so happy when they went went back to the “old” formula (rebranded as Coke Classic) they didn’t notice that sugar had been replaced with high fructose corn syrup
It's crazy that back in the day these companies would do whatever they could to not raise prices. Now they do whatever they can to raise prices 
For sure.  The gaps scream of something lost.
We are discussing chocolate and you worry about a decimal point?  Chocolate is so much more important but I do agree with you so I corrected my typo.
[deleted]
I think you may have pasted an incorrect link. 
No fucking kidding. Even ten years ago, i could tell Hershey's Chocolate was getting really fucking shitty. Now I either buy premium chocolate from a local shop, or I get Ghirardelli.
Tell us your story. I want to hear about the long and windy road candy has taken led you down.
Fucking cans of tuna, man. They used to be bigger. Tuna Helper had to change their recipes to account for it.
Yeah, I'm tired of buying double stuff Oreos just to get the same amount of cream as normal Oreos are *supposed* to have. It's almost enough to get me to buy Hydrox. Almost.
Breyer’s, when Unilever took over, pulled that shit and I’ve never forgiven them 
Have you tasted American coke, the sugary version? It tastes horrible because it doesn’t actually use sugar at all, but corn syrup or something. 
Multi pass. 
i remember on my first visit to colorado, i was so excited when my bottle of pancake mix had special cooking instructions for high altitudes on the back

I actually backed out of this thread, went to the front page, and then had to come back just to upvote you. 
Saw it in Canada
You know what? I take it back.

Let's keep the good news coming in.
I’m getting my highlights put in right now, but when this is done he’s fucking toast.
You must be that guy that puts 5 star reviews on defective products because you're just happy you got SOMETHING.
no its not its got bits in it, little almond and like toffee or something
It's all called candy here.
As a swiss guy I really don‘t know why Toblerone is so popular, we have so many types of chocolate that are better than Toblerone.
Yeah, anytime some company pisses off their customers, it's "their product was shitty". /s
150g vs 200g is a good clue.
haha well its just my little conspiracy theory, probably has a few holes in the logic
During my time in high school, feom 2005-2008, the boys locker room had a vending machine that had been there since the 70s. Sodas cost $0.25. We would give guys $0.50 to get us a soda, they keep the extra quarter. It was really cool. Unfortunately some parents found out about it and made the school remove it because soda is unhealthy. They replaced it with a machine that would give you a bottle of water for $3.
I hate carrying coins. They're heavy, noisy and spill out of your pockets when you get into vehicles.
[removed]
Canada has a dollar coin. It’s wonderful
Walmarts vending machines have coke and pepsi products for .50. Dr. Pepper isn’t coke or pepsi but it’s still included in the pepsi machine. 
Soda was a 25 cents for a 12 ounce can in the late seventies and rose quickly throughout the 80's.  In 1979 I remember one machine down at the armory that had soda for a quarter whereas everyone else was at 30 cents.  It wasn't as convenient going from one coin purchase to having and getting odd change back for the 30 cents.  
They did briefly in the early 00s. A lot of the coin-only machines advertised that they accepted the new Sacagawea. But it flopped. It didn’t help that it was the same size as a quarter
In Norway we have coins up to a value of roughly 3.5$ US. I remember Coca Cola stalled for years about raising their prices to about $4, as you would then need to use a much rare 5 kroner coin in addition to the old 20 kroner coin. 
When I was in driver's ed (somewhere around '97), a can of Squirt was a quarter - but I only remember this because the other drinks cost something like 50 cents.
Card readers work way better.
Lol speak for your own country, dollar coins exist lots of places.
The crazy thing is, it worked. I have a few 7.5 cent coins
Were you old enough to appreciate that an end of an era was coming?  In other words, did people complain a lot?  And man, were those bottles small.  I've only seen them as collector items but considering how large soda servings are today, they seem like toy bottles for the kid sister's dolly.
The fact that Coke cost 5 cents for 70 years is the weird thing, not that it went from 5 cents to $1.50 since then.
1.49/0.05 over 70 years is 4.9% annual
In Norway it is about 4 US dollars for a plastic bottle...
And plenty of people drink diet Coke, which is very close to the flavor of new Coke.
Companies still expend monumental amounts of effort to keep prices low. 
Pet peeves will be pet peeves ;)
...no it's not. You can say either 10 cents or $0.10.
It links to the first few pages of the article, seems okay to me.
Hershey's has a weird...vomity taste now.  
I think that was just you getting older
Just look at ice cream.  

Ice cream used to be just a few ingredients: Milk, cream, eggs, and some flavor ingredient like vanilla or chocolate.  

Now it's all mostly fillers like carrageenan or guar gum, then it is whipped so that it is half air, and the rest is something like soybean oil.    

The stuff is now so far from ice cream that it often [won't even melt](https://youtube.com/watch?v=i6aUOJIfazI) 

The long and winding road

That leads to Toblerone

The big peaks disappeared

I miss that bar before

I'm always hungry here

Leaves me wanting more

But I think they have less cookie. Ratio is all off on Oreos compared to what it used to be. You either get more cream (which I really dislike), or two dry cookies. Reese's Cups did the same thing and shrinked them all, ruining my favorite sweets from Grandma's house. Now I have to settle for Nutter Butters and Werthers Originals.
Im sick of having to eat oreos to fill the void left in my heart by the extinction of dunkaroos :(
I too like little events like this.

Almonds and honey nougat, it's great.
They marketed heavily in airports, so the brand gained a sophisticated international traveler reputation and it was seen as a classy gift back in the 90s/00s.  Toblerone was the chocolate for rich people who took foreign vacations, but it was cheap enough that anybody passing through an airport duty-free shop could afford a big bar.  Even now, something like 25% of Toblerone bars are sold in airports.
It's the same as Hershey in America. You eat it as a kid and you don't have a refined pallete at that age, so it tastes amazing. You then carry that memory into your adulthood and always associate the taste with how it made you feel as a kid.
I agree. There are so many amazing Swiss bars and they are killing it when it cones to taste. 
God that's depressing. I hate when parents hear stories like that and don't think they're dope, and instead have to ruin it.
Our school took the pop machines out and replaced them with water and milk. 

They threw away alot of spoiled milk that first year. 
[deleted]
It's unforgivable that a school wouldn't have a water fountain available for gym students.
My school did this but instead replaced the soda machines with expensive high calorie milk products.
Would you say they're coarse, irritating and get everywhere?
The store brand soda machines outside of Walmart were 25 cents. I remember convenience stores selling 20 ounce bottles for a dollar, but two liters were 69 cents.
The US has about 16 dollar coins.  But they always fall into obscurity because nobody uses them or they get bought up by collectors and stashed in people's attics.
certainly made coin-op arcades go extinct faster
Dr pepper is both coke and pepsi and neither at the same time. Dr pepper contracts both of them for distribution.
I don't think I implied that I was speaking for any other country, given the context of the post I was responding to?
I'm not finding any proof that there was ever a single run of such coins.

[Obsolete coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_United_States_dollar#Obsolete_coins)
I was in 4th or 5th grade and my parents gave me the change I would need for snack time, so it didn't make much difference to me when it went up to a dime.
Planet Money did a whole episode on this. I think the issue had to do with the tooling of the machines. 

EDIT: boy did I misremember this. Had to do with a bad contract they signed and the ad campaign they undertook to cover that blunder. https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/28/597302023/the-price-of-coke-stayed-the-same-for-70-years-why
Or you can say 0.10 cents cause people will figure out what you mean unless you're writing a contract or writing a computer program

.10 cents is the same as 10 cents. Yes I see the little dot but .10 is stylized to drive home the fact that it is 10 cents.
I’m quite certain that is illegal in my country. 
The only ice cream ive ever had that wouldnt melt was weed ice cream.


Also how the fuck could ice cream have eggs in it? It just isn’t something youd think 
At least they didn't fuck it up as bad as Cadbury fucked up their cream eggs. I still buy them out of tradition, but it just ends up pissing me off.
Dunkaroos are still being made overseas, just order them from Amazon. For a time General mills even ran a campaign encouraging people to smuggle them from Canada, they called it Smugglaroos.
Probably the parents of some overweight kid. They don't want to take responsibility for buttering up their own kid with the meals they serve them on the daily, so blame everything and everybody else.
Water is free at school anyways.
I find it funny that the parents that demand all of these "healthy only" options never bat an eye at the milk option.  It's a fatty dairy.

But God forbid we still offer 7-Up or gatorade, OH NOES.
That is unforgivable.  
I do agree, but I am missing were that was a part of the story,
Thanks for reminding me, I have this sickening urge to rewatch Episodes 2 and 3.

The trick is to eliminate paper dollars as an option.
Actually I lied; I don’t really like using physical money. It’s still nice to have a dollar coin I guess though...our two dollar coin is probably more useful at this point though 
until you buy a train ticket with a 50, then suddenly youre swimming in them
The problem is that they keep cranking out the paper bills as well. They need to start cutting those out. It's more efficient for everyone. 
r/notkenm
Which is the post [that started this conversation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/90p9c8/toblerone_bar_to_revert_to_original_shape/e2sf66o)  I’m only pointing that out because I literally stared typing the same thing as my comment and only realized just before I hit submit that we were already talking about it.
Or you could just say 10 cents, since it's fewer characters, doesn't have another meaning, and is actually correct.
...no, it's not. Using the decimal makes it more confusing (and wrong). Decimals in numbers have meaning. You know what really drives home the fact that it's 10 cents? 10 cents. There's no confusion there. 10 is a different number from .10. The poster above simply made a mistake and accidentally combined the "10 cents" formatting with "$0.10". Not a big deal, but I don't know why you're trying to argue it's correct. Using your logic, .1 cents and .10 cents are different amounts, which makes...no sense.

I, too, like to get angry at fat people that I've imagined.
If you know where the GOOD water fountain is. 
Milk is the breast lactation of a new mother cow. Sort of weird if ya think about it. I wouldn’t drink human breast milk, not sure why I drink cow breast milk. 
Or a Loonie in Canadia. 
The trick is to just use a card or smartphone.
And run an economy on metals? You can't print gold though
We have $2 bills. But using them may get the cops called on you.
Its also hard for cashiers to give them out. They need to phase out the penny at the same time
The angry pedant. I agree with you completely of course, I'm just not as passionate.
Anyone want a nice scoop of ice milk? (Though I guess in the US it's called "low fat ice cream")
And where'd I do that?
But Wendell literally deepthroats the spout everytime he takes a drink
Well the comparison was that it's healthier than pop, which it definitely  is
I never got the cellphone thing.  It feels too.... hipster.

I set it up on my phone but it's one of those things where I'm just not going to stick my phone out my car window, or wave it around a machine that may or may not register it and then I have to end up digging out my card anyway.  And everyone's standing around staring at me while I tap at it like an idiot.

That and I'm highly suspicious of the crackability of the tech.
Which means retailers have to charge 3-5% more because of transaction fees. I hate that there's not a centralized public option for electronic payments. 
Naw cash is faster and better
Plastic is a thing too.
I'd honestly laugh at the prospect of having the cops called.  I would relish the "God, you're such a dumbshit, didn't you know this was a real thing?" smart-assery that would soon result.
We HAD $2 bills and they went out of style
A few inches up.
Milk is most certainly healthier than soda.
I had to eat fast food (because reasons) and the swiper at Burger King was acting funny. Pulled out my phone and used Apple Pay and problem was resolved.

> That and I'm highly suspicious of the crackability of the tech.

What issues, specifically, makes you suspicious?

> I set it up on my phone but it's one of those things where I'm just not going to stick my phone out my car window

Uhhh, I have never done that either?

>  or wave it around a machine

You just tape it. Same way as an super short range RFID tag.

> that may or may not register it and then I have to end up digging out my card anyway. 

Uhhh, huh? I've yet to run into that. Neither has anyone I known in person. Maybe my grandparents or my mother would run into that problem.

> And everyone's standing around staring at me while I tap at it like an idiot.

There comes an age when you stop caring about what other people think and worry about getting through your own life. Using Apple Pay is *so* much nicer than using a card. So much so I wish my credit union would support it and I opened an account at Bank of Internet so I could funnel funds there and use it.
Which means they're not paying people as much to tally drawers, to secure cash, to run back and forth from bank to do deposits etc etc. 

Handling cash isn't exactly free for businesses, the transaction fees end up being a wash all things considered. There's a reason cash only places are rapidly vanishing. And it's not like a public option would be magically free, it'd need taxes or fees to operate. 
I'm not using no goddamn pogs as money.

The only people getting angry in that post are the hypothetical parents of overweight kids.
Are you serious? State some sources
https://www.livestrong.com/article/474859-what-are-the-benefits-of-drinking-milk-vs-soda/ because your probably a lazy bitch who drinks pop
The only time I've had an issue was when I stuck a magnet to my phone for my car holder, because I managed to put it right in top of the sensor. Whoops. 
Maybe Apple Pay is better -- I don't use an iPhone, but I've had Samsung phones since "phone pay" became a thing.  

I tried to use it when it was first rolling out and yes, I found it inconvenient.  I don't walk around with my phone in my hand staring into its depths 24-7, so grabbing my card out of my purse was easier than taking my phone out and then unlocking it, or swiping out of top apps.  Not to mention that if I needed to access a rewards card, coupons, or an ID, I would have to take the card out anyway -- and it didn't eliminate the need for me to tote around a wallet (which is why I would want this feature) because card support was extremely spotty.  And Samsung's "convenience" feature -- where the card window stays at the edge of my phone screen -- actually just gets in my way (and if you turn it off, it defeats the purpose of 'quick' payments).

I have personally encountered several non-working terminals, or have been told, "Yeah, I know it says that, but we can't actually accept tap pay." (or some similar form of excuse)

As for the technology -- you compare it with RFID, but as someone who works with computers for a living, I can tell you that RFID is very easy to steal if you can get a reader close enough.  Even though NFC requires the 'tap', it's still basically radiating information for any receiver in range.  Maybe I'm just a suspicious old goat, but we live in a world where people tamper with POS terminals every chance they get.
I own several small businesses and I'm well aware of the costs. I appreciate your line of thinking as well. 

If you're going to the bank with a little or a lot of cash it doesn't make much of a difference, you're still doing it and at a certain point it's worth buying a $200 cash counter. My one and only issue with cash isn't the labor but the possibility of employee theft. The labor would easily pay for itself. I'd have made an extra five digits last year in profit. 

When you're selling something like equipment for several thousands of dollars or you're looking at 75% of your sales being on cards, it hurts to get 3% taken out. Checks also cost money in the line of processing but there's no charge for that other than the actual check book which the payer pays for. So does physical distribution, printing, and destruction of currency. 

The payment for currency comes from the economy and taxes as a whole. If anything I bet there'd be a nice savings for our government. The cost for checks is covered by the way a bank functions in needing the deposit to cover loans. 
Plastic can be turned into thin yet durable sheets.
This isn't mysterious.

Necco is a valuable brand. Their candy and manufacturing capability is not. That's why they failed. But Necco is still recognizable and so, has value. 

A candy company bought Necco and shut down what was at that point a useless factory for them. They'll produce the popular Necco candies at their own, better factories, and slap the brand name on them. Consumers will notice an odd new taste, just barely, and in fifteen years, people will begin telling stories to teenagers about how the candies *used to taste*. Just like they did with twinkies (coincidentally, the guy who bought and sold Necco also saved Twinkies too). 

This is a tale as old as capitalism. 
How am I going to tile the roof of my gingerbread house now?!
I believe Necco Wafers are so old they were included in wartime rations during the US Civil War. If they shut down it will be the end of an era for disgusting heirloom candies leaving multicolored ribbon candy and candy corn as the sole options for people who like to LARP as dock workers from 1901 who are trying to quit smoking.
Not just Necco wafers. The company also made Clark bars and Skybar. Hopefully they will be manufactured again!

Watch till the end to see why I posted this in this specific thread.
Maybe they'll bring back Marathon bars now that Necco wafers are histoire.

On second thought, forget it.  I pay too much for my Novopens as it is, and don't need to be buying 2 or 3 extra every month.
Likely will be sold to Tootsie Roll Industries who has bought up most nostalgia candies and has plenty of production facilities in place of their own. It fits their portfolio, my guess is they didn’t bid in bankruptcy court because they didn’t want to be saddled with the production facility or the prospects of closing or selling it. They’re mainly after brands.
Necco wafers taste like shit, that’s why. 
Good, maybe now I can get the taste of one of those nasty wafers out of my mouth now.
No mystery; their "candy" is made of chalk.
I worked with a guy who once said he worked night construction there while they were renovating. He told me how the old factory was infested with rats that would regularly fall into the vats of boiling syrup for the candy. Could be he was just trying to gross me out, but I never had another Necco wafer again after that just to be safe. I'm interested to see why the factory shut down. !remindme 30 days
What's mysterious? Sounds like they make ginger bread house parts, not candy.
These are the sweethearts people?
Fuck neccos they taste like shit
nothing mysterious, no one bought their candy as it sucked, brand, distribution, and equipment are worth money though.

So it's not my imagination.

Twinkies actually did taste better.
Theres and interesting Planet Money that talks about the guy who reintroduced Hydrox. He could buy the name but not the recipe so he had to reverse engineer them using the ingredient list. He would send test cookies out to Hydrox fans and get feedback to tinker it until he got it as close as he could.
Most of the people who eat necco wafers won't be alive in 15 years. I don't know anyone under the age of 70 who enjoys them
The missing ingredient will probably be the rat or pigeon shit missing in the new factory...
I think it's a good time to buy all the necco candy currently out there and vacuum seal it. 
Jolly good comment
Well son of a bitch. Just yesterday I had an argument with an old guy who swears everything was better when he was a kid. One of my exact statements was “look at twinkies, they’ve been the same forever! I guarantee you twinkies have tasted exactly the same as long as they’ve existed!”

Guess not. 
Save twinkies? I thought he bought it shut to smash the Union amd rehired alot of people back at reduced wages and no pension. Tale as old as capitalism is the worker gets F’ed and the Wall Street bankers get paid!!
I don't know...still sounds chalky to me.
In 15 years, the only generation that still eats Necco wafers won’t be around anymore.

NECCO Wafers are great if you want a candy that isn't overly sweet and if you're looking for that chalky quality. They aren't bad. They're just different.
All of these are amazing compared to these ufo wafers I found when I moved up north. They have little bead like candies inside that are sort of like tasteless nerds. The wafer itself is basically styrofoam
I thought they were still selling WWII inventory. Never liked their candy even though I was fat kid. 
Quick research shows that they are indeed old (1847), but they were included in WWII rations.  No mention of earlier wars there.

This is the case with many snack foods. How else are they keeping the price and the size of the snack mor or less the same over decades, but by using cheaper and less satisfying ingredientes?
Same with McDonald's french fries. While I did get used to the taste, they will never not give me sharts.
Our grocery store recently began selling some sort of retro, classic "beefaroni", which tells me that they went way nasty cheap on it at some point.

Doubtful it'll be that, but basically you're right, the equipment is probably a little in disrepair and that's gonna affect things. 
"Necco" (a.k.a.*Soylent Necro*) is people.
Hostess was gone for like 7 years. Nobody eats Twinkies so it was hard to notice. If you try them now, they taste like tiny gooey despair...
That's a very silly view. The fact is that "poor" people today are entire worlds better off than they were even a hundred years ago. That's because of capitalism. 

And we know that to be the case, because poor people in communist countries are just "normal" and that never changed for the better throughout those nations. It only got worse. Famines, no social progress, no economic progress, nothing.

I was sixteen once too though. I get it. It's just silly now that I'm an adult and aware. 
Socialist BS.
Idk about yours but an assload for me would be too many.  Not that I know how many smarties I can fit in my ass.  2367.
Hey...That's a GREAT idea! Thanks!
It makes sense that there's some demand for less intensely sweet items, but who wants to eat chalk 
Necco wafers were awesome screw the haters. 
So, you're saying NECCO wafers are a great alternative when I feel like eating Tums?
Maybe I'm weird but neccos are one of my favorite candies.

Edit: You calling it chalky made me think about how I also used to love drinking pepto bismol as a kid. I never made the connection until now.
Actually if you get them fresh they are just slightly chewy. I was in a touristy area yesterday after hearing the news. It had one of those massive candy stores so I went in looking for Necco wafers. They had some but they were so hard and stale they might have been from the civil war era... 
Looking for that *paint chip* quality.
> tasteless nerds

So, like most redditors?
I don't think *they* like their candies.
You're thinking of Purple Hearts...very similar but harder to chew.
My civil war veteran uncle must have lied to me.
Dockworkers from 1901 who are trying to quit smoking do not eat rock candy, for obvious reasons, so the LARPers thereof avoid it for authenticities sake
Dusty old bones. Full of green dust.
Oh my god, these chocodiles Hailey, these chocodiles, these chocodiles oh my god
I loved Chocodiles when I was a kid, but I was well into my 20s when I realized I had been pronouncing them wrong. I called them choco-dillies and it never made sense to me why they had an alligator on the package. 
This comment checks out, this kid fats.
False. Chocodiles are Twinkies, just covered in chocolate. 
ya, in WWII
They still sell banana twinkies in addition to the regular ones.
You can get something similar today. [Tokyo banana](https://www.tokyobanana.jp/language/en/). They're alright but a little expensive.
They still have them, but only on a limited-time basis.....at least in my area (NY).
Well you can also greatly reduced labor costs with modernization and automation.
They have reduced the size on thousands of products too
The new fries have an unpleasant bitter aftertaste to me.

I think it's the oil they use.
I don't know what that is so I don't have an answer for you.
Almost. The company they featured was basically Hostess, except they were loosing sales in general not going bankrupt. Axelrod's investment was specifically to spite Chuck Rhodes, not because he actually gave a crap about Not-Hostess's products.
I just figured my hands were growing.
Could be as simple as a different water source. 
Oh, much better comment than mine!
Totalitarian regimes =/= ideal political system

It's like using China as the example for what capitalism can only be
Each (US) Smartie is 0.31 cm^3, so 2367 smarties would require 740 cm^3, which is 0.740 liters or about 25 fl oz. 

So you can fit a can of Arizona tea up your ass with room to spare. 

Especially since Smarties are cylindrical, and so cannot be packed without gaps between them. 
Me and Proctor Ingram from Fallout 4, apparently. It's not that they taste like chalk. It's the texture. So many candies have that smooth glossy texture, and the ones that get close to NECCO wafers tend to be sour. So the niche is there where the NECCO wafer sort of stands as this sort of casual candy. It's mild in every way.

Or maybe I just find joy in bland things.
There are dozens of us!
I do. I haven't been able to get Necco wafers anywhere for years and I miss them.
Isn't that what Tums are for?
Mmm, so chalky!
That's exactly how I think of them. Tums, but actually or technically candy.
Apparently, it’s kind of the same with those candy buttons stuck to paper. I worked with a guy who had been a salesman in a lot of industries and he was at that factory for some reason and the manager offered him fresh candy buttons. He’d originally declined, but the manager insisted. He told me they tasted a lot different and much better fresh.
True, they are harder to chew, but they have much more courage than regular hearts if you manage to get one down
If you were born before the mid-1950’s then you might have actually had a living civil war vet for an uncle. 
are you kidding me? They suck on a stick of that stuff like a big stogie or cigareete.
Always love me some Roger

"Necco really knows how to make a disgusting candy." - Roger
As a skinny dude that likes to eat, I appreciate the hard work here. Good to know the source is legit.
Which makes them superior. You think not chocolate coated is better?!?

Savage heathen
They say history repeats itself.. I cant wait until all the good snacks come back. Twinkies, coke, neccos, etc..
What I might try is to whip some pureed [Gros Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana) bananas into a cream base and pipe it into the Bon Appetit [copycake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD2OOTx2G9k)
Have you ever seen how this stuff is made? You may not know it, but you are a victim of Chinese propaganda.
Shrinkage is definitely a thing. I wasn't clear in my original post, but I was mostly thinking of hostess, tasteecake and other similar single serve  snacks .
It is. I remember having to get used to the taste in my teens when they changed the oil after trans fats were banned. It was kind of a bitter/tart combo for me. These days I prefer fries from Rallys/Checkers. 
Very true. Same reason why getting heirloom bread starters are basically a scam (this *mostly* doesn't include the 70 year old starter your great grandmother passed down to you, as long as you're still living in the same area). 

You can't get French yeast and French water anywhere else but France. 
You're just saying "not real communism" but that's a cheap cop out. I get it a lot. You guys really need to think harder than this. Shit, Marx did. He wrote libraries of works, but 99.99% of self described communists have only read a single, short essay he coauthored. And I bet even that is a generous estimation. 

The fact of the matter is that any system that has called itself communist becomes a totalitarian regime rapidly. If every example of the government style in action ends that way, it is incredibly disingenuous to say "not real communism". It's just the No True Scotsmen argument aimed at an ideal. 

If that actually is the case, and those regimes weren't "real communism", then "real communism" doesn't exist anywhere and never has. Again, they have all ended that way. 

So it just sounds good on paper. I liken it to Thomas More's *Utopia*. Utopia can only exist where it always has existed, you cannot create a utopia on top of the rubble of previous flawed systems. 

You can't even say this isn't expected. Marx talked about it explicitly. His idea was that the totalitarian regime would be transitional, they it would eventually go away willingly, and hand all power to the workers, only after having used that authoritarian power to essentially "clean up anyone who might be a problem". Stalin later used this concept as his personal blank check. It's why thousands at once were convicted in sham trials and executed, and buried in mass graves. According to the *honest* communist, Stalin just *didn't get the job done fast enough*. Which is to say there should've been more horrific, obscene violence. And there are those types of people even here on reddit who would totally accept that. Genocides on par and even exceeding the numbers of the holocaust apparently weren't enough for those types. One can easily see how most people would find that extremely distasteful, to say the least. Remember this was a time when a popular form of public execution was being placed in a barrel, having nails driven through all sides of the barrel, and then having the public roll your ass down main street. It is always more than simple "cleaning up undesirables", it's reinforcing sadism and deconstructing the idea of humanity to do away with empathy. The nazis did very similar shit. 

Karl Marx was not a stupid person by any means, quite the contrary, and arguably *the* single most influential thinker of the past two hundred years (last May marked his 200th birthday). He literally wrote the textbook that changed the face of more than half the planet. So just know, I have respect for Marx. A lot. I've read a lot of his work. 

But he was human. And in this instance he was *wrong*, and greatly underestimated the tenacity with which a dictator (or ruling class/party) will cling to their power. He made what history has since proven time and time again, a very unrealistic idea as his goal.

I mean look at the most successful "communist" regime of all, China. They are communists like Nazis were socialists. In name only. They are State Capitalists and under an authoritarian regime, complete with a newly minted dictator for life. Their communist experiment failed a long time ago (horrifically, for them) and they just never changed the sign on the door. Russia did. They stopped pretending to be communist when the second most successful communist regime collapsed under the weight of itself, the USSR.

After that, Venezuela and Cuba, though I could name atrocities both those regimes leveled, on par with Hitler and Stalin alike, just at a smaller scale. Castro murdered or ordered the murder of thousands. So did Guevara. So did Chavez. These regimes never relinquish power. The one example you might be able to point to is the USSR itself, but everyone knows that wasn't a relinquishment, it was a restructuring of power. The KGB took the reins and rebranded Russia as a capitalist nation. Now we have Putin, for life.. Yippee.

Sorry, but "real communism" means "what communism practically is", and what it practically is is a banner for dictators to wave to get the people to trust them long enough to seize total control. There's a reason every communist leader has had their own little cult of personality. You need that to become a dictator, there isn't a way to do so otherwise.

The texture is like popeye cigarettes, it's chalky and brittle but not too hard. I would love to know if there's more types of chalky goodness out there.
I like flavored tums! I don’t even get heart burn my wife does. Never had them until I got married.  A+ ++
It's not the taste. It's the *consistency*.
> Proctor Ingram from Fallout 4

When does she mention liking chalky stuff/wafer candy?
Or at least *a* dozen.
Hell, the pink one even tastes like Pepsi bismo. 
 
I despise the chocolate rolls, but the rainbow rolls are good every once in a while. 
Not too many people conceiving children at age 100. Maybe if a somewhat younger man had a much younger wife and and much older step-brother who made it into the last few months of the Civiil War.
You must be from the Greater Northeast Guild of Blue Collar Pre Great War Live Action Role Players, Pre Rock Candy schism school. I agree with you in principle but the iron fist of my guild prevents me from acting on it. Jimmy Hoffa wasn't killed by the mob my friend, but by guys who were LARPing as the mob.

>I cant wait until all the good snacks come back. I cant wait until all the good snacks come back.

would this be neccomancy?
well, we did get surge and Crystal Pepsi...
Crystal Pepsi is basically dead in the water though. Every time it tries, someone fucks it up,  intentionally. 

The first time they tried it, coca cola released an intentionally bad, clear cola competitor. People tried it and decided clear cola is a bad idea all together. Then just a year or so ago, there was a nostalgic resurgence. People selling original clear Pepsi on ebay and shit. Pepsi even released some themselves.

 Then a fucking *nazi - themed clear cola* got released and again, clear cola is not something worth pursuing for any business. 
You're waiting for New Coke to be released again?

Sadist. 
I'm a production supervisor in a manufacturing facility. What do you do for a living?
Especially in the pool
When I lived down south, Checkers was absolutely my favorite.

Everything tasted relatively high quality for fast and cheap food.

Do they still fry their apple pies?
I almost feel like being able to taste that subtle of a difference would be a burden. 

A tasty, warm, flaky, buttery burden. 
Damnit, stop writing good posts!
Calling bullshit on the misuse of a word is not a cheap out. Definition of terms should be the first step of any honest approach to research. To just write this off as a no true scotsman is a mistake which enables a strawman. 
I highly doubt you have read anything besides a “short essay Marx coauthored”. There have been people saying that Bolshevism and the like isn’t real communism since before the Bolsheviks came into power. Read a history textbook ffs.
be right back
Rice is delicious.

If you like peppermint, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Sweet-Stripes-Mints-Peppermint/dp/B01E7AI6LI/) is the chalkiest candy I've ever had. I love it. 
I have to eat the lime Tums as my wife hates that one flavor of them. So not a problem!

I've got a little surprise for you. Remember how you told me about those sweets  you loved so much? You know, the ones that look like little colored disks? Well,  Quinlan's last sweep and retrieve patrol just came in, and they found a whole  roll of them. If that doesn't put a smile on your face, I don't know what will. Now how about heading over to my quarters this evening and we can split it together. Don't worry, I'll be a complete gentleman. I just hate seeing you storm all over the repair bay with that damn scowl on your face, and I think this will cheer you up. 
Pepsi bismo
Speaking of younger wives, the last known civil war widow (Maudie Hopkins) didn’t die until 2008. That’s not a typo, 2008. 


Edit: while we’re on the subject, here’s an article from 2014 about the surviving children of civil war vets - [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/news/special-features/2014/11/141111-veterans-day-150-anniversary-civil-war-memories).
you can't satisfy an oral fixation from smoking  with a fucking necco wafer! You need something long to suck on. I'd think you'd know that since you like to suck on long hard things.
Yes. Yes it would.
I bought several cases of surge and swear I had N64 flashbacks
And now in Japan we have Clear Coke.  The world is weird.
the caramel color used to color Pepsi and coke is carcinogenic.   
Surge... Dude. Is that still around anywhere? 
Clear Coke just got released this summer in Japan.  The main marketing gimmick is that it's 0 calorie, not that it's clear.  So Coke may be learning to lean away from the clear aspect and market other parts.
I want cocaine cola
Cool. How, specifically, would they improve production costs?
I'm not sure about the apple pies, since I kind of despise apple pie. I'd hit google for that one. But they've only gotten better IMO. Their value menu is one of the best deals going, with tons of variety. It's super easy to eat cheap there.
Look at my history man. I just love writing and expressing myself. I don't get much social interaction in my life, my wife really isn't interested in 90% of the things I am, so.. I write. One day I'm gonna publish a book. I just don't have any clue what it'll be or be about. 
If that's all you can respond with then you're not here to discuss anything in good faith. 
Doubt in one hand, shit in another.. 

.. and I won't care which fills first. You'll still just be holding out shit as an offering to this discussion. 
Mom is that you?
Aww, that's sweet... Thank you for that. I have a stupid crush on Ingram, and I'm surprised I missed that.
Yay! Pismo beach!
I read your comment in Randy Savage's voice and I swear you were about to say snap into a slim jim. True, for the purposes of the joke I admit Necco wafers are a poor substitute for both tobacco AND penises. But nobody really chomps on rock candy like a stogie either.  I guess what I'm saying is that I'm rethinking this whole joke now.
Dude you're trashing a fantastic joke.
mmm sacrelicious 
That stuff is good but weird. 
Is it really?   Source?
yup in norway and i think you can get cans of it on amazon
Available at my local gas stations and quik marts. Ymmv
it is (or was) reintroduced in a couple areas. a few places had it when I was staying in central Arkansas, but sadly there is none near me where i am now.
I saw that while checking my facts on Google, actually. I hear it's hitting America sometime this year.

Technically Coke since 1903 hasn't had cocaine in it, they use spent leaves and the company in NJ that provides them the extract from it is the only one in the US authorized to process coca leaves. The cocaine removed from the process is given to pharmaceutical companies, and the spent leave extract given to Coca-Cola.

Interesting enough, the government sued Coca-Cola to change its formula, but not because of the cocaine... in the 1910's they wanted them to remove the caffeine from the kola seeds used in the formula, and the government lost the case, but made it so any caffeine in products had to be included on the label.
We've got to go back Marty!
I'll have to RES tag you as "future bestselling author". :D
Socialism implies worker control of industry on the national scale. When has this happened? We cant just change definitions and then bash the strawman we just made. Theres a difference between a mode of production and whats been done in its name. 
I may be wrong, but has any country ever voted (actually legitimately voted) for communism? Haven't they all been results of rebellion? Couldn't that be the main issue? Obviously if a country begins with a rebellion led by a strong leader, and decides to implement a system of government which lends itself to authoritarianism, it's going to have a pretty small chance of a successful future.

If a country with a strong Democratic background peacefully voted for itself to become Communist and then STILL ended up with an authoritarian regime, then your argument of "well that's just how communism works" would be legitimate. But until then, you don't actually have a control group to determine if that would be a deciding factor or not.
It’s a fact of history. Socialists have criticized, rebelled, and even fought wars against authoritarian forms of socialism since the rise of the Soviet Union.
Didn’t think I’d see one of my favorite beaches mentioned in a thread on r/news. Lots of good memories taking dirt bikes, buggies, and 4 wheelers to the dunes out there.
Did I go too far? 
You got kinda sweet and chalky puns. 
"Soft drink consumers are being exposed to an avoidable and unnecessary cancer risk from an ingredient that is being added to these beverages simply for aesthetic purposes," says Keeve Nachman, senior author of the study, director of the Food Production and Public Health Program at the center, and an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "This unnecessary exposure poses a threat to public health and raises questions about the continued use of caramel coloring in soda."

https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/03/07/148075310/coca-cola-modifies-caramel-color-to-avoid-cancer-warning-label
I remember that too!  There was some sort of clear root beer that I liked.  I found it as an adult and it honestly wasn't that great.
So you’re saying there’s a chance?
Right, but there are a lot of other alkaloids beside cocaine in those leaves, many of them psychoactive. People will do re-extractions in illegal productions that keep addicts from withdrawal
D'awh, shucks. 
And you also can't take the banner off communism and pretend it's never been honestly flown before.

The definition of fascism doesn't include genocide. Would you say then that fascism has been misrepresented by the likes of Germany? Of course not. 1940s Germany is the yardstick for fascism. So too does communism have various yardsticks, and none make it look good.

You want to talk about "socialism", fine. Talk about socialism. Socialism isn't the same as communism. Isn't that what the left has spent the last thirty years trying to educate people about? 
The idea of "voting in communism democratically" is one that is seen with a certain level of disdain among actual communists. 

Communism is by definition a revolutionary thing. It is meant to usurp. That's the way it is supposed to work.

That said, yes, Communists have been elected, however very rarely and never without critics saying "That isn't communism". 
Kerala, India has a communist-led government. Ironically though, it's biggest source of income is citizens *who work in other nations* ... and then pay taxes. Doesn't sound very communist to me.
Honestly, *living* is carcinogenic. I really can’t put much stock in those studies that claim a correlation between *X* and cancer anymore.

Especially since every product known to man basically has to have a “this product is known to the State of California to cause cancer” label on it nowadays, no matter how benign. 
good looking out
Crystal gravy.
Well I was typing up a long multi paragaraph reply about the futility of trying to look at a user's post history since the whole purpose of this site was to foster discussion of ideas and not build a cult of personality, and how since 2015 / Chairwoman Pao Reddit has devolved into only judging a post based on a user's history and fishing for doxxing [looks at 4th wall like Deadpool would], but then I realized I don't have your gift of gab or the brevity of wit.

So you're welcome and good luck on the future book!
The banner is all that was ever flown...nothing of substance behind the veneer. It was simply fascists usurping a preferred mode of production. Socialism by definition is the democratization of the economy. Im for democracy. Not afraid of it. I dont see it as mob-rule. Not when organized. 
Only if Ronald Reagan and Max Headroom take my order.
I saw the ad for this  about a couple nights ago. looked interesting, but not going to spend that kind of money on a soda bottle. 
So what they are selling is a $30 bottle of soda and a video file I could pirate in 4 minutes.
No, they are selling a real version of a movie prop, temporarily.

Don't like it, buy something else.
I thought it cost $20.15. Also with that mentality why buy anything? "So what, they are selling a Corvette for $75,000 that I could boost in 4 mins?"
"So what, they are selling a pizza for $15 when I could rob a delivery driver for one for free and probably get his fanny pack with like $17 in it?" 

You are a hard dude man with your wicked piracy skills. 
So it would seem. Can't blame them for the cash grab though. 
Get it before your outta time.
Well thats a little better I guess.

And I'm not going to buy it, or anything else that is a free as the air we breath. 
Once I can download and printout a corvette I will.  Good luck checking registrations of every "printout car" to make sure some company that used to produce this good before technology made their buisness model obsolete gets to demand money for no reason.
It's a custom bottle it's not air...
So mom walks in because he's yelling over a video game, he gets mad and breaks his headset, blames her and then kills her and runs.
I feel for that family.


It’s no joke, but this sounds a bit like my (mentally ill) brother.  He blames any destructive and violent behavior on everyone around him.  He’s super delusional and has no impulse control.  He doesn’t own any firearms, but doesn’t mean he couldn’t manage to kill another person in a fit of what-have-you.



So sad for the dad. Lost his wife and son over a stupid argument.
Ugh my brother (25) still lives at home playing computer games all day and is an asshole to my parents, refusing to get a job or help out around the house. This is my greatest fear. 
Yes, the headset was the problem.  It definitely wasn't the underlying anger issues, emotional lability, and lack of frustration tolerance.  
this guys used to be my gf’s supervisor. they worked together at an afterschool program. we’re both shook from this. im still in awe

Most of these comments are trash 
The real question is... What game was he playing?
I love my mom so much I can’t fathom murdering her over something so igsignificant and replaceable in comparison man. Like you have to be fucked in the head. Stuff like this makes me really scared to have children 
Do they never, ever, just stop and think about their age and that they're living with their mom, and their headset is their most important thing?

Then again this guy doesn't exactly have all his nuts and bolts.
Ceres is a Northern California now? I consider it Central California.
Looks like the chicken tendies weren’t baked just right
All he wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to him.
I knew this family. 
I work at the Veterinary office they brought their animals too. 
She was a kind woman.......
All of us at work are beyond belief today. 
That’s really sad. Over something so insignificant. 
The whole thing broke my heart. A dispute over a video game headset, a dead mother, a family torn to pieces.
how much karma do you think he has
That dude was going nowhere fast in life.
He did not know da wea
Boomers fuck up economy, blames Millenials.

Millenials doesn't move out, shoots Boomers.

seems bout right.
Nearly thirty, living at home with his parents. Shoots mom in the hea in front of his nearly 70 year old Dad, who then kicks his ass and takes the gun from him before he manages to run away. This guy sort of defines the word *Pathetic* doesn't he.
Seth Rogan has no chill
The amount of people shitting on this guy for living at home at 28 years old is amazing. Not everyone can afford to move out when they turn 18, assholes.

Wtf, this is just awful.
I'm sure tendies were involved as well
This belongs in r/justneckbeardthings
Which begs the question in other similar situations, is 28 too late for an abortion?
I wonder what game he was playing? Maybe CsGo?
This is sad I’ve worked with kids with mental health with very similar issues.. always worried something might happen like this. 
r/justneckbeardthings
This is a problem with easily accessible guns. People get angry and will use them over stupid things 
Men of 2018 went a long way from WW2 generation
If only the mom had a gun too.
That's one sad, pathetic, mother fucker right there...
Just another example of why having a gun in the home *increases* the chance someone you know is shot.

Tool for protection, indeed.
Who among us....wait nvm no
stories like this are never as skin deep as the title suggests. there is always more going on in the peoples lives we don't know about.
Wtf he gets no bail.. oh you shoot an unarmed man or call in a fake hostage situation and get a man killed over it also on the wrist 
What game was he raging over? Dota 2? 
[removed]
What a fucking loser. Just look at this guy and you immediately get it. 28 years old and still living with mom and playing video games all day, to the point he fucking murdered his own mother over a busted headset.

Fucking... *loser*. Society is better off without him.

Dad shoulda shot him.
This guy looks like Seth Rogan.
Must have been a good headset
What game was he playing?
This guy wont last long in prison thats for sure
Sounds like a person who never had his mental issues disgnosed.

When he's talking on the phone loudly to a call in sports show when his mom keeps yelling at him to keep it down. 
He looks like the kind of spoiled piece of trash that would do something like this
Guns are good though, right?  

That way if you lose your temper you can *really* fuck your life up. 
Wow, 28 years old and still living at home with mom jerking off to porn and being a complete worthless bum. Hopefully there is a special place in hell for this maggot.
I am sickened by some of these comments. Have some of you no common courtesty? 
I'm going to guess he is a T_D and /pol/ devotee.
After reading this article I called my parents and told them both I love them very much.
south park generation
Another sad part about it is the comments trying to tear into the obvious mentally ill person. Do people not understand what mental health is? Disgusting. 
He was probably playing "Call of Duty" online at the time of the incident.
so he breaks a headset because of his mom and now he will never play a video game again?  wow
How convenient that this is a mainstream story when they now diagnosis video game players with mental conditions. 
Idiot, he’s just killed the only person that will always love him. What a nasty piece of shit.
Yup. Looks like the subreddit The_Donald lost another respected member :p
He was probably playing player's unknown battle ground. But seriously what the actual fuck. Pure evil has been confused with mental illness for far too long, it's time healthcare gets it's shit together.

Sounds like he lost his son a long time ago
If I was that dad, I wouldn't feel I've lost much with that kid in jail.

28 years old and shoot his mom because of a video game headset... manchild of the year, no?
He lost his son long ago. 
The dad has pretty bad dementia. I work in the city this happened. One of my students is their next door neighbor. 
He lost his wife and son because he kept a gun in the house. Most people who are shot are killed by people they know, not random strangers.
[deleted]
What is the guy like?  Could you have reckoned he might do something crazy like this?
I don't know if awe is the word I'd normally use in this situation. 
I'm afraid I'm going to have to break your headset under laboratory conditions to confirm.
I’m proud of you. Keep up the work. 
Not yet anyways.
Well adjusted for *now*, but what if you accidentally broke your headset, huh? 
This would go a long way to explaining why he was so pissed that he murdered his mother.
Asking the real questions, also what platform? 
I think stories like these shouldn't scare you from having children. They should scare you from poorly raising your children.

If at 28 he is having violent arguments with his mom about video games, then the parents did something very wrong raising him.
He is most assuredly fucked in the head.
I don't even like my mom and I would *never* consider hurting her. Kids these days are turning into sociopaths
What I thought when I read the article: "What The Fuck"
No one can fathom actually murdering anybody unless there is a serious mental issue going on.

I'll tell you more - if you rationally conclude a murder is worth it, and you try to willpower yourself into killing a person - you're not gonna be able to do it, assuming you're healthy. Not even with a gun, not even by moving your finger a little bit.

Unless it's a survival situation, a healthy person cannot kill. A healthy mind will always see a person in a person - then it feels as impossible as suicide.

The dude was fucked up. Games had nothing to do with it. A preexisting condition for sure. Sad.
maybe his mom was a total bitch to him raising him. that's why he's living in her house still. we shouldn't just write the victim off as some angel. im playing the devil's advocate here. but there should be proper character assessment before we make any judgments
my money is on him being a redpiller/incel.

I can already imagine the kind of reddit posts this guy was writing up...
Yeah, pretty sure his elevator skips a few floors. Perhaps he’d love to play the r/neckbeardRPG.
This ass and what he did to his mom just fits those Millennial stereotypes that Baby Boomers love to gossip over.

Living with his mother past 21YO? Check.

Video game player? Check.

Getting over-emotional because of video games? Check.
It's in the Central Valley.
Right. It's way south of Sacramento. I don't understand how they considered it northern California. Then again alot of people have no idea that the central valley even exists.
If delineating the state into north/south, the line between the two is just south of Merced.   The exact center of the state is east in a town called "North Fork" 


Maybe it is to people from LA but not to anyone from Northern California. I had the misfortune to live there for about 3 months.
She put the fries and the tendies in the oven at the same time, so they weren't done together.

Unforgivable.
Just a Pepsi...
Why is living at home at 28 pathetic?

I swear reddit is full either of kids with no perception of life or just simple garbage people.
Man, reddit got defensive as fuck from this lol.
There's a decade between 18 and 28.
It is also the problem with stupid people. I mean I wouldn't ever want to kill my mum, no matter how many guns I had access to.
This is the problem with people not receiving the mental health help they need no sane person gets mad and shoots someone even if they have a gun not saying guns should be easily accessible but seems more like a mental health issue to me.
Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times.
Reminds me of that South Park episode where the whole town got guns and waved them at each other over the smallest thing. Funny thing is, they then resolved the dispute, showing the ridiculousness of that argument.
Especially when that person is clearly nuts. You don't just go from being a sane and normal person to this with nothing in between.
I have a feeling he would of just stabbed her to death if there wasn't a gun.
Look at his picture and read the article. This one is exactly what it sounds like. I've known guys like this. What an asshole.
Typically there is no bail on murder charges.
Really? How’d you figure that out?
Are people being mean to the overgrown coddled man-child who broke his toy in a fit of anger and then shot his mother in the head over it?

I'm sorry, I'll try to be nicer.

What does any of this have to do with politics?
Real classy. 
This post honestly is what depresses me about this site. 

Why the fuck is your reaction to this tragedy about some fringe group on reddit
It’s like you’re happy assuming the political affiliation of someone who shot their mother over a headset. I hate Trump as much as the next guy, but I don’t see the connection, or the glee to make that connection. 
People who show up just to drop a match on the kindling like this are just as bad as inflamatory T_D posters. You can't act like you have the moral high ground and then start shit on a TOTALLY unrelated thread...
/r/whataboutthedonald
Which is Hillary Clintons fault.
Actually, if you did some research you'd find out he was a dem and voted for Hilary. It's all over his Facebook. 
"I love to drag politics into shit where it doesn't belong!"

-You.

I hate Trump as much as the next guy, but can we maybe *not* drag him into random threads to push your agenda?
And now this is yet another political shit flinging contest. Good job asshole.
What fun times to be non-American. There's pretty much no place on the entire web where I don't have to read about your fucking politics.
SMH.   You're a disgrace to the family name.    Turn in your badge and club.
He is in California, odds are he is a Hillary supporter.
Sack of shit.
I just got banned from that sub for saying “mike pence hates gays”

I’m not even mad that sub is for morons
because hes white?
Was he really a known trump supporter? 
You sick individual. Using a tragedy to get a cheap shitty joke in. You are the liberal polar opposite of the_donald.
lol implying it wouldn't be libtards considering they're the only ones shooting/beating politicians.

Granted, shooting/beating yours would only make them prettier/smarter, so that's a poor move regardless
Oh dear. It appears as though your post has triggered the snowflakes.

To get through this, just adopt the tactics of the anti-SRS crowd: Simply explain that your post is a joke, and is thus immune to any criticism whatsoever. If necessary, elaborate that perhaps people objecting to it "hate free speech" and possibly also "need a safe space."
Congrats. You took absolutely nothikng and tried to make it political. Seriously fuck you. You're the problem with this country and Reddit right now. How desperate and sad are you people that you have to turn everything into a political "herpderp must be a trumpster" fucking get over yourselves. Have a normal convo with people for once.
Edit: ahh downvotes. So this is what we've become. So divided that not going along with the circlejerk interject Trump hate in ever thread that has nothing to do with Trump, gets you downvoted. This is pathetic.
Let’s see 

1) Neckbeard- check

2) Gamer- check

3) Antisocial disorders- check

4) Of European Descent- check

I’d say this is a very reasonable assumption based on the presence of multiple factors.
lmao u sure told those drumpftards😂😂😂
Who gets to decide what's too mentally ill to own a gun?
My brother? Looking at our state laws, probably not, though it looks like there the court could have to issue an order re: his mental health, first?  I’m not sure if I’m reading it properly..

In any case, some of what my brother is dealing with is obvious, and I would **hope** any dealer he had contact with would deny him a sale.

The guy in the news? No idea. And it’s tough - how do we judge how mentally ill is “too,” mentally ill to own a firearm?
It was in California, though not the Bay Area or anything so it could've been more lenient process. Hell many in the Bay have guns in homes, just can't carry with them
In super-strict California? He probably got that gun from Leland Yee's illegal weapons ring.
A bunch of things, if you’re referring to my brother.  Paranoid schizophrenia, and he has some moderate to severe intellectual and developmental disorders.

As I mentioned in a previous reply, I’d hope any dealer that he came into contact would deny him a firearm purchase.  

It’s pretty obvious my brother is disabled, but whether someone would simply think he had a disability, or whether he was mentally ill, I’m not sure.  It’s difficult at times, for professional, even, to delineate his symptoms and diagnoses.
Emotional immaturity and probably depression. 
I could be wrong but I think the intention was sarcasm.
Look at this guy missing the point ^
[deleted]
this broke my heart
More like clinically insane. 
It could have been the son's gun. It only states that it was retrieved. Ownership was never addressed, unless you know something that wasn't written in the report. Either way, it could have just as easily been a knife or bare hands. It's still just sad.
Because he threatens to kill himself if they bring that up 
I don't know, because they're shitty parents? How about instead of taking your helicoptered overprotected sheltered shell of an adult child and sending him into the streets homeless, carless and jobless*, fucking take his fucking computer away until he gets a job, saves up, and moves out. Fucking christ, how hard is it? Does any parent realize that xboxes and computers aren't free? Why do you go from 0 to 100 -> "Here's  the world, no consequences or pressure, and just game all day..." to "Ok, we've done nothing to help you become an adult, now be homeless". There's an inbetween and it's called parenting and this particular problem has an easy solution. TAKE HIS FUCKING GAMES AWAY.

well he seemed ok. i met him once but my gf would tell me he would always snap at her and the other people working in the after school program.
she left before things got worse.
i asked her if he still worked at the elementary but i guess he left due to health issues. clearly this man is not stable at all.
One of my students lives next door to the house this happened in. She said she talked to the son all the time, and never would have guessed in a million years this would have happened. 
Semantics, I knew the meaning being conveyed behind the statement.
The archaic definition of "awe" is a feeling of dread and terror, so it works in an old timey way. (Like, medieval old times.)
This is not true. Some children are simply impossible 
A lot of parents are TOO nice to the point they enable them. As they say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Or something. 
I mean, only mental illness really explains this behavior. And I don't mean that this guy has to be "crazy" to have done it, but a combination of extreme rage and poor impulse control? That's close enough to crazy for me to label it mental illness. Certainly it wasn't a rational act.

Anyway, any kid could end up like this. You have a kid, he might end up being a selfish crazy fucker. It doesn't mean the parents are at fault.

edit: I should add that I don't have any kids. I'm not protecting myself from alternative points of view out of pride. This is just how I see the situation but I could be wrong.
That is a silly assumption. I'm a huge gamer and probably lived at home til I was about 28 too. Does that mean my parents raised me poorly?

Hell nah, they raised 6 of us kids. 3 of my sibling are now happily married and successful. I finally managed to move out on my own and get a nice career in tech. The youngest is about to graduate college soon. And then there's one who's kinda the black sheep with a gambling problem and no clear path in life.

Overall, I'd say my parents did an excellent job, but we're all unique individuals. No matter how well you raise your kids, there's always a chance for some craziness or something else. You can't blame the parents for everything.
This shit was brewing for a while. Nobody just up and shoots mom. This guy probably suffers from some sort of mental illness. If not that then there's a history of conflict between the two that just so happened to reach a boiling point over something mundane. I would encourage you to look at your own past: how many violent arguments have started over stupid shit in your life? 

And how many of them were actually *about* the stupid shit? 

That he shot her says he probably didn't do it for some sort of sadistic, psychotic, reason though. Shooting is pretty impersonal. People who are getting joy out of murder generally use knives or something like that. 

I'm sure if you looked at the history of these two you'd see a long line of arguments. Also he's 28 and living with his mom. Either he found her overbearing in general, a reminder of his personal failures in life, or he was actually angry at himself and she just happened to get caught up in it. 

That or he really is the kind of coddled manchild who would throw a fatal shitfit over gamer rage. Which looking at modern video game culture is actually a possibility for some reason. I mean fuck, just look at gamergate...
Very few parents are really capable of dealing with the seriously mentally ill.

But in the U.S. having someone placed in an affordable secure facility without them seriously injuring or killing someone first, is nearly impossible.
Pretty sure that reason isn't even close on a list of reasons why folks don't have children.
I agree that family is one of the biggest factors but one's environment consists of more than family. Maybe he had very toxic friends that had an impact on him.
Probably just has serious undiagnosed mental problems.  Normal people don't just do this over something so minor.

>  his elevator skips a few floors.

I'm gonna start saying this now. Thank you.
that's kind of fucked up because it makes so much sense to save on rent.... $1800/month (90% of my paycheck (at the time)) on rent, just so i can have a place to sleep... or i can go home and save that and have a garage too... 
Owns guns to compensate/make himself feel powerful.
Shiiiit Sacramento shouldnt even be considered Northern California. 

Only places that qualify as the state of Jefferson should be considered Northern California 
I was born in a Merced. The Central Valley has its own vibe, completely different from Southern or Northern California. But I understand people who’ve never been to California would think in north/south terms. 
I went to your schools, I went to your churches, I went to your institutional learning facilities.
A Pepsi, a Pepsi, my kingdom for a Pepsi
The perception is skewed on this pointing to some slacker who does nothing and mooches off of his parents.  

When I was 28 I sold my house and moved back in with my parents.  Paid their mortgage for them and bought all the groceries while I was there. Helped my dad take care of my ailing mom and then helped my dad while he recovered from a surgery.  

Totally killed my personal life though. 
i don't understand that either... it makes no sense to waste half your paycheck on rent just so you have a place to sleep because you'll be working and out most of the time anyways. it's definitely nicer, but not all of us can afford that luxury. only people i know that are doing it are people living paycheck to paycheck with 0 savings/investments or their parents pay for it.

i'd much rather just buy w.e the fuck i want with all of this surplus of money that i got
That is not remotely what /u/despotus said, unless YOU think all gamers that live with their parents are going to shoot them.
First off, thanks for asking a question in a super offense & combative way, I appreciate that a lot cause I get to skip straight to the part where I tell you to go fuck yourself and block your ass. Second, at 28 years old it isn't unreasonable to expect you to have the capacity to provide for your damn self, to gtfo of your Parents home and let *them* move on to the next stage of *their* lives. Give them some privacy, enjoy some of your own privacy and not be a burden on them. I love your response doesn't even vaguely consider the quality of life for the parents in that scenario, only yourself.
Because you've had a decade of adulthood to get your shit together and become independent.
It’s not pathetic if you’re a home carer and you’re looking after your parent/s or you’ve had to move back because of financial problems or mental health issues then being 28 and living with parents is acceptable... otherwise it is incredibly pathetic.
Living at home while you are in college or trade school or otherwise developing a career in something makes sound financial sense. You are typically done with that by the time you are 25 and are able to go off on your own and support yourself.

Many don't even have that luxury and have to support themselves from 18 on.

28? You are entering man child territory.
[deleted]
Speaking as a 27 year old turning 28 this year, I think it is sort of pathetic to be living at home with your parents still unless you had a good reason like a sick family member.   

Some people stumble in life, and have to move back in with their parents sometimes, and even though that sucks for them, I wouldn't hold it against them; but based on the fact that this guy reacted like this I would have a hard time believing he was doing well before this happened. 
28 yr old living with his parents in the city of Ceres.. that's really pathetic... This ain't bay area or LA, or San Diego.. this is a town you can pay mortgage out of a McDonald's burger job.
hey, and my profession, which requires a license, still only nets me enough to barely scrape by with my fiancee. But you know, wages will catch up with housing costs soon. I'm sure it's the same people complaining about millenials destroying America with their avocado toast.
Problem with mental health issues is that sometimes the first sign of an issue that would prompt someone to seek mental health care is when they take a gun and shoot someone.

Im curious in what context you read my comment? Just wanting clarification.
Ah, two what's?
Oh my god I can't believe I'm meeting a transformer in real life!
Let the tendies hit the floor.
He's a 28 year old living at home playing video games. You don't just live with an abusive parent for a decade after you no longer have to. 
Reddit has a fetish for blaming anything that occurs on T_D
Internet activism. Wanting to feel like something has been accomplished while putting out the absolute bare minimum of effort.

As long as someone sees they dislike the same thing everyone else does that's all that matters.
He’s a white male.  People assume he posts on T_D..
[deleted]
There was a similar story recently of a man who killed his father for something just as ridiculous-- something like not supporting Trump, and called his father a "pede" 

Edit: remembered slightly different. He called both parents "leftist pedos" and stabbed his father multiple times, killing him. Allegedly he was called a nazi by him.


He mentioned T_D, not politics.
Maybe it's a reference to [this](http://uk.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-white-gamers-seinfeld-joshua-green-donald-trump-devils-bargain-sarah-palin-world-warcraft-gamergate-2017-7?r=US&IR=T)?

Na, California has tons of hicks that blame Mexicans for all their problems. Remember that's where Devin Nunes comes from.
He was in Northern California, which is basically a different state economically and politically when compared to SoCal. Odds are the complete opposite.
Yeah, too bad the Central Valley is full of trumptards and I would put money on him being one based on his man-child shitfit outburst that ended with someone dead.

Hypocritical pos!
Civility?! ON REDDIT?!
I realize you're posing what seems to be a legitimate hypothetical in which people can be forbidden from buying guns on dubious claims of mental instability, but the simple answer is this:

"Psychologists who have been trained to identify violent individuals, independent of the government. If you believe it would be unfair that you'd need to see a psychologist and determine you adequately comprehend the impact of taking a life, then please examine existing laws of similar nature in certain states regarding abortion."
Congress would set some sort of standards and allow professionals to figure it out. 
Pretty sure neither of those make it relatively possible for someone to kill their parent...
That doesn't fit the description at all.
Then enlighten us. What's the point?
Look at this guy not having fun^
Probably the only way she could have defended herself, but who knows. It's a complicated world. Lots of factors play into this sort of thing and hindsight is 20/20 which doesn't do any good for the near-sighted past. 
He's a nut! He's crazy in the coconut!
I don't think enabling him is really helping him though. I hope they are least looking into professional help for him. 

I hear about situations like this, and things never change unless they are removed from the environment that let's them live like this. I've seen it go both ways though. It's very tough to do that to your own child... But I don't think they are doing him any favors by letting him live like that.
Welp, I can see why you're concerned. That's a genuine bummer.
Sounds like [emotional blackmail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_blackmail?wprov=sfla1).
My brother uses this for everything! It gets to the point where you want to dare him to follow through. 
Try to get him mental health if he refuses then tell him he needs to get a job. If he refuses have a cop come escort him off. You become a bad parent when you can’t stand up to your children. 

But it might be a gaming addiction. Ever thought of turning off the internet? You can’t just keep supplying alcohol to an alcoholic.
So everything works out.
We had one of those. After 15 years of therapy and zero results, it was his comfort or our insanity. We chose to have a home without all the chaos. He didn't kill himself, he's just busy driving the rest of the world crazy. 
Call his bluff.

Or maybe stop enabling his behavior. He knows what he's doing when he does that. 
Call him out. Teach him that you can't make empty threats. Also teach him that he needs to get his shit together.

Or you can just take his power cable away. That works too.
Wow... yeah, my parents would beat the shit out of me if I was like your brother. Put the fear of god into my soul and discipline my ass. Hell, it happened before when I was a kid, cause I was an absolutely unruly kid. 

White parents man... you really need to learn to beat your kids. 
Nah, they’re not shitty parents. He chooses to ignore them, refuses to get help, and blames them for his problems. How do you help someone that refuses to help themselves? 
Can you find out what headphones they were?  
They completely overlooked that in the story.
I'm sure everyone will stick to the headset thing and that he had a history of severe outbursts will be swept under the rug. :(
I knew a guy... he also seemed ok.  One day he choose a random old man and beat him to death on the sidewalk while jabbering about demons.
Your first sentence contradicts everything you said after it
Yep.

It's just, as I said, not normally the word I'd use these days. 
I used to tutor a lot of kids, and I can say some are just born bad. It's not a popular opinion, but I would get to know a family with 3 perfect kids and then one nightmare child that refused to listen, did weird sex shit, or couldn't control himself. It was like they were developmentally challenged, but not to the point they couldn't function, but just enough that they slowly collected maladaptive behaviors that turned them into young adults with zero coping skills beyond terrorizing people to get what they want. 
That's fine for 0-15. But after a point he's interacting with the world enough outside of just his parents and should be learning a lot more from society. Guy was 28 - that's a decade out of high school for his peers to either give him an example of how to be/not to be or level him out.
28 still living at home? I’m leaning towards the parents enabling shitty behavior and this guy never really being held accountable for his actions.
I agree with Havoola. Parents do not have any influence on many children. There's no such thing as environmental stresses. It's all biology and determined 100% by biology.  **/S**.
Being too nice to me sounds a lot like overcompensating; I just don't believe something like this happens if the parents are being good parents, which to me means believing that your child is just as 'evil' as any other child and acting accordingly in a manner that doesn't harm your child.


Ignoring this about your child is the opposite of being nice, I think.
> I mean, only mental illness really explains this behavior.

Perhaps, but only if you consider the kind of massively-entitled and no self control jackasses that troll Reddit and online portals as mentally ill.  The sad fact here is there are a lot of people out there I could see doing this if they snapped at just the wrong time.  
There is not one word in the article about mental illness. Sometimes assholes kill people because they’re assholes.
Did you have violent arguements with your mother about video games too? Because that was the issue, not the person playing video games and living at home at the age of 28. 
Only people to kill anyone in the gamergate debate were people virtue signaling against them.   Funny that...
Can we not stereotype this guy based off his photograph? What he did was horrifying but being white and bearded is hardly enough evidence to infer more about his social leanings
Go home, save the money for your own place. Pay a little for what you use and hug your mum often.

If somebody says something, just straight out tell them that you find it irresponsible to waste so much money on rent that you could save to get your own place.
I have 3 guns because I like them. Do they make me feel powerful? No. Like anyone can go get a gun. 
I agree Sacramento is probably the northern most point of the central valley
Not sure if you intended to imply that I've never been, I assure you that I've spent at least 30 years perched neatly in the northern half and am quite familiar with damn near every geographical region of the entire state. 

That said, strictly speaking Merced is in the north half with San Jose and Weed. (And the west half as well along with Tahoe and San Francisco) 
I mean I live on my own with a few weeks of money in the bank and my parents haven't given me a dime.
Go build your own fucking life, you no-account mooch!
Eventually you gotta take off the training wheels my man 
Where's the consideration for your parents? Why are they not allowed to move on to the next stage in their lives instead of perpetually caring for their children. They have to be saddled with you so you can save on rent? Fuck that. Fuck you. Grow the fuck up, if you want to cut down on the costs of living, get some room mates.
Mooooooooch. Grow up
its beginning to become unreasonable though. plenty of people in their mid 20s cannot survive on their own.
I think the problem is when you still treat it like living at home with your parents instead of treating it as a roommate situation, with defined rules and expectations. 

Also, I don't think it's good to make fun of people for living with their parents. Shit happens. My house was robbed and my hours at my job were cut and thus I had to live with my mom and stepdad. I try and find work and maybe think that I could leave, but then my stepdad finds out that he has Stage 4 cancer. It's recently gone terminal and there's a hospice bed in the living room. I've only been at my new job for a week and I've already had to talk to them about bereavement leave, which they've been cool about. All of this while studying for the Series 6...

Yeah, I wish I had my own place...
Many also don't have the luxury of having parents that can afford to support them forever...
Im actually 23 living at home.

I get to save every single euro I earn as I do not have any expenses living at home.

I probably make much more money than you do

Sorry for spotting your retardness
There are other cultures in this world where staying with your parents is normal, even encouraged, because you’re supposed to care for them.
In Europe this is pretty normal as it is hard to get a job anywhere.

Thats why I meant most of reddit has no perception of life in general, does not surprise me as reddit is almost 90% american.
if you share the house with 4 others maybe.  Ceres is a commutable distance to Stockton, Modesto, and parts of the East Bay.  Cheaper homes are still in the 200k range. 
I didn't say anything about your profession. My parents moved out of state when I turned 18. I went 50 thousand dollars in debt and got my electrical engineering degree. Here I am at 32 making six figures, no school debt and paying off my truck and getting my EE masters this year. I have very little sympathy for others who need to make their own way in life, I was handed nothing, not a cent from my parents and nothing in student aid since my parents made too much.
And without the gun they would stab someone, or build a bomb, or use their car to run them over.
Excellent recovery
It's the internet not real life.
The world can only get so cold... 
I mean the dude lives in California, odds are he's a liberal.

Nah, I thought it because he shot his mom over a video game. It's either that or 4Chan.

Edit: Oh, come on now, guys. I'd stake my 401K on him having visited /b/ at least once. You would too. It'd be the easiest money ever made. 
Or it has something to do with the fact that he blamed other people for something stupid he'd obviously done himself, which is a thing Trump and his supporters do on a regular basis. 
he's white AND an immature cunt. the latter is a crucial factor in assuming he posts on T_D.

There's probably emails about this.
[](/skepticalstarlight)There's an equal number of self proclaimed hard line libertarians in Silicon Valley and other tech industry hubs. Most friends of mine who work in that industry can attest to how many young programmers have gone down that road. There's a growing trend of "fuck you got mine" people in tech hubs.
It's incredible how Democrat-leaning Los Angeles is boxed in by alt-right conservatives in the Westside (SaMo, Malibu, Palisades, Beverly Hills), the OC and the Inland Empire.
Fair enough, but unless somebody got a link to his FB page or knows him in IRL, none of us really knows. 
I've noticed California conservatives are especially grumpy because they're the ones that have to reside in that illegal immigrant protecting 'communist shithole'.

> If you believe it would be unfair that you'd need to see a psychologist and determine you adequately comprehend the impact of taking a life, then please examine existing laws of similar nature in certain states regarding abortion.

This line seems like you're arguing, "If you think it would be unfair if the law is X, then also look over here where the law is X as justification for us continuing to be unfair."  That seems backwards.  Shouldn't the rationale be, "Hey, you think X is unfair, can you also help us oppose X over here as well, because if it's unfair for this, then it's also unfair for that?"
There is then another moral question to ask; what illnesses will qualify? Those that are already violent? You can’t know until they commit an act of violence. Those that have the potential to be violent? Then you’ve removed the right to bear arms and effectively self-defense from an individual who has not yet committed any wrongdoing. Plenty of clinical sociopaths, the manically depressed, schizophrenics, dissociative identity sufferers, PTSD sufferers, and the bipolar never commit violent acts, never harm another human being, and function perfectly in society. Should we take away a right purely because they *might* do something? 

Perhaps once a violent episode, with or without a firearm, has been committed then maybe we could examine barring them from owning guns from that point on. But then that in itself opens the door to removing that right from convicted criminals. My father went to prison years ago, but has no less right to own a gun than anyone, especially given that he used it to defend himself, my step-mother, and my little brother from an intruder not long ago. Perhaps we could allow that a licensed psychologist can declare someone fit to own a gun after an incident? Similarly to how people can be examined for ‘reform’ after jail-time? Alright, but then we to look at numerous cases of the mentally ill in mental hospitals not being declared sane by their doctors because the hospital wants more profit, or because of existing prejudice. I can already see the headlines now: “Cured black man denied gun ownership by racist doctor”. 

We can’t just deny possible, feasible, and realistic ripple effects of policy as being “slippery slope” arguments. They are there and have to be considered. And unfortunately, I can certainly say that I would never trust any government, no matter its leadership or make-up, with that level of control over such an important issue. They will mishandle something, and with a matter so large, a mishandling can not truly be afforded. Until I can see a comprehensive, feasible, and genuinely effective policy for gun control, whose down stream effects are considered, accounted for, and/or mitigated, I could never truly say I’m in favor of gun control. At most, I fervently support a requirement for (subsidized!) training and certification.
My point is that what if the Trump administration includes homosexuality as a "mental illness" or something like that. Also many people would avoid treatment out of fear of losing their rights.
That while it's tragic that things like this happen, trivializing it down to a snip like "Good thing this family had a gun to keep them safe" is the same snip as "Good thing this family had a car to get them to school" if there were a tragic automobile accident. This uneducated and reckless demonization of a free peoples only tool to protect their 
 families and fellow man against tyranny and oppression is disgusting to me. This person clearly had mental issues that should have been dealt with, this stories main character is not the firearm.

If you can truly sit there and wonder what the purpose of a firearm is in modern society then you need to open your eyes to what modern society really is. There is no evil in 99.999 percent of people that own a firearm, and no evil in 100% of firearms.
He does no damage.
Mental health services are the solution.
While I understand the point of your first statement, I doubt in a domestic case like this the mother would have the stones to *shoot at her own son.* I'm not saying that's right, I'm just saying most people will hesitate or outright be unable to use such lethal forms (especially if not trained) on loved ones.
That boy needs therapy.
My mom is a drug addict and threatens to kill herself if I don't wire her money. At this point I just tell her that if she thinks killing herself is the best option then I'm not going to tell her not to so it.
The problem with that is that most people would never forgive themselves if that person does that.
Yeah I agree, but my mom doesn’t. It’s hard on her. 

And my mom took his computer away once, but he pinned her to a wall and held a knife to her and now my mom is too afraid to take anything away from him and upset him. 
We did exactly this. It's been ten years, and we can't believe how wonderful life has been since we forced his hand. 
> We had one of those.

Jesus... You seem very callous about it. I bet that had nothing to do with it though.
You don't help them. You can't help someone that doesn't want to help themselves. You can stop enabling them. 


Is this problem new? Was he once a well adjusted adult? Or have these problems been going on for years since he was still a teen or younger?  


I wouldn't flat out call your parents shitty, but they likely have been avoiding a huge problem for way too long.


If your parents cant discipline because they are afraid for their lives, they can't fix the situation. They have lost all control. 


It's not a matter of if your brother hurts himself or someone, it's when. 


An intervention has to happen. Professional help is needed. 



Does he have positive interactions with anyone? Does he leave the house? What would happen if you invited him to hang out?
???????????? I just said, take away his video games. What's he going to do, print money from thin air? You give your child motivation by causing him a level of pain that doesn't disintegrate his will to live. Is this just a blank space in parents heads, are you a parent? IF so, tell me why it's inconceivable for you to take the child's video games. 
Asking the hard questions... never ever change reddit
i dont know if this is a joke or not but this man was not healthy. it obviously wasnt about stupid headphones.there was something much deeper to this.
another coworker of my gf’s and his was really close to him but lost touch when he left work due to health issues. when my gf notified the other coworker about the news, she was in shock because she hadnt heard from him in awhile. the coworker probably feels terrible because she thought about contacting him last week to see how he was doing but it just happened to slip her mind. she’s probably gonna feel at fault because she feels she couldve reached out to him just  to see how he was doing. this man was in a downward spiral battling depression and he had been drinking alot. sometimes a phone call is all it takes  to let people know that they are loved and cared about.
beats by dr dre i bet
Prolly some Turtle Beach, ugh. 
It's not a news story unless they follow the easy scapegoat.
I dunno.  I mean, they bring up in most reports this was the second time the police had been called on the guy threatening his parents in 6 months.
that was based off from the first and only time i met him.
I totally agree. He might not fit the diagnostic criteria of any particular  mental illness. My point is that if somebody is that much of an asshole, there's probably something wrong with them, and raising them differently is unlikely to have made a difference. They would have ended up a huge impulsive asshole no matter what.

I think that is certainly true in some cases. The parents aren't always to blame. In this particular case, we don't have enough information to say for sure.
You can't blame mental illnesses on parents, man.  MagicPistol without mental illness is MagicPistol, perfectly good person.

MagicPistol raised in the exact same environment but add paranoid schizophrenia or other mental illness that takes hold as he heads into his 30's, making him very unpredictable, increasingly prone to delusions or fits?  Complete wildcard, and not in any way the parents fault.
Not violent like this dude, but they were a few times where I blew up and yelled back at my mom over stupid shit. Even now, I can get really frustrated over her nagging.

Downvotes because you won’t recognize your true ultimate powers.
Haha. No, wasn’t implying that. I was confirming what you said. I meant whoever wrote the article might not understand Central California. 
Good for you? But can you see that not everyone makes a lot? I graduated with a liberal arts degree and made $30k/year, couldnt pay it. had roommates but the places that i lived were always shit. At home i had a different life. I was no longer budgeting, i bought a used lotus, made financially irresponsible decisions, because i had $1800 surplus every month. Life. Was good.
Make 6 figures before youre 30 then talk to me about mooching. I can do that because i have no debt and never had to live poor. 
> Where's the consideration for your parents?

I basically had to escape from my parents house because they didn't want me to move out so bad ha. I have a sort of best friend relationship with my father so he sort of felt like his friend was leaving. I love my parents dearly, but I had to make my own footing in life (still trying lol) and plus, you know, girls. 

Some parents can't wait till there kids move out, some don't ever want them too. 
[removed]
Lol if you expect your kids to visit often and to take good care of you when youre old and lonely, dont call them mooches. I plan to set aside half of my paycheck for when my mums need a caretaker, medical, and other old people expenses. Cant do that if im tied up in funds now
Who said anything about on their own? That's what roommates are for.
Moving back in with your parents due to unforseen financial circumstances or living with them until your financial situation improves is one thing. Just living with your parents with no plans to move out eventually or not giving back in some way to them for letting you stay there as an adult is another.
You save every Euro.. so you dont buy groceries? Dont help out by paying for the internet you use? I bet you're still on your parents health insurance plan too. You're a man child with a skewed preception of the world. 
Is that the culture in Northern California?
Dont be a douche. You said you have a well paying job. Living away from yoir parents is more than just saving money, you twat.
good for you. I am trying to illustrate that a lot of jobs out there simply do not support living on your own. People get sick. People get into car accidents, or have their home lit on fire. Some people have to take care of sick family. Not everyone can go to college and make 6 figures. To judge someone for living at home in this country, in this economy is just ignorant of what the real world is like. Fuck you I got mine, right?
Maybe, but that's conjecture.  

Killing someone with a gun is pretty easy, easier than your other options.

Pretty sure anti trumpers and liberals are guilty of that too...like screaming "racism" and then turns out you punched yourself in the face and wrote racial slurs on your own car and tried to blame the "racists"....

I think people who work for their 30,000 40 hours at a time and pay that chunk of taxes mentally accept taxation easier than some young kid who programs well, earns 200k off of a gig, and loses 40% of that to taxes and other shite he didn't plan for. Gets butthurt that he only has 140k at the end of it.
New York is pretty similar in that regard. 
They also believe the high taxes in California are because of the welfare queens.
"Nice Strawman" and then says "you people on the left". Stop pretending all conservatives are on your side of the immigration argument. I'm tired of being forced to side with Democrats because of your shitty opinions. 
You sure, angry [gamers](https://qz.com/901761/donald-trump-and-steve-bannon-are-using-gamergate-culture-to-attract-angry-white-men/) are Trump's [troll army](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/).
That won't stop me from quoting Mike "Curing Queers with Amperes" Pence's many nicknames
Honestly, it was a flimsy attempt to just point out that particular hypocrisy among conservatives, but it's kind of a hypocrisy on both sides when you consider it from both angles. It could even more easily be turned around to say "So then you support those restrictions on abortion, and agree its tantamount to gun violence?". The 2 subjects are related by a similar opinion held by the opposite side in each case; Democrats/Republicans want to prevent the unnecessary deaths of civlians/babies(or fetuses, whatever your personal terminology be), respectively. I'm not sure it was the best way to get someone to see from my perspective on either issue. My bad.
I don't really understand why many people think it is so important that they should have the absolute right to own a gun. Because you can use it to defend yourself? You can also defend yourself without a gun. Because you don't want the government to be able to tell you what to do? Guess what, in a lot of contexts they already do...and it's not *always* such a bad thing. 

Just saying, a lot of people consider owning a gun to be some all-important god-given human right...it's not, we just happen to allow people to own and (largely) to run wild with guns in this country. And honestly that's fine, it just seems to me that as a result of a culture that celebrates guns in this way, a lot of people really don't have any respect for what a gun truly is and can do. Like you said, we really should have required training and certification - and IMO, you should fail and not be allowed to own one if you screw around during the training and don't take it seriously. Maybe more people would understand that guns aren't something cool or some kind of toy, and they would realize that owning one is more of a *privilege* and not a *right*, even in America.
The slippery slope argument can be applied to basically every debate like this. Every policy we have could be described as being on a slippery slope. 

Trump or any other administration could fuck up almost every law and policy and destroy our rights. It's a useless argument in 99% of cases.
The attack is ineffective!
Yeah, that's why I said it's a complicated world. Who knows what good a gun really would have done. Obviously "on paper" and "hindsight being 20/20" a gun is what she would have needed, but a lot of factors play into these types of things.

I think the downvotes are coming from people who just read "GUNS HELP PEOPLE SOMETIMES" and got upset. 
Purely psychosomatic.
Yeah, you really have to call their bluff. You hope for the best, but if it happens, then, well, it happens.
The correct response is "I'm sorry you aren't feeling well. Here are numbers for the suicide hotline or I can call 911 if you need help now." After that, ghost them. 

I had an ex-friend pull that shit on me. I told her I was calling 911 and suddenly she felt a lot better. 
I've made my peace with it. The fact is, once you've heard it a thousand times, it loses all meaning.
WTF? Get the police to escort him away, a restraining order, etc. Call the suicide bluff, he probably won't do it.
Call the cops.  He might end up killing your mom.

Why are you assuming that hasn’t been tried already? It has and it resulted in him grabbing a kitchen knife and threatening my mom. My parents would need to have police escorts come to the house, and my mom just can’t bring herself to do that because she’d feel responsible if anything were to happen to him. 
Lets face it whatever company that made those cheap easy to break headphones are the real villain in this story. 
So maybe Sennheisers?
That's the real crime here.
Oooo this hits deep. As someone who was diagnoised with mild schizophrenia at a young age, I worry about losing grip on reality during bouts of depression. Even still, I contribute a large part of my ability to control delusional anger to my parents. 

I think upbringing has a large part of how people with illnesses cope, however I am inclined to agree with your point. You never know which way this stuff can swing.
Not everyone enjoys the power of spontaneous diarrhea 
I don't make a lot right now, but I live with my wife so it's like having a roommate but more personal 
Does your mom still pack your lunches? 
Right, so first you lived at home because 

>it makes no sense to waste half your paycheck on rent just so you have a place to sleep

and

>it's definitely nicer, but not all of us can afford that luxury.

But now you "make six figures" and "have no debt."

Okay guy, whatever you say, LOL!

Be sure and link me to a video of your brand new Porsche!


I don't get it.
If I have to have roommates, I'd rather it be family who will have my back and I already know how to live with rather than finding people on Craigslist.  
But when you say "everyone who stays with their parents is pathetic," you have to realize that that is encompassing a ton of people. Most of us aren't happy we're living with our parents and being made to feel like losers doesn't make it better.

Yes because the media has never been wrong about gamers or video games before oh wait I got that backwards they've never been right. Fuck off it was bullshit when the right was calling pokemon satanic and this is just as bullshit.
[removed]
I’ll keep it simple, since the person before already mentioned the notion of a great equalizer, but another purpose of the second amendment was an enshrinement of a right to revolution. Should a government, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, “become destructive of these ends [Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.”

Is this a radical notion? Yes. But if times come that the populace is willing to openly uprise *en masse* against the government, the idea is that everyone has the ability to bear arms and take action. Many have argued that a perfect example of a driving event behind the enshrining of the Second Amendment was the events in Concord and Lexington, wherein the British government attempted to seize weaponry they had declared illegal; had this attempted seizure of weaponry been successful and widespread, the Patriots would have been neutered in their ability to revolt. There’s a reason the Second Amendment also talks about having militias.

Now is the Common Joe and Jane with their 9mm going to be able to stand against Billy Yank and his M16 and Anti-Personnel rounds? Likely not. But we should recall that the Taliban, al-Queda, and Da’esh have been fighting against the modern American military with outdated equipment either ransacked from underfunded military installations, or left to rot in the sand by the Soviets and other nations. They’ve been on the backfoot, sure, but they’ve resisted for years, nearly decades now. The average American may not be able to buy an RPG, but they can buy semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, hunting rifles, and handguns that would put most insurgent arsenals to shame. Add that in to the fact that a sizeable portion of the American military would likely defect in such a hypothetical situation, and suddenly the playing field is a lot more level, particularly if any foreign powers lended a bit of aid like France did back in the American Revolution. 

This, of course, an extreme fantasy, a doomsday scenario. But when we look at history and even at nations around the world today, to say that “it can’t happen here” is beyond naive. So the primary purpose of a gun? Self-defense, equalizing of individuals. Secondary? Hunting and self-sufficiency for those who choose. But thirdly? Creating the notion of a revolution to be possible, if unlikely. 

There are plenty of downsides, but I’m of the mind that, despite how terrible they can be, they are part of the cost of freedom. We should try to mitigate them to the best of our ability, but they will always be the hard cost we pay. It’s radical, it’s fantastical, but you can’t just pray and hope for optimism when it comes to government. Income tax was *3%* at inception, and that was called crazy, but everyone figured it’d never get too unreasonable. Not to say income tax is inherently bad or non-essential today, but it’s a perfect example of “give ‘em an inch and they’ll take a mile.”

So to sum it up, it’s not *owning a gun* that’s the right, it’s what owning a gun *allows* that is a right. 
It's the same reason why voter ID laws are such a bad idea.
> Every policy we have could be described as being on a slippery slope.

Yes, and it's why we have to be cautious when looking to add restrictions to any rights.  "What could our opponents do with this power," is something we should always ask ourselves when attempting to give the government more power.

You say it's a useless argument, but your comment overall supports the argument.
What does that mean?
Right. But it’s not my house so I don’t think it’s legal for me to kick someone out of property that’s not mine. It’s up to my parents and my mom doesn’t want to do that because she insists that it will only lead to his death. 
call the bluff, kick the jerk out, get that restraining order... but I wouldn't call the police unless mom and dad's dog was an emotionally abusive asshole, too
You're mom is part of the problem. She's codependent on your brother. If you think he's actually going to kill your mom for taking away his video games, yes the police need to get involved, and if your mom doesn't do it, she's a major contributor to the worsening psychology of your brother. Hell, if you really believe your brother would butcher your mother with a knife, he's only going to get worse over the years as he holds your family hostage with a knife. 

THis is way different than most overprotected over sheltered millenials who aren't going to slaughter their family if you take their video games away.

But I think in all probable reality your brother will do nothing, and you need to call his bluff. But no one really cares about HIM in your family. Codependency isn't about your brother, but your narcissistic mother who is trying to heal some deep psychological wound in herself.
i think they were skullcandy

What's the big deal compared to "buy USA" slogans?
Correct me if I'm wrong on this and please forgive any ignorance I might have on the issue, but from what I've read from the article he's encouraging the citizens of Venezuela to eat healthy, abstain from drugs and alcohol.  So what I'm wondering is why would promoting fruit juice over soda be a bad thing if it was all natural?  I prefer juice over soda and it seems that if it's natural it wouldn't be as bad.  Yes I am aware that there is sugar in juice but aren't they better for you than say cane sugar or corn syrup?
At least he's promoting a healthy lifestyle, but still his hatred for US companies can be detected even in the stratosphere.

How is sugary garbage food not socialism? The only reason it is so profitable is massive subsidies.
How is that sensible?

Consumers should be able to drink whatever brand they want to. If Coca-Cola or Pepsi is what someone wants to drink, then that person should be able to drink it. If the state owned fruit juice company really wants to compete then they should make a competent final product. And if a product is competent, there should be no need for saying, "Hey please buy this lesser desired product and feel bad for us because we make an incompetent product that can't sell itself."
I totally agree. I don't understand those saying juice is just as bad as coke because it contains sugars too. As far as I know sugars are needed in quite large quantities just to survive. Plus fruit juice has vitamins which soda usually lacks.
He's Venezuelan. His birthright does not require him to enjoy *any* foreign influence. 

It's no different here in America. Do you know how many people here hate Chinese companies right now? Can you imagine the backlash if you were to tell any of those people to just suck it up?
Was about to say the same thing.  Fruit juice might sound good but it's still Basicly sugar water.
He's not forcing anybody to drink anything. He gave advice which, if followed, may improve the health and wealth of his country. He did so while on the national stage. This kind of dialogue is usually called "leadership".

"Hey guys, I know you like your soda pop, but the juice we make here at home is better for you and puts some of your neighbors to work."

I don't see the issue.

Edit: Stop downvoting him you hivemind dipshits.
Rather drink fruit juice than soda any damn day, despite the fact I mostly drink water. Fuck coke n pepsi.

It's not that it's mostly water it's that they both contain boat loads of sugar.  Drinking sugar water is bad for u no matter if it comes from soda or juice.  

Hugo isn't doing any real service saying drink juice instead of soda.

If kids stopped drinking soda and started drinking as much juice they'd be just as fat.
Well I'll just say this, you can pour coca-cola on a grease stain on your driveway, and it'll clean it, let's see some apple juice do that. Not to mention soft drinks have chemicals in them to suppress you from gagging, from oversweetness.

In any case, this isn't a problem for me, I drink mostly water. I do indulge in the occasional juice from time to time(make it myself from fresh fruits), which I much rather consume, over anything with high fructose corn syrup(most sodas, and a lot of "juices").
I've been drinking large quantities of fruit juice all my life. I am not overweight. Sugar exists in many types and is essential for humans to survive. The motto "all sugars are bad" is false.
[deleted]
I never claimed you will or will not become fat by drinking this or that. You did.

You want to cast doubt on my statement that sugars are essential for humans?
Well they are diet versions of the original drink, also you better have some damn good attorneys to go up against Coke and Pepsi with something as tedious as this
Money talks when it come to government lobbiest's. diet soda is an oxymoron. Like jumbo shrimp and pretty ugly.
That's ridiculous. Diet soda has less than 5 calories per serving. How is that not "diet"?
How is that diet?
Its SODA. Its not food. It is a treat. It isnt required to sustain life. 
I wonder how many fatties out there drink a bunch of it and thinks there is no negative impact
[deleted]
Well no shit, it's not the only thing I'm eating. Diet soda is also like 99% water. You can drink just diet soda and get all the daily water you need from it. And no, diet soda isn't a "treat". Regular sugar soda should be considered a treat. Diet soda is literally just flavored carbonated water with caffeine. Or if you're like me and drink caffeine free diet coke, no caffeine at all.
I am one of those fatties that drink caffeine free diet coke because I like the taste of it and it's certainly better than drinking full on sugar loaded coke.
What makes that fit the definition of the word diet 
So your addicted to it. Maybe you need help
I hate Diet Coke but I like Coke Zero. I wonder what the difference is
That's cute
Tell me what you think is addicting about *Caffeine Free* Diet Coke.
I've heard a rumor that Diet Coke is based on the "New Coke" recipe while Coke Zero is based off the "Coke Classic" recipe. Kinda doubt its true, but I've heard it said lol. 
Same foe my boyfriend but that's because I managed to get him to switch from straight coke to coke zero.
It's funny because you're implying that he's being pretentious while being even more pretentious yourself! I get it!
Isn't that like exactly what the Wikipedia says about it?
This is an advertisement, not news.
Hoping for a return of Crystal Gravy also. :P
I've never had a chance to try this flavor.  Can't wait! 
Or it is news of the return of a product
I would like to see it on selves again. 
The [gravy](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/crystal-gravy/n10459) is the real story.
the only time I saw someone drink clear pepsi, they puked into a bucket in the back of a bus. 
"Mmm, invisible cola!" -- Homer Simpson.
I want them to bring it back...

Right now

Hey, its your tomorrow

Right now
Pepsi just all around sucks
LA Beast!!!!! He's behind all of this.... check his youtube out at skippy62able Lots of funny videos of him puking 20 year old crystal pepsi
It's not really that they're introducing a new product line. This is just a small-run movie memorabilia trinket like millions of others.
Yeah let's just make the coolest thing ever and then not make enough. 
I'm waiting for the re-release of Coke with coke. 
Very disappointed at this. Was hoping for a new flavor. :(
I thought this was in Pepsi Throwback already, which I love?  Oh well, bring it on.  It'll be like when I was a kid and that'll work for me.
*"There are some consumers who seem to gravitate to "sugar," though in reality high fructose corn syrup is also an excellent sweetener," says Sicher."*

We're not questioning the sweetness of the product, you tit.
how bout that toxic caramel coloring? 
Finally! Maybe this can start a chain to end the use of that nasty HFCS...and no I'm not some green nut. I just hate the taste, texture and after taste of HFCS. Dx
The article does not address the cost of ingredients. I know corn prices and futures are high, how does corn syrup compare to the market price of sugar? I think Pepsi is switching because sugar is a cheaper ingredient not a better ingredient.
>Replacing high fructose corn syrup with another type of sugar will have little effect on obesity and diabetes, says Hari. "It's like replacing a cigarette with a cigar."

Right and people who drink Pepsi regularly don't do it for the health benefits.  A cigar is better tasting and is enjoyed more than a cigarette.  Cigar smokers don't smoke cigars for less health risks.  I drink Pepsi.  I will drink with "Real Sugar" because it tastes different and better.  I just wish they could do it in glass instead of plastic.
They're adding Vanilla and Wild Cherry Pepsi and I guess re-branding throwback
But without it, cola would be green... Or is that just Coke?

I know I read that odd factoid somewhere... But yeah- Caramel coloring and artificial color use in general needs to be reevaluated in the US. 
I think they're switching to actual sugar because people are asking for it and the Pepsi and Mt. Dew "Throwback" sold so well.  I don't think they're removing the Pepsi with HFCS, they're just making another line of "Pepsi, made with real sugar" line.  Again, not sure on prices but I know that the extremely lower cost of HFCS was why they started it to begin with (Or at least the lower cost over actual cane sugar).
I liked the vanilla pepsi too.  All sounds real good now, thanks!
>Six thousand five hundred bottles of the soda will be made available

Looks like I won't be getting one of these, I'm sure they will be all overpriced on eBay by the dawn of the 22nd. 
So far no URL has been given on where to buy it but people are guessing 4:29 pm, the exact time Doc, Marty, and Jennifer arrive in 2015 to save Marty Jr. from Griff.
I just want Josta back.
To hell with Pepsi until they bring back the old Diet Pepsi formula.
Might be some of the best product placement the company ever payed for
im hoping amazon gets the license to sell them. i may get lucky and get one with my prime account. 
Give me a bottle of Orbitz any day!
Best of luck to you, I hope you get one!

I'm just happy they exist, if I get to see one that'd be neat but no sweat if not. 
He's a bit late to the party.
Aren't there supposed to be settlements with gag orders, or are these new cases?
I love Michael Jackson's music. I went to the victory tour in 1985. I had his posters on my bedroom wall. I dreamt of dancing and singing like him ever since I can remember. Even though I admire his talent, I firmly believe that he had inappropriate relationships with little boys. I guess we'll never know definitively, but come on, "Jesus juice?" I can totally picture him saying that.
It's crazy I grew up in the eighties/nineties and MJ was the bomb. Then he was weird but still awesome. Then he was just fucking weird. Then it was just kinda sad. I don't remember exactly when he *became* a pedophile but he obviously always was one. This new guy is a year older than me, I even remember the Pepsi ad with him dancing and thinking *how awesome to be a TV star, dance like that, meet Michael Jackson* dodged a real bullet growing up in the middle of nowhere.
New cases. This Robson guy testified *for* the defense in a previous MJ trial. Says he was coached.
There is to this day not a shred of evidence that MJ was a pedophile. And remember that during his life there were two investigations, and a 10 year FBI probe that yielded no evidence to support the claims.

Also remember that the people involved in this convenient lawsuit have defended MJ the entire time he was alive, they had two opportunities to tell authorities what "happened"(both as kids, AND as adults) both were interviewed by authorities. 
Wade has already been proven to have lied about his case, which he brought up a year ago, hoping that it would result in a settlement from the estate. Now he has recruited another, conveniantly the day before MJ has a new album release. 

If you believe this cash grab is legit then wow. 
He's definitely lying, I followed the MJ trial, he volunteered himself to defend MJ, and not only that but he was the first defense witness. He testified as an adult, mind you. 
There were many kids who defended MJ during the investigations. Why would MJ bring in as his first witness, someone he had supposedly molested for years. It's clearly bullshit, cash grab.
If the estate doesn't settle I guess there will be an open trial and they will present their case.  
These guys are unreal! Wade's career hit the skids after he spent years pursuing failed film projects instead of accepting the numerous choreography jobs that came his way. Wade's underlying complaint revolves around MJ prophesying that he was going to be a director bigger than Steven Spielberg. So because Wade failed at directing decades later, it must all be MJ's fault! Better toss in a molestation scandal for good measure, without that his written complaint would seem completely mental. He also had a private BBQ with MJ and family in Vegas in 2008, filmed one of his only completed short films at Neverland in 2007, and wrote a very touching tribute to MJ in the Opus after MJ died in 2009 where he said how he could never bare to remove MJ's phone messages cause of what a friend he was. Oh and he was gonna be the lead star in the Cirque Du Soleil show in 2010-11 but they ultimately picked Travis Pain instead (whom has become a far more prominent Choreographer than Wade).

This new accuser makes even less sense to me, especially since any and all statute of limitations would have long since expired since MJ DIED FOUR YEARS AGO!  He's the same guy the prosecution tossed around as a victim since the 1990s based on tabloid reports. Based on the same witnesses who were proven to have committed perjury and other forms of fraud during the '93 and '03 cases and who crumbled under cross-examination when testifying in 2005.  

I guess since they have "collaborative witnesses", however unbelievable, they feel they may have a shot of getting some money from the estate.
Well if he isn't lying he is at least a fucking asshole for throwing the other guys case to the dogs.
There is likely not going to be a trial because Wade's claim has long exceeded the statute of limitations. According to California law, you have to take any claims against an estate within 60 days of learning about the existence of the estate. He has to prove that he didn't know the estate existed until now. 

Wade claimed he didn't know there was an estate all these years, but that is a lie, because he worked on a project with them called Michael Jackson Opus, in which he wrote this really loving and praiseful tribute to him. He then was auditioning and competing for various choreographing jobs for the estate, but lost the job to [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_King). Oddly enough, in the midst of all this MJ related stuff, his apparent "abuse memories" were not triggered. 

His actual claim is hilarious, he claims a "prophecy" revealed that he was actually abused. 
Well Gavin Arvizo in 2005 was about the least credible sex abuse accuser in history. There were even reporters who sat in on the trial who went in thinking MJ was a pedo, and even they did not believe Gavin was molested and were surprised his case even got to trial. 

That being said, Wade is about as inconsistent as they come. He first claimed in his files that he had repressed memory (which is a pseudo science that does not hold in court, it actually had a history of getting people falsely convicted), then, he went on TV saying that it wasn't repressed memory and that he never forgot any of it, he just didn't know it was abuse. (Which is absurd, considering he was an adult when he defended MJ,and was questioned. He saw the trial, he would have known it was wrong, and if he didn't, then he would have told what happened to him because in his eyes it wasn't wrong). 

With this kind of inconsistency, it's very hard to put credibility into a person like that. Also the fact that he claimed he didn't know there was an estate so that's why his claim is late, even though he worked on projects with the estate in the years following MJ's death. So he lied about that too.

He's also asking for millions, claiming he can never work in his field again so he needs basically a lifetime compensation. 

He has sold interviews and dirt to TMZ and other tabloids, in an apparent effort to scare the Estate into settlement, since his claim will likely not pass into trial. 

Anyways, the point is that Wade's case is far from credible. It's very sick too, to do this when MJ has three children who can see all this fuckery. 

It would be pretty awful if they were liars who were ruining their dead ex friend's reputation for a big payout.  I have no idea what the truth is.  If it does go to trial it'll be interesting.
Well this all sounds very good and I actually believe you because I can't be bothered to cross check the facts you've given me. If it makes you feel any better my kids and I all stop and dance and sing like idiots to all MJ/Jackson5 songs immediately upon hearing them  :)
Oh I really wish that this was going to trial. I want them to bring Jordan Chandler from 1993 on the stand, and everyone who was involved with the allegations against MJ (It goes pretty deep, much deeper then the general public is aware of). Jordan escaped testifying over and over again, even in 2005 as an adult when he was asked by the prosecution to testify , (he threatened legal action if they forced him to). 

The smartest thing the first accuser (or his family on his behalf) ever did was avoid testifying against MJ. That way the claims went unchallenged legally, which opened the door for the other accusers. 
If these people were brought to court they would be obliterated. There is so much evidence against them, I mean look how Gavin's case was obliterated in 2005. People would finally be aware of how BS these allegations are. 

Sadly I don't think it's going to go to trial, because it's probably not going to pass the statutes. 
I find this confusing.

Why would a soft drink plant have a duffel bag worth of cash on hand?
Who could possibly know that a soft drink manufacturing plant had that cash on hand?

This seems right out of a corny spy novel.
"He is described as a black male between the ages of 35 and 40 years old. He is around 5-foot-6 and weighs approximately 180 pounds."

That narrows it down, should be easy to find him now.
Did they get the hockey mask at least?
He was wearing Pepsi clothing?

I'd wager that wasn't a disguise and he's more likely a disgruntled former employee.
Eh, more of a coca-cola guy anyways.
> He is described as a **black male** between the ages of 35 and 40 years old. He is around 5-foot-6 and weighs approximately 180 pounds.

Thank goodness no one shot the thief, otherwise we will have protests for months about him being a good kid. They will put up childhood photos of him from the 1980's claiming that the racist Pepsi worker shot an innocent child. It worked for Mike Brown and he was caught on security camera robbing a place. Now every other idiot thinks he was a hero.

Petty cash drawer. Guy has to be a disgruntled former employee that knew something. If it's a vending machine distributor, it might be a cash exchange.
Maybe they were buying coke?
You think this description is weak, but I have seen much worse.  In fact it is pretty normal for Detroit newspapers to completely omit the race of the suspect.  I mean, why even bother trying to describe suspects if you intentionally leave out on of the most important charateristics.
And they said black people don't steal.
Dude, what the hell, seriously?

It's Detroit. I live here. You think black people don't get shot here? By police? Of both colors?

Have you *HEARD* of Detroit?

So this is Obama's America...
*puts gun in mouth*
I've always had Pepsi at the Costcos in my area. :(
CHEEBURGER CHEEBURGER CHEEBURGER...cheeburger?
I'd rather have no drink if it means I'll have to drink a Pepsi with my hot dog. EW PEPSI. Oh well, at least my diabetes will go away. 
Pepsi is better.
I don't want to live on this planet any more. 
If only it were sugar. 
THANKS OBAMA. 
Obama's America won't let you have that gun, so better do it quick :P
in the food court? 
heresy!
I'm with you buddy!
syrup is sugar, by definition 
Yep. We even have mtn dew as an option. Never coke, though.
Sugar is a type of sucrose. When people say sugar, they mean Cane Sugar, not Corn syrup sugar. HFCS is a mix of glucose and fructose. 

So, no, Syrup is not sugar.
If only it weren't corn syrup. 
This gives me hope
It's smaller than 5.7", so of course it's a budget phone.
This would be because tracking/selling your data would generate more revenue than their carbonated corn syrup sales.
Pepsi makes the Pepsi Clear of cell phones!

So the "Is Pepsi OK?" question will now be supplemented with the "Is Android OK?" question.
This kinda just blew my stoned mind 
Does this mean Coke will sell its own brand of New Coke phones a la Android?
Disclaimer: *This advertisement has been brought to you by the proud makers of Coca-cola.*
Is Pepsi Max still safe?
>PepsiCo also cited data stating that most consumers drink less than a third of a 12-ounce can of soda per day

So, Pepsi is not warning you that its product is poisonous because it only expects you to drink  1/3 of a can of Pepsi a day.

Show of hands, Pepsi drinkers, were any of you aware that you were supposed to only drink a third of a can a day? I guess  you just discard 2/3 of each can?

This is the worst kind of corporate doublespeak ever. They should be ashamed.
Well then, looks like I'll be adding Pepsi One to the list of soda's not to buy...

All of them
Just a side note - they were selling 12 packs for $2 at the local store. It all makes sense now...
How did we get to a place where we have acceptable levels of *carcinogens* in our foods?  And why is only California doing something about not poisoning people for profit.
The chemical is 4-methylimidazole, or 4-Mel, which can form during the cooking process and, as a result, may be found in trace amounts in many foods.

Watchdog group The Center for Environmental Health found via testing that while Coke products no longer test positive for the chemical, Pepsi products sold outside of California still do.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/03/group-finds-carcinogen-in-pepsi/2485643/


Risk analysis. You can study the probably impact at a given dosage. 
There isn't much evidence to suggest that the chemical causes cancer, one study with rats is hardly convincing.
oxfam is a great organization and this is a great idea...
And Coke has been used to clean grime and rust off of metal. While I agree that soda should be a treat and not an everyday beverage; the way our digestive system treats it is much different. 
Stomach acid could also dissolve a mouse carcass, but we don't think it is dangerous to our digestive system.
Pepsi cleans wind shields.

Not sure as to why people would even drink this crap anyways.
Watch out Jerry...watch out. 
TBH it probably would. Have you seen what carbonated drinks can do? Why do you think dentists hate them?
So if I drink enough Mountain Dew, I can move my way up to more acidic fare? I will become immune to the effects of acid (when digested).
Once I accutally used Coca-Cola to dissolve the rubber seal on an oil filter that got stuck when attempting to change it out
Our stomachs literally eat acid for breakfast. It isn't the digestive system that has an issue with Coke.
As someone who suffers from GERD, I disagree.
Yes. I suggest starting with about 5 two liter bottles of Mountain Dew a day. With that regiment you should be about to drink 6M HCl Within the month.

Hasn't this been the case outside the US for years/forever? The UK bottle of 'diet Pepsi' in front of me lists "sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame K)"  exactly the same as the bottle of 'diet coke'. I don't think I've seen aspartame used without acesulfame in the UK. Is this a big deal?
It's cola, it's not like a 12 year old scotch. 
Yes, in Australia we call it *Pepsi Next.*
They were pretty open about it, its been in the market for 3.. 4 months?
Seriously, it's soda. I'm all about transparency, but I'm not asking for a press release whenever a recipe changes.

"HEY THIS DUDE'S CHANGING SWEETENER OVER HERE"
Not really. It is the same here in Sweden, and I would assume across the rest of Europe. 
??  Not the same.  Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Next are two separate things.  Diet Pepsi is 0 calorie, Pepsi Next is low calorie...something like 60 per serving?  There is also sugar-free Pepsi Max.

But seriously 
If the bacteria can eat PE/XLPE or PVC, it could really mess up some infrastructure in the wild.
Isn't this how apocalyptic scifi novels start?
There will still be a by-product, it'll be the same story in 20 years with the new challenge of atomized plastic saturating the oceans and making the fishes sick.  Sounds great at first read but the guy whose project involves scooping it up (sorry, no link) is a better sounding plan as he plans to gather and sell the by-product.
This has already been done many many times.
Although this seems like good news, it's the 40th "plastic eating bacteria/microbes" news story I've seen in the last 10 years so I won't hold my breath.
I certainly hope whatever microbe we end up with to get rid of all our plastic is only used in a tank. If they let these things loose on the planet, we'll have a real\-life disaster movie on our hands. 
Uh oh. I mean yay?
PET is only the tip of the iceberg. We are pumping out plastics and complex polymers used in everything from fabrics to consumer electronics that just don't degrade. They'll be broken down into tiny pieces, but no organism on Earth would ever be capable of mutating in a way that'll allow it to digest these materials. And even then...

>right now it takes months for the bacteria to significantly degrade PET
The andromeda strain was with us all along, we just had to believe!
I thought this would be done with a gene splicing texhnique.
This is not a good idea.  Last time someone tried something like this they bred a bacteria that could've eaten all plant life if released.  It was supposed to help produce compost.
This is the way the world ends

This is the way the world ends

This is the way the world ends

Not with a bang but a lipase
Either great environmental potental...or end of the world shit.
News: microbes that eat plastic have mutated into microbes that eat everything.
Some day they might run out of plastic to eat and they will starve. This is unethical.
This is not new. A bunch of labs all over the world are working to breed bacteria/fungi that can degrade plastic. This is just an excuse for Reed College to let the world know they exist
Dump a couple gallons of that stuff on a porn star and watcher her melt.
What does Communism, Atheism and Free Love create? Plastic eating microbes.

I do have a slight curiosity to what else it COULD eat, if it can eat plastics. 
This. If this shit can not just subsist, but *thrive* on plastic, it'll essentially destroy the modern world. 
Just add nylon and PET to the list and everyone will be naked. 
No, not in the wild. The wild doesn't have man made infrastructure
it's also how the comic based on the original pitch for sliders starts. it's called doorways and the first planet they land on is a dimension where all oil was destroyed by a microbe designed to eat plastic.
Yes, specifically 'Andromeda Strain'. 
Yes. Ill Wind starts off almost exactly this way. 
> There will still be a by-product, it'll be the same story in 20 years with the new challenge of atomized plastic saturating the oceans and making the fishes sick.

Yes, and no. Yes, there will be a by-product. No, the by-product is not necessarily going to be harmful in all contexts. Keep in mind, shit is a by-product, but plants aboslutely love shit. 
"Atomized plastic" isn't a thing, btw. 
>atomized plastic saturating the oceans and making the fishes sick

Nah, we already got that. The project here is designed to help fix that. 
There's a mercury by-product of fish, and plenty other human created and consumed products that make people sick. Yet, I should be worried about fish?

Where do the priorities lie? Like rich people complaining to the homeless about lawnmower problems. 
So many pipes. Only the pipes would be a disaster. Which would be a shame because I wish it could solve the ocean plastic issue.
It's a good thing l. Not a long term solution, but it'll probably clean up the place a bunch for now
They always ask "is Pepsi ok?" but never how the Pepsi is feeling ;-;
Pepsi > Coke
A different time before unlimited plastics and glass from overseas.

Ok, but what does it SHIT?
Probably all the normal stuff other bacteria eats. Chances are it doesn't eat plastic unless it has no other, easier food source. 
Article greatly exaggerates, at the very end there's a little note that it takes them months to degrade even PET, and this is under ideal conditions where the bacteria have no other carbon source and I'd assume they were also given a steady supply of other nutrients and moisture.  In normal environmental conditions these sorts of bacteria will typically either find something better to eat or struggle to actually survive on plastic without someone there to feed them all the other stuff they need.

We've had bacteria that we know can degrade plastics and other long-lasting organic compounds for over a decade now, but no one has really been able to get them to do anything practical.
And leave no artifacts for the next resurgent population. 
It would be kind of cool to have a wooden computer though! 
let's just throw the dice and see what happens? wait, dice are plastic, aren't they??
It does do PET. That's what the article was about.

I wish I had the powers to take a comment and pin it to the top of a thread. It's a shame yours will get buried by other silliness. 
but life, uh, finds a way.
Plastic-eating microbes can't melt steel beams.
George R.R. Martins Doorways HC  can usually be gotten on ebay for like 5 or six bucks.
Dr Pepper is definitely top tier.
I'll give a reasoning. Pepsi is generally less creamy than coke in my experience. When I drink pop, I generally go for something that cuts and is sharp. Pepsi is the perfect drink for that. Also, whenever I drink coke, it leaves a horrible aftertaste that makes my teeth extremely gritty. I'll settle for a coke if I have to, but Pepsi is my go to. Just my preference, you don't need to take it that seriously.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Jesus, lighten up.

wouldnt now i only stumbled across doorways in the bargin bin.


But he literally said "is Pepsi ok", so that made it relevant
Using your own logic, nobody was talking about opinions before you spoke up, therefore you’re shoving yours down everyone else’s throat.  Have I got that right?

When keeping it real goes wrong.
I'll try to remember to make that distinction when one is pointed at my head.
What does "fell out" mean here? (Sorry, maybe I missed a new slang term?)
What's the difference between a Ferrari and a Kia rio? Nothing right? They're both cars. The difference being this guy has a .22 pistol and the reporter is making it sound like he had a full auto sub machine gun. Is it bad either way? Yes. Is it an incredibly inaccurate description? Yes. It'd be the same as saying I made a 200mph getaway in a red Ferrari when I drove the speed limit in my Kia.
Laughing hysterically 

I don't care about your fucking guns.  Relax.
I'm sure you don't. I'm just pointing out bad reporting. Take it and go.
I agree it's sloppy reporting.  
Then why were you acting like a child? 
This isn't news. This is just viral marketing garbage.
Could you fucking not?
You know this is from a satire site, right? And that this is not real?
Better have van halen for the commercial.

Shame I quit drinking soda, crystal Pepsi was pretty tasty.

I would never buy chobani again if one of these two were involved.
Why? I'm sure you already buy plenty of brands they own and buy plenty of brands owned by other seemingly unlikely owners such as Nestlé. 
Why does the 4MEL levels in New York so much higher? Why isnt someone investigating that oddity?
I was wondering the same thing. Weather? Different factories? Assuming they tested multiple batches so it is not a case of randomness.
I would assume it would be Bottling Companies....they are localized...
Those fuckers better not mess with my Dr. Pepper. 
TIL that Dr Pepper and Snapple are owned by the same company, which is now also Keurig. Weird.
Keurigs are like iPhones batteries in reverse.  My old Keurig can have coffee grounds put into a container and brewed from any coffee I choose.

The new Keurigs though, hey we're not gouging you enough.  No more custom grounds for you!  We're going to remove the ability to add the grounds container for your convenience.

At Keurig, we know how much you hate money, now stop crying and enjoy your way overpriced single serving coffee!
Hot Dr. Pepper whenever I want? I like this deal.
Dr. Pepper flavored coffee... mmmm.
Wow that's really surprising. If anything, I would have expected the opposite...Dr. Pepper/Snapple acquiring Keurig.
I'm looking  forward to a repacking of single serve beverages that drives the cost up 400%.
I don't want to get my Dr Pepper from  kcup. 
[deleted]
Didn't know Keurig was that big.
While the business synergy of this deal is good and sound, it is another example of the growing dominance of multinationals and how they form an oligarchy that control our lives.
In this day and age I sure hope he got consent!
I look forward to hot Dr pepper k-cups
Time to buy some Dr.Pepper pods for my Keurig, instant soda just add water.
Well, at least if they fuck up Snapple, there will still be Arizona Iced Tea...
This is the age of Billion dollar deals.
Mmmm hot dr pepper n snapple
I’m all for it if this means I can finally get some delicious pink lemonade Snapple outside of NYC
I remember reading that they saw their business model wrecking the planet and they cared.

Now they are expanding their reasons to create waste.
This just in Dr. Pepper and Snapple will now only pour into proprietary Keurig cups.  Standard red solo cups can no longer be used.

These cups are only $50 each however they have the same thermal effectiveness of a yetti thermos.
"Made from the least-biodegradable stuff on Earth!"
Keurig machines are wasteful pieces of shit.
all the shitlord pro trump meme makers will have to incorporate the dr pepper logo now you fucktard assmunches. I bet you rural idiots have never been to a 5 guys burger and fries but we lick the dr pepper off the pizzagate victims. sad sad conservitards. so rural and out of touch with the elite.
If he fucks with my Sunkist we are going to have a problem. I need my sunkist. 
>The likelihood that Coke (KO.N) and Pepsi (PEP.O) will get bought has just gone up,” Dibadj said. That would mean a mega-deal, given those soft-drink giants have market values of more than $200 billion and $170 billion respectively. 

No way these ever happen.
Over flavored meets underflavored 
More consolidation and more faux choices. I think they should fold all these companies into something called Hugeconglomco and call it a day.
They also plan to go public under the name Dr. PeppeR-Keurig

I stopped supporting Snapple and their horrid beet root sugared "Dr Pepper" even before they murdered the Dublin Bottling plant. 

Thankfully the bottling plant switched gears and now makes the best cream sodas fucking ever.

Edit:
also, since getting downvotes for what actually happened is a thing.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Dr_Pepper#Lawsuit
Does anyone actually drink that vile-tasting Dr. Pepper?
From the makers of Keurig, Dr. Pepper is now your favorite single serving drink! Just add our patented "k-pop" syrup packet to any Keurig "Sodamaker TM" machine, along with our patented single-use "carbonator" pack for eight ounces of delicious Dr. Pepper.

Just remember our motto "If it isn't literally more expensive by weight than gold, it isn't Keurig"
They also better not mess with my Diet Dr. Pepper. Shit tastes like real soda.
If they did, they would have the wrath of Trey Parker on South Park I think. He drinks Dr Pepper a ton. We have a very powerful ally.
Just what we all wanted, more corporate merger's!
I find it far more likely that we'll get Snapple k cups.
If they do you can protest by smashing your keurig.
They also own Krispy Kream, Peet's Coffee and Einstein Bros Beagles.
I always thought Dr. Pepper was a Coca Cola product.
[deleted]
If you have one of the DRM machines, get a valid (used) k-cup, cut the RFID out of the top and scotch tape it under the lid of the Keurig over the sensor.   You can now use any k-cup you want including ones you fill yourself.   A million dollars of DRM research defeated with $0.001 worth of scotch tape.
They had a brief flirtation with DRM, but I think they changed that stance once the circumvention devices were in every store. The newest machines (at Costco, at least) come with the adapter to use your own grounds.

I think they realized that they could make more money with the value proposition of convenience (the ease of the cups) and the licensing for the cups themselves.
If you were taking the time to fill keurig containers with coffee grounds, why werent you just using a regular coffemaker in the first place?
Presumably a Keurig branding soda stream is coming soon.
Nothing beats the homemade stuff in a glass-glass-glass made of glass.  [Thumbs up for lemon bubble.](https://youtu.be/bIRnM6s4GNo)
Apparently it’s a cold remedy people use.
Could be a thing. There is a coffee shop in my town that serves (iced) a mix of Dr. Pepper, 2 shots of espresso, and they add something else to it (don't remember). Tried it once, it wasn't half bad.
[That's how they used to drink it.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/67488/people-used-heat-their-dr-pepper)
Let me boil up a pot of hot gatorade, is blue ok?
I don't know about that...sounds interesting though. 
Keurig belongs to the [JAB Holding Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAB_Holding_Company), who own quite a few brands. They are rather big.
No one at the company knew of this happening. Fuck you Larry 
Cans.  They're called cans.  If you've been to a vending machine in the past year, they've gone up more than that :P

Actually this is kind of funny. Because Keurig's big appeal to wall street was originally the patented little cup so no one else could sell coffee usable on their machine. They thought they were so clever.

Then another company was able to get a patent for a *biodegradable* version of a cup and fucked Keurig.
It's not. Headline is a little misleading. JAB Holding Corp (who also owns Keurig) is to buy Dr pepper Snapple.

Edit: maybe not... https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180129005537/en/Dr-Pepper-Snapple-Keurig-Green-Mountain-Merge

JAB Holding is still the owners though. 
It puts things in perspective when you realize they make like something like 15¢ on every cup of coffee made with their machines.
You know it was because Dublin violated the agreement in where they were allowed to distribute Dublin DP, right?
Texan here. Yes. 
Oh, is that what we're gonna do today, We're gonna fight?
I like it.
From time to time. That carbonation is intense. 
Cherry Dr. Pepper is like sex except I'm having it.
DPS, now KDP employee here. Yes and now I wonder what this means for my job.
When I drank soda I loved Dr. Pepper(though I loved Mt. Dew more).   If i were to pick up soda again I'd still drink Dr. Pepper.
It's awful as a drink, but is a kick-ass base in BBQ Sauce.
This dystopia must be prevented at all costs. Arm yourself, brothers and sisters! Your beverage needs you!
I'm pretty sure they have this already, Soda Stream.  
Drink a verification can to begin carbonation
For anyone interested in the math, a k-Cup is 9~ grams. Gold is $43.34 per gram currently. That would be $390.06 for 9 grams of gold. 

A k-Cup is between $0.80 and $1.50 for an average of $1.15. This equates to roughly $0.13 per gram of k-Cup coffee. That means that the gold costs about 33,338% more than a k-Cup per gram. 
I'd of rather they sold out to Sodastream than to Keurig. 
I sell a lot of Kuerig stuff. They tried a Kuerig Cold 2 years ago. It failed. I was given a presentation on it, one of the dumber trains of thought I’ve come across. Would you pay $3 for a 10oz glass of non branded soda?

People who actually drink soda won’t and didn’t. 
And the best part is that it only costs $150 for the device and $8 per drink!
Seriously - It's the only "soda" i've found that in it's diet form doesn't have a weird artificial sweetener taste. 

Dr Pepper+bourbon+bitters+cherry grenadine makes a damn fine after work relaxer.

Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper was the bomb, but not usually available in stores these days. Actually, I think those are done.
Dude has [standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxDvjWTCmIY).
Seth MacFarlane gonna have beef with him again, he's [Team Mr Pibb](https://youtu.be/8Db_l1uylHo).
I had long forgotten that there was even a coffeemachine manufacturer named Keurig until people in this topic started referring to those. Most people just have those terrible Senseo things (that is, coffee is always terrible, but Senseo is even more terrible). Everyone seems to hate them, and yet you keep coming across them.

I have to say, though. Keurig is a pretty good brandname. You'd expect everything they make to be, well, neat. It's literally in their name.
Mmmm....beagles.
Those are owned by Kuerig's parent, JAB Holding Company.
Stumptown as well
Fuckin Einsteins man. I worked at like 3 of thems in Phoenix when i was younger.
It's definitely a common misconception. There aren't all that many non-Coke/non-Pepsi products that you see at the soda fountains so it's a reasonable assumption.
Dr. Pepper used to license out to both coke and Pepsi bottlers & distributors.  
Coca Cola has Mr. Pibb, the Dr. Pepper knock-off
Depending on the region they, Dr. Pepper, can get licensed to either Coca Cola or Pepsi bottlers.  Where I live, Pepsi is in charge of distributing it.  So it can be hard to find at Coke only establishments.

An interesting quirk of this is that my local convienance store is large enough that they are spread out over several regions.  So they have Dr. Pepper coded to applicable to both Coke and Pepsi sales.  Only one or the other, though.
Mr. Pibb is Coca-Cola. 
Oh, hell no. Mr. Pibb is a Coca-Cola product, and it was introduced to compete with Dr. Pepper.

This is just... blasphemy.
It's not. Dr Pepper is often distributed by PepsiCo but is its own organization. They just tie into Pepsi's vast distribution network rather than set up their own, but Dr Pepper isn't owned in part or whole by PepsiCo, as I understand it. 
Nope. They are their own company with 7 -UP. However they have used Pepsi for their bottling and canning in the past. According to the can in front of me, now it is done by an affiliate of the American Bottling Company.
Why are all you people refilling k-cups and putting tape over sensors when you can just make coffee in a regular goddamn coffeemaker 
Or. Or. You can just buy a Cuisineart or Proctor Silex for half the price AND they have attachments for ground brewing.

I am not certain why people are going through this instead of getting a cheaper (and usually more reliable) option?
Some people only want a cup at a time. It just seems like a hassle to make a small pot of coffee if you're the only drinking it and you're only going to have one cup :)
Plus no coffee pot to clean out! 

Sometimes tho I agree, it's just simpler to use a coffee pot 
They tried something similar and it BOMBED.

https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-119011-Drinkmaker-White-Discontinued/dp/B0163HQRTQ
People used to drink warm/ hot Dr pepper a lot. Apparently, I'm not that old. Adam's mom can be seen heating some up in the Brendan Fraser hit Blast from the Past.
Sounds interesting, but it wouldn't taste good. Spiced coffee like that rarely comes through when it becomes actual coffee. Then you'd have to get a good brand, because in my experience the 'OMGSOPREMIUMBRAND' is complete garbage (Starbucks ground coffee is disgusting trash). Coffee drinks are usually made by making good coffee and then mixing things into it in a certain way. Having it all made together is a recipe for trash.
Legally no one could know. Isn't that grounds for insider trading if someone had bought / sold stocks?
Most vending machines don't even dispense cans anymore, but annoyingly large plastic bottles where it seems like people only drink 1/2 the bottle and throw the rest away.
Sales have fallen considerably. That's why they're branching out. Two biggest culprits being their 2.0 fiasco and the now growing economy where consumers are increasingly going back to buying more expensive prepared coffee from restaurants/coffee shops.
Keurig is not doing well at all. JAB is fine. 

Source: I sell green coffee to Keurig roasters
They had a knock off that was Dublin Dr Pepper in all but name and they were told to knock it off too. Very sad, but their other sodas are really good anyway. Definitely worth a visit if you live within an hour or two! 
actually, it was people who bought the product and resold it outside the arbitrary border, not the plant itself.

Snapple had gotten jealous because its beet sugar "real sugar" version was doing horrible. So they attacked the competition for the bottom line. Capitalism 
Another Texan here. Also yes.
Why don't you have a nice hot cup of Dr. Pepper and calm down.
Well, shit - at least Pibb isn't that bad.
Soda Stream will do for soda what 3D printing did for assault rifles.
I thought so and started writing that but SodaStream is *Dr. Pete*...shares in SodaStream also fell post this announcement apparently
I mean Keurig makes their own soda k-cups

Which, according to a comment further down, unsurprisingly failed
O dam I've never even thought of that combination but I already know how I'm spending my Friday night. 
Oh man, wait until you try Dr Pepper 10, it tastes SUPER close to regular and is only 10 cals a can.
Personally whenever I hear keurig i think of the south park episode where they use 'courics' as the unit of measurement for enormous craps.
Would you like your beagles toasted sir?
They still do in a lot of places. You'll find some areas where it's distributed by Coke, others by Pepsi, and some more by Dr Pepper/Snapple.
Yep. It's in some Coca Cola Freestyle machines, even. I can easily see why someone would assume Coca Cola owns it. 
Just because Mr Pibb didn't have a chance to get some fancy doctorate, doesn't mean he's a knock off.

He's a hard working family man, with a wife and kids to take care of.
"Mr. Pibb is a replica of Dr Pepper, but it's the bullshit replica, cause dude didn't even get his degree! Why'd you have to drop out and start making pop so soon?"
Interestingly, the introduction of Mr. Pibb is why Coca-Cola was not permitted to purchase Dr. Pepper in the United States.
They are distributed by both Pepsi and coke in the US.
Depends on where you are in the US. 
The earth ain't gonna pollute itself.
Personally I like different flavor coffees so making 1 cup at a time allows to change flavors, plus it is always fresh.  I guess I could get a normal miniature coffee make but that takes more time.   
Its like $400 that's why. People who drink soda can't afford that.
Because they didn’t have any real soda brands. 
Another poster prompted me to google it, [and yep, it's real](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/soda-hot-dr-pepper-warm-soda-tradition-southern-drinks.html).  TIL
There is Coca-cola coffee, in Japan at least, and its enjoyable.  A little bit pricy for the amount you get, but I really like it.
True but still. Fuck my job uncertainty. 
I swear to god that bottles from vending machines are not as cold as a can. I know it is probably a placebo of it feeling colder in my hand but I cannot finish a 16oz bottle without it feeling to warm halfway through.
I went in reverse. Giant bag of Kirkland coffee = $12 for coffee at home for 2 months.
Texan right here. I love the Dublin plant. Almost everything they make is great.
> actually, it was people who bought the product and resold it outside the arbitrary border, not the plant itself.

Resale wasn't a breach of the agreement, selling it directly was.
Another Texan, and fuck yeah.

Best damn soda there is.
Oh, gods, it's [real](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/soda-hot-dr-pepper-warm-soda-tradition-southern-drinks.html)
Walking through Walmart, Eyeing Dr. Thunder.....
You shut your lying mouth.
Nothing of practical importance?
Where I live, they only sell normal Dr. Pepper. Well, that and Dr. Pepper Cherry. But no Diet Dr. Pepper, let along Dr. Pepper 10. 

Not sure what the point of a "Dr. Pepper Cherry" is, considering normal Dr. Pepper already tastes like cherry.
10 just tastes like watered down Dr pepper to me. 
But that weird residue, especially when you drink it from a glass?
No thank you, I like mine fresh, just slice it an half please.
What types of schmear do you have for your beagles? 
wow you’re right! i got dr pepper at the movie theater last night from one of those machines and didn’t even think twice about it. 
That's all well and good but impersonating a doctor is a serious offense.  
He's not all snobby like one of those Dr. sodas. He's the kind soda you could grab a beer with.

No, Mr. Pibb earns his paycheck.
True! It depends on who has the better distribution offer per region. I should have said so. 
At one soda per day, for 365 days bought from a convenience store, you'd easily pay more this year for soda than the machine cost. Assuming you can get value out of it, it could sell (even if that had to be at tax time.) 
They released coffee coca cola in Australia about 4 months ago. I tried it the other day on clearance. It was truly vile.
Definitely! The vending machines on my campus only sold bottle size, which I would always end up taking home to put in my fridge because they were room temp half way through! I always just thought I was drinking too slowly. 
20oz bottle has a lot more surface area than a 16oz can
Yes, they directly sold the product to distributors who then sold it outside of the boundaries. 

But it was Snapple being greedy as fuck.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Dr_Pepper#Lawsuit
Hot Dr. Pepper and lemon is so good. No joke.
https://youtu.be/KTJn_DBTnrY
It's sweeter and lighter with a stronger emphasis on the cherry flavor and an almost non-existent cola flavor. It's also a little fizzier. It's like drinking a Cherokee Red or a Cheerwine but with a little more body than a pure cherry soda like that.
Coming right up sir! Would you like some butter on your beagle?
Coca Cola tried to market as Dr. Pibb but that was shot down as violating trademark.
Don't think you're considering the cost of the syrup or CO2 tanks in this. 
Where can I buy 16oz cans?

I only have 12oz cans here.
I get what you're saying but also metal is a better conductor which may balance that. Maybe this could be a good askscience question. I also know from a previous askscience thread that carbonation leaks from PET bottles and not cans so maybe that is also a factor in the mouth feel from the bottle halfway through where it gets slightly warm. It may be the equivalent temperature of the  can but the carbonation amount makes it taste different. There are likely a lot of factors here...
    
**Edit** Also on a semi related note, the temperature is a huge factor in carbonation amount more so than the plastic, if you get a 2 liter and plan on drinking it over multiple days you should not open it at room temperature. A lot more of the CO2 will get released upon opening resulting in flatter soda the next day.

> they directly sold the product to distributors who then sold it outside of the boundaries. 

Yep, and distribution was in breach of the contract. Resale !=distribution.

It wasn't Dr Pepper Snapple being greedy as much as it was Dublin was in breach of a contract.
Yes please, the butter really helps smooth out the dog hair so its easier to swallow.
So he tried to forge a medical degree on top of it?   
According to some website:  "between $3.99 and $4.99 for a pack of four. Each pod produced an 8 ounce glass of soda — less than a standard can."  

Meanwhile I can get a 12pack of 12oz cans for $5.  Did someone not run the numbers for this stupid business proposal?  I don't think people mind paying a premium for fresh tasting coffee but soda can sit in a can for a long time before it makes a bit of a difference. 



You can buy the refill tanks at retail, assuming distribution is good. If they make a deal with a major retail group, it could work. 
meant 12oz :\
I think youre on to something about CO2. A can is not resealable, so it is consumed quicker. A bottle with a cap gets transported, and every time you remove the cap for a sip, you let out some more CO2. Metal can and more CO2 probably affect perceived coldness a lot.
Mother in law would insist on having the damn soda bottle at room temp. The thing would go flat before it got finished and I would poor it down the sink muttering about how she saved SOOOO much money by not putting it in the fridge and wasting electricity. Her daughters are the same way, thrifty in an assholish sort of way.
I dunno why you're so viciously defending Snapple, But to be honest the scale of the plant was minuscule compared to the corporate juggernaut.

Snapple failed to compete with the quality and popularity of the Dublin brand, so they bullied the competition away. Plain as that.
Oh excellent. We'll have Ron here bring you the beagles in a couple minutes. 
Not only that, but often pop is on sale for 3/10 or cheaper
I'm not defending them.

They fucked up.
Can I get a baker's dozen of those beagles? The whole litter please.  
Man you're real hungry for our beagles
> "The Food and Drug Administration has also said that a consumer would have to drink more than 1,000 cans of soda a day to reach the doses administered that have shown links to cancer in rodents."

Obviously I would boil my 12,000 ounces of soda into a manageable gallon of delectably sweet cancer causing concentrate. Geez who has time for 1000 cans of soda.
It would come out to 93.75 gallons, I'm not a doctor but in pretty sure that you stomach can't even hold that much, I really don't think it's possible to drink that much without throwing it back up.
I thought it said moose carcasses. Now I feel vaguely disappointed it didn't.
finally, a reason to purchase Mountain Dew!
And we've got pictures to prove it!
New Mountain Dew EXTREME-now with 50% more mouse dissolving ability and the refreshing taste of wild cherry!
I was under the impression coke can dissolve a metal nail, if you give it enough time . What I want to know is how the fact that the can or bottle was pressurized with a mouse inside how that would effect the rate that the mouse dissolves
Mountain Dew or Crab Juice? 
Blecch! Ew! Sheesh! I'll take a crab juice. 
As opposed to a non-cancer causing carcinogen?
meh.. everything causes cancer.

Has anyone heard of savesurge.org? This site has literally been up for over 10 years. http://www.savesurge.org/  Today is a day to remember, never give up on your dreams. 
Back in the late 90s, when I was a socially-inept teen, a few of my other socially-inept teen friends would have Axis and Allies weekends, which included a very regimented tradition of cold stale pizza and warm flat Surge.  It's been 14 years since I had one of those weekends.

Maybe it's time for the Axis to be beaten back again.
This is something literally every marketing company can rave over.

Brand loyalty and massive marketing developed during the decade spanning the late 80s to 90s created a generation of children so interwoven into the fabric of American consumption that they, nearly two decades later, pine for a soda only slightly dissimilar to what's already on market. 

It would be astonishing that a movement of such magnitude could be developed around a soda, but in perspective it's exactly what we can expect from a final generation of mall shoppers crowing to relive their glory days drinking Surge and listening to Filter/ Orgy/ Limp Biskit. 

The driving force behind the call for Surge is a tribute to its marketing and the nostalgia it generates to a whole market of former adolescents driven to the beat of brand marketing like Pavlovian bells. 

And like I was trained for the first formative 20 years of my life, I too, desperately want a six pack of surge, an unopened box of MTG:Tempest and Life is Peachy playing on a CD player in another room.


This is great right next to the article link about 50% of US adults being pre-diabetic or diabetic.

Woohoo! Slurm is back! *It's highly addictive!*
Apparently Norway was the only country still selling (s)Urge prior to this. Mind blown.
I need that green, that hocus pocus focus juice, don't need a fo or a deuce, just need that surge to help me get through.
now if we can just get *OK Soda* too.
Can confirm, I work at Amazon and saw a pallet full of them last night.
The 14 year old inside me just had an orgasm.

Why not Josta?

Surge would go amazingly well with some Doritos 3D.
I want Pepsi crystal to make a comeback 
Bring back Clearly Canadian! 
I can't be the only one that misses Sprite remix
Mannn now if they'd just bring back 3D Doritos. I miss them so much.
Now we need to bring back the original Jolt from the late 80s. All the sugar and twice the caffeine! 
One step closer to Brawno! It got electrolytes!
"You are signed up to receive an email when this item is available. "
I used to work for a bottler that made Surge... it was the worst product to make.

All of Coca Cola's products are unitized so you know how much of each ingredient to add to your batch tank in order to make it properly. 10 units of surge called for some liquid concentrate, citric acid, potassium citrate, sodium benzoate, and a literal ton of maltodextrin. Yes, 2000 pounds of malto, packed in 50 lb bags that required cutting open and dumping manually into a batch hopper.

The hopper worked by the venturi effect, sucking powder into the water stream as the tank filled. You only had a finite amount of water to use to get all 2000 pounds into the tank, and that shit was sticky and would gum up the works if you poured too fast.

The worst part of all this was our filling lines could run 15-20 units an hour, but we only had two tanks and could only batch it up 10 units at a time. So on a long production run, you would find yourself slinging 3 or 4 tons of maltodextrin over the course of half a shift just to keep up with production.

tl/dr: I worked for a bottler that made Surge in the 1990s. Fuck Surge.
As a teen back in the '90s, my friends and I would frequently feed our rushes by drinking this fully-loaded citrus soda while feasting on the finest Bigfoot pizzas Pizza Hut had to offer.

This would fuel our late night SNES sessions, DOS games, and accompany the latest VHS rental from the local video store. That was the shiznit... Well, my home skillets, gotta bounce!
I want sprite remix



ARUBA HAM!
I'm looking at you Pepsi (Crystal Clear Pepsi)!
Now to bring back French Toast Crunch!
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00M2OGS08?vs=1 

Amazon page for Surge. In case anyone's feels nostalgic for the 90's
Now can we PLEASE work on getting back Snapple Rain??!

edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! I didnt realize there were other people who loved that cactus juice as much as I did!
I remember, vividly, Surge coming to my High School as part of its marketing launch.  The gave us free Surge, coupons for free Surge, and coupons for buy one get one free Surge (when the other coupons ran out).  Those of us on the Coke mailing list (which included me as one of my high school hobbies had been to call up 800 numbers for national corporations and ask them obnoxious questions or leave odd feedback) also got 2 free Surge CDs.  One for us and one to give a friend.  The songs were like Surge itself, bad at first, and then good, and then stuck with you forever.

It was a brilliant campaign, because by the time we were done with our free Surge, my friends and I were converts.  No more Mountain Dew to fuel out all night World of Darkness campaigns, no sir, we were Surge men now!
My friends and I used to set a can of Surge on one end of a friend's basement and scatter obstacles (tables, couches, what have you) in the path to it. Then we'd line up at the opposite end, one of us would yell SUUUURGGGE, and we'd all fight each other and the obstacles to be the one to get to it. Ahh, memories. 
So this is a shot in the dark but since there are a lot of 90's era folks in the thread, here goes:

There used to be a pizza shop near me in the mid-90s that had a non-carbonated cherry flavored fountain drink. It was amazing. They stopped carrying it because people would order it thinking it was soda and then return or have them dump it when they found it wasn't carbonated. No other cherry drink comes close to that stuff and I spoke with the owner and all he could tell me was that it was a Pepsi product. I've never found out what it was still to this day, and constantly search. Reddit, help me!
I don't know how it came about, but there was a rumor while in middle school, shortly after the release of Surge... the rumor was it would shrink your balls.  Months later it was not included in any of the vending machines. 
Surge. Good god. Won my first gameboy from one
I won a surge alarm clock when I was a kid. it would just keep screaming "SURGE!" really loud until you turned it off. it was the scariest/most efficient alarm I had as a kid.
Now all we need is for Hi-C to bring back Ecto Cooler and we'll be in business.
Bring back Josta, then we can talk.
We already have it in Norway, its called "Urge", excactly the same from Coca-Cola
I be the people at /r/HailCorporate are going fucking nuts over this whole thing.
I'm slightly amused to see this link sharing the front page of r/news with this one:  "50% of US Adults have either pre-diabetes or diabetes."
The reviews are great!

So relevant! Song about Surge
http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2ghdu2/op_delivers_on_surge_release_q3q4_2014/

An alleged Coca Cola employee stated that Surge would be back a few months ago.

He....he actually delivered...
I'm happy that Surge is back, even though I was never a fan.

But Where is ‪#‎CRYSTALPEPSI‬?????????

The social media demand for that is 6 years old now, I didn't know Pepsi hated money, why does pepsi hate money? Stop hating money pepsi, bring back crystal pepsi so you can have our money. if you hate money that much, you should still release crystal pepsi, then take our money, but before it can bother you give our money to charity, or kittens. I don't care what you do with the money just give us crystal pepsi.
This just goes to show that Crystal Pepsi has a chance to make a comeback

Can we just bring back the 90's in general?
Anyone else remember those Surge commercials that had people flippin' out and screaming "SUUURGE!". That made me want to break shit as a kid. 
[deleted]
I just want Vanilla coke back. It's impossible to find in my area.
In the Beginning, the Coke said,
"Let there be Surge."
And there was Surge. And it was good.

And then A Great Darkness spread o'er the land.
And the Light of Surge was snuffed out.
Like a fart in the wind.

And Lo, the nights were long.
And lonely.
And lacking in Surge.

And in these desperate years,
We Lay with Red Bull.
And with Vault.

And yet as we looked upon ourselves in the mirror,
We felt only emptiness in our hearts.
For our love was true, and belonged only to Surge.

But Hark! The voice of the people rang out in the night.
And we would not be silenced.
And we would not be ignored.

And then from the darkness,
When all hope seemed lost,
Surge rose from the ashes like a Glorious Phoenix.

And the people rejoiced.
For they never gave up, and never surrendered hope,
That we might one day again take pure joy into our mouth holes.

That Day has Arrived.
Hope has Become Reality.
The Light of Surge shines brightly once more.

Drink up Brothers,
Drink up Sisters.
Your Prayers have been Answered.
What if after all this campaigning, the Surge Movement founders tasted the soda and found that they actually hated it now? 
Meh.  Jolt cola or it doesn't matter. 
it's back in stock on amazon. gogogogogogo
Today Surge, tomorrow Fruitopia. 
If Snapple would bring back Snapple Elements, I would be soooo happy...
If only Pepsi blue would come back.....
Reminds me of [Jooky Soda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGRNHiMN9ZI).
Diablo and Surge.  So much nostalgia.
Now, to get back Josta and OK Soda.
We can agree this is because of YTCracker, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpiQiySOHE
i don't mean to toot my own horn here.. but i totally liked the surge movement facebook page like 6 months ago.. that means i'm cool right?
Hot damn!!!!!  Now I can make my favorite mixed drink of all time again.   I call it 'scurge'.  It consists of Surge and whatever type of booze you have handy. 
[Yes! Now I can redeem my Surge points and own Jenna Maroney!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_43x-BmHEk)
should have brought back Citra instead.
In this era of literally hundreds or thousands of different types of craft beer from the US alone, this raises the question: "Why not just bring back all forgotten sodas?" Clearly there's a market for all of them. 
We actually have this soda in Norway. Its really popular and every shop sells it.

Forget surge bring back ecto cooler they own that too :(
Bring back Jolt, then we'll talk. 
Give me Sprite Remix back or give me nothing
Can coca-cola bring back French toast crunch?
Now if we can just get Doritos to bring back 3d Doritos.
And it's already sold out, damn!
Now bring back wonder balls!
The [reviews](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/cr/B00M2OGS08/ref=mw_dp_cr) are absolute gold.
diabeetus at an all time high this time next year!
Sometime after Surge came out my 1980 Ford Fairmont was rear-ended. Passersby and firefighters ushered me and everyone else away from my car as liquid was pouring out of the back of my car. Later when I went to the lot to collect my belongings from the totaled vehicles I opened the trunk and witnessed the shrapnel of 100+ exploded cans of Surge that I had bought at a ridiculous discount due to promo coupons. It was Surge, not gasoline that poured all over the highway that fateful day.
Anyone else get the surge promo cd with third eye blind , sugar ray and done other random 90's bands?
Bring back Vault, you cowards!
OH MY GOODNESS. This is amazing. I drank so much of that as a kid, surge with Baja picante Doritos. 
No freaking way! Surge!
Reading this hurts my teeth
I want P.B. Crisps back!! They were so incredible
God damnit can we get them to bring back Crystal Pepsi also?
Prices on ebay are going nuts, bids over $100 for a 12 pack right now
Can we open Vault next?
Now all they need to do is bring back those 3D Doritos. Especially the jalepeno flavor.
It's all just sugar and carbonation, both of which fuck my stomach up, HAIL COCA-COLA!
Bring Brawndo and water your farms.
Now bring "Doritos 3D" back

Finally I can justify Amazon Prime. 
This link was right under the 50% of US is diabetic or pre-diabetic on the front page for me
What they *should* do is bring Vanilla Coke back to Canada!
They're only about 9 years late. The energy drink market is starting to go flat. 


I'm still buying a case. 
Fuck Surge. I will personally invest $1000 to a kickstarter that makes authentic OK Soda. Ahhh... Canned Suicide.

^^^^1-800-IFEELOK
Not many excited people here, but I am VERY excited about this. I remember drinking this all the time in school. Glad to see Coke trying to bring it back for the fan base from all those years ago. 
I'm just waiting on them to bring back Zima now
If only someone would bring back Pepsi Blue. I loved that stuff!
Now if only this could happen to SoBe's Mr. Green. Loved that stuff!
End of the season youth soccer parties just got turned back up to 11.
Wasn't surge just coke's shitty response to mtn dew? Eww. No.
Everyone, lets start a petition to Planters to bring back PB Crisps!
"Surge is my favorite soda!" said no one ever.
[deleted]
For a moment I read "Surge" as "Slurm".

Not sure whether to thank dyslexia, Futurama, or the crack in my phone screen.
I visited the 'World of Coca-Cola' in Atlanta.  At the end of their tour, there's a huge room with "every flavor" of soda that Coke produces around the world... but no Ecto-cooler.

So I asked one of the employees about Ecto-cooler, and she looked at me and said "*what's that?"*.  It was a sad day.
And Creepy Crawlers.
Yes! Yes! Y.E.S. Yes!   
  
there's a couple recipes online for DIY ecto-cooler, but honestly part of the magic is that it comes from those tiny little juice boxes.
And green ninja turtles vanilla pies!
I drank so much ecto-cooler in grade school.

When I opened my lunchbox and slimer was there, it was like "awww yiss!"
Am I the only person on earth that realizes Ecto-cooler was just tangerine flavored Hi-C, which YOU CAN STILL BUY? I see it on lists of things people wish still existed, and not once has anyone mentioned the fact that it still exists under a different name.
When I was stationed on Okinawa one of the craziest things to see was that Ecto-cooler never stopped being available over there. Still had Slimer on the little boxes too. It was also reasonably common at some of the fast-food places there. 

And yeah I bought a shitload of it. 
Well, if you smoke, [there's this](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ecto-cooler-e-juice-baker-vapor/) to help you quit.
I'm more hoping for Mr. Pibb.  Dr. Pepper is nice, Pibb Xtra is horrible, but if they brought back the original Mr. Pibb, wow... I'd be so happy.
Yes! ah the memories of opening up my lunch box and sucking down an Ecto cooler
Acoording to this source: http://www.foodiggity.com/a-dose-of-ephemera-ecto-cooler/ they have the same drink just re-renamed as 'Crazy Citrus Cooler,' but I don't know if it's green; I don't Hi-C anymore, but I'd figure it's probably the same orange it was originally before they did thought to do a BG tie-in.
Kind of random, but thanks for this. I used to drink (and love) Cactus Cooler and forgot the name (kind of a regional drink - I moved). You gave me the memory spark and I will find it again.
Maybe they are waiting for the next ghostbusters movie to be made
Oh I miss that awesome green liquid!
http://www.ghostbusterschicago.com/content/ecto-cooler-recipe
I'd murder a bus full of orphaned nuns to get Ecto-Cooler back.
I'd like a can of Storm.
[I started a petition!](http://www.change.org/p/minute-maid-division-of-the-coca-cola-company-bring-back-ecto-cooler)
[Ecto Cooler never left my friend](http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/2011/09/yes-you-can-finally-make-your-own-ecto-cooler/)
I read that as ecto-cooter and immediately went to google..all i got was a bunch of ghost busters pictures....disappointed.
I think everyone visiting it crashed the 90's server.
I love old sites like these. Reminds of the angelfire/geocities days.
Yes, especially when your dreams involve excessive amounts of sugar and morbid obesity...
okay I was born in 92, drank a fuck ton of soda in my childhood, but never remember drinking or even seeing Surge soda. I live on the East Coast of the USA, was Surge a nationwide thing? This soda came out in 97 and laste until 2003 apparently? I remember pepsi blue, and a lot of other weird shit but not Surge
Whoa whoa whoa.

Did you and your friends also buy the 25 cent Doritos sandwich crackers and little debbie snacks?

Did you also have those giant refillable soda mugs from the gas station?

Were you one of my friends?
By "be beaten back" you mean "crush Russia from both sides before the U.S. or Britain can respond", right?

...I wonder if the PC version still works.
I'm in college and used to play Axis and Allies a ton in high school. My old econ teacher even played with one of our science teachers on their off periods. Quality game!

EDIT: I should probably also add that the first time I played (UK), my friend playing Russia lost Moscow on the first turn :(
ADIDAS (All day I dream about Surge) 
I am a product of my environment.
It's Coca-Cola.  Nobody does branding like them.  Hell, they invented *Santa Claus* as we know him to day.  Nostalgia for a soft drink from childhood is nothing by their standards.  
But Filter and Orgy were pretty good...Limp Bizkit, not so much.
First, your timeline is *way* off.  Surge was released in the early mid-90's, but wasn't "big" until a few years later, before Limp Bizkit rose to fame.  

Second,  I seem to recall the shit storm raised over Coke changing recipes.  While these "kids" are excited to relive a moment from childhood, the "new Coke kids" were almost riotous.  

I am not immune to marketing, but I'm not pining for my "glory days" either.  If I see Surge at the store, of course I'll pick up a bottle/can to see if my memories match the drink or if my nostalgia shaped the taste.  I will agree that they had amazing marketing for those times.  "Extreme" was in, and Surge was way "extremer" than MD.
I just want the soda, but to each their own
True story. http://zombiefightsshark.com/2014/09/15/the-return-of-the-surge/
You hit the nail on the head. The nostalgia market right now is at it's peak and it really surprises me why more companies aren't taking advantage of that. Hopefully companies will see that with Surge selling out in a matter of hours that "there's gold in them thar hills" and we'll see a limited release of other past items. Also, your last paragraph really got the nostalgia-coaster rolling for me. I wasn't paying M:tG at the time, so I had to Google when Tempest was released and found this: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/expert/Tempest/Tempest.asp  It appears to be a forgotten page on the official WotC site from when that expansion was released. 
I have been humming My Generation all day. Well said sir!
It's Limp Bizkit!

You've been outed as not one of us!
It's not Surge's fault. It's been discontinued for like 20 years. What was the diabetic rate like 20 years ago? Maybe this will bring back those levels?  Haha
[deleted]
of course.  it's all up on ebay for double the price already.
Dude. The headline had me literally screaming "Yes!" Only to be immediately deflated once I checked. 
Not currently sold out, as of 7:06pm EDT

http://i.imgur.com/BC2wdMh.png

Apparently it gets sold out and restocked. Probably why it is listing an extra 1-2 day processing now.
Serious question - why so much nostalgia for Surge?  Wasn't it a Mountain Dew clone?  Or was it better?
Back up now. I just ordered a pack. Says they'll ship out on the 19th. Although when I added to my cart and completed the order, it said 20th. 

edit: Nvm. Sold out. Wow, I guess I was lucky.
That's okay. The better it does, the more likely they'll be to bring it back for real in brick and mortar stores.
Top 10 reasons why Surge rocks!

1. It brings back the dead
This is 100% legit for sure
/r/nosleep
No way he's sleeping through this!
I'm scared
"wimmy wam wam wozzle" 
This should be higher 
The main reason we're on top of the Human Development Index. Damn that shit tastes good
Yeah, we even got a [energy drink](http://www.brandlab.no/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Urge_case_01_lowres.jpg) that taste like heaven.
   
Am from norway and can confirm. Only difference is that its called Urge in Norway. Came back to the market a couple of years ago.
drinks these days don't have that punch, now i gotta drink 7 up for lunch. 
> I need that green, that hocus pocus focus juice, don't need a fo or a deuce, just need that surge to help me get ~~through~~ loose.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpiQiySOHE
This is the first thing I thought too
And a Bigfoot pizza?
Only if they also bring back 1-800-I-FEEL-OK.
I lived on that stuff in Jr. College.  Grilled cheese and an OK Soda at the CCC Cafeteria.  One day I remember reading the OK Soda ingredients.  I recall one stood out.  Ester of wood rosin.  "There's tree sap in my soda" I recall thinking, as I finished the can.  Don't care, loved that stuff.
Well, they are sold out now, and most of us weren't able to get any. :(
Question:Amazon is one super large mystery to me. I LOVE them but they seem to operate on fairy magic. How does one work at Amazon, do they have warehouses, and how is it that they sell EVERYTHING?
Strike that, reverse it?
I'm holding out for OK Soda.  That shit was good.
YES! Pepsi needs to bring Josta back. I loved that stuff!
This. Surge is pretty much mountain dew.  Josta was unique in it's flavor.  And as an energy drink, it tasted way better than Monster or Red Bull does now.  
Fuck off. -surge. 
I come from a somewhat taller than average family, and I'm pretty sure Josta is the reason my height never quite reached 6ft 
"It's a fully loaded citrus soda with carbos!"

Damn, there's a marketing tagline I haven't heard since middle school. Suddenly brought back a flood of memories!
Crystal Pepsi...I'd be ok with that. As long as they still use the Van Halen song as the theme song
You know, if they had made a Breaking Bad cross promo, they might have sold a lot.
Pepsi Blue, you heathen.
Damn right dude. Crystal Pepsi was awesome.
Try Not See Cola. It's basically the same formula as Crystal Pepsi, and is said to taste identical.

[You went back to September 10, 2001, and all you thought to do was bring back some Crystal Pepsi?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa53YQtdBm0)



edit: original version is something like like "Did you get to say goodbye to your dad?" but i cant find it.
But it tasted like crap. Red bull cola needs to return!

http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001IW05IQ?pc_redir=1410745809&robot_redir=1
Isn't that what plants crave?
Sorry you had to do your job.
Here here! I've been pestering Pepsi to bring back Crystal Clear Pepsi since I first got internet. I hope one day to have it again. 
I'm not sure if 90s internet was so blah, or my computer took a shit in that link.

Although I do remember waiting 30 minutes for a web page to load back in the AOL days.
Man someone gilded your for this, they must really love that shit.
Fuck yeah! 
Me, too!  Baton Rouge High School.  You?
*FREE* coupons for *FREE* Surge?!
That was the whole "Yellow no. 5 will diminish your man-berries" rumor. It was said about several sodas, but Surge was the one that caught it the worst as I recall. 
I got a Surge bucket hat, probably from the same promotion. Wore it everywhere for years. Hopefully I still have it around here somewhere.
I won the Surge walkie talkies! Still have them!
I never tried Josta, don't even remember it being around at the time, but a friend of mine raves about it. What did it taste like?
Can confirm.

http://imgur.com/OHUo0pa
http://www.savesurge.org/phoenix4.jpg this was posted in a different thread, but from that I wouldn't say exactly the same, but it's plausible the only difference is color.
Yet another reason why I wanna move to Norway.

With the help of Surge we'll get those pre-diabetes numbers down quite a bit!
I think my favorite would have to be:  
  
  
"Surge is everything about my childhood that was great. If i bowled a 100 or more with out bumpers my dad would treat me by buying me a 12 pack for the week. After Surge was discontinued he left me mom for a whore but now that its back Im going to bring him a surge and he'll love me again right? SURGE IS LOVE, SURGE IS LIFE!"
these reviews....love them. Especially the:

"My brother has been in a coma for 12 years. I whispered into his ear that they were bringing Surge back and he shot straight up, did a backflip out of bed and roundhouse kicked a nurse. 
  
The miracle is real. SUUUUUUURRRRRGGGGGEEEEE!"
"I am converting my 401k into Surge..."

hey, you whore. that's your comment.
Pepsi blue. 
The dream of the 90's is alive..
..*sips vanilla coke*
There are these new pop dispenser/vending machines at fast food places now that let you pick between a bunch and you can modify the drinks for more unpopular ones, vanilla Dr. Pepper, cherry Dr. Pepper etc. Well they have a vanilla coke one, boy was I excited. Tasted like pepsi with vanilla. Rarely have I been that disappointed. 

TLDR: On those custom machines go 2parts reg coke to 1part vanilla coke.
I didn't know it wasn't available everywhere.  My husband gets one every time he goes to CVS...
No no..vanilla *cherry* Coke.
Its got electrolytes, its what plants crave
YES. Dear god yes!!! Best thing I've ever had. I'm amazed at the amount of people who never had them!
Oh man I loved those so much. It was like a Dorito had a baby with a cheese puff and said offspring was more powerful than you could ever imagine...

I kinda just want the world to pretend it's the 90s/00s again. Minus the wars and Bush Jr
They're here in Thailand! 
[deleted]
They're not selling energy drinks... they're selling dreams...
heh. flat.
Zima's pretty damn refreshing, I brought as much as I could when I last went to Japan and have been saving them for special occasions.

Way better than the sticky overly sugary Smirnoff stuff.

There's one out there already! Stumbled across it online and signed it a few months ago. 
"Party on contest winners, party on" 
Well, it isn't soda, it was a Hi-C flavor. But Hi-C is owned by Coca-Cola, so.... yeah.

That Italian drink though... I will never forget it. 
They got some NASTY shit coming out of some of those fountain rotundas.
Did it have Vault or Vault Zero?  I miss the hell out of Vault Zero.  Better than Diet Mountain Dew anyday.
Ecto-Cooler wasn't a soda.
Did they have Mr. Pibb?  Not the horrible Pibb Xtra, but the honest-to-goodness-better-than-Dr.-Pepper Mr. Pibb?  If so, I might have to make a trip down to Atlanta.
I'm pretty sure we have had this available in Norway for years....only it's called [URGE...](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKuZ4xQS3wmqVvsZTJCceJXqPqEnjYRLlN1cTv4BtW2GUyYcLU) 
I would love to see a picture of that or a listing of them. I can't seem to find them.
Judging by this comment I don't believe you know the deliciousness of ecto-cooler. 
maybe try asking bill murray
I would die for some Ecto-Cooler Hi-C and some Squirt Citrus Power.
Did you try the Beverly? Oh god... the beverly.
Is that like a clown not knowing who Bozo is?

"You're hung up on some drink from the 80s man!!"
AND it has to have Slimer on it!
I don't know, my ecto cooler came in the tin cans you needed a church key for and it was still delicious.
http://www.nerdist.com/2011/09/relive-the-80s-by-making-your-own-ecto-cooler/
Your head is in the right place, sir. No lie, I have recipes for both ecto cooler and those pies in my Pocket account.
Never had one, but I will never forget begging my mom to get me one. It is truly my greatest food disappointment. 
I would pay so much money for those right now.  
Holy shit! I just started vaping a little over a month ago! I'm gonna nab some of that up right quick! Thank you so much! 
We have normal Mr. Pibb at some places here in PA (competes with Dr. Pepper) but it's pretty prevalent in VA
That's funny because they are the exact same soda.  Incredible what branding does for a product.  


Im drinking some right now. 
Pacific cooler capri sun was also a staple
Sadly, 10 years ago was 2004. Not the 90s. 
[WELCOME TO YOUR DOOM!!](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbsite/)
Cue link to spacejam website
Yes.

Yes.

Were you in my scout troop?
Out of the box axis and allies with no house rules or a bid system. . . .Russia could crush Germany before Germany knew what happened. That is why eventually most people adopted a bid system, like I'll agree to play as the axis if I get 7 IPC's worth of units to place on the board before turn 1.

With all the new versions that have come out the balance has gotten better
If you want a PC game that simulates WWII on the same scale, but in even more detail, you should check out Hearts of Iron.  It's a series of games (the fourth of which is on the horizon) by the same people who made Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings.  HOI 3 is probably my favorite game at the moment.
The best games were when Moscow and Berlin fell within the same turn cycle and the game turned into massive tank maneuvers across Eastern Europe between Japan and the Allies.
Best Korn song for my money. 
Swallow (Surge)
[No, they didn't invent Santa Claus.](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/cocacola.asp)
First album when it was released was pretty rad at the time. After that, you're right, it slid down hill on a jet-powered toboggan.
Faith, Stuck, Counterfeit, Nookie, Break Stuff.... I'm not ashamed to say Limp Bizkit had a handful of really good songs.Ok, I'm a little ashamed. 
Filter was destined to be great, there's Nine Inch Nails in there. Orgy had what ... one or two good songs? And weren't they covers? And Limp Bizkit, well, they had a sound I'd never heard before. That first album was pretty good because they experimented with song structure. After that, they became the alpha numetal piece of shit that they continue to be today.
Surge was released in 1997, remained popular well in to 2000. $3 Bill was released in 1997 which was probably their only original (good) album.

I might be fuzzy months off, but Surge and the emergence of Limp Bizkit hover around 97-98 heydays of my youth. 

I'm surprised you didn't call me out on Korn's second album being released late '96.
> If I see Surge at the store, of course I'll pick up a bottle/can

Well you won't be buying any Surge then. It's all being sold through Amazon... as the title of this post states. 
I skipped most of my statistics classes, but I am pretty sure that this is a logical conclusion.
Surge debuted in 1996. Did they discontinue it before it launched?
Coca Cola has a lot to do with it, though.
On the other hand, we've had how many new mountain dew in the last 20 years?
It's been discontinued for like half that..... Hell, it wasn't even released originally until 18 years ago. 
No.

I hate people sometimes. I hope surge comes back in a big way and all the scalpers are left with is a lot of soda they can't sell. 
aaaand just like that it went from 1-2 days to available Sept 19 haha
At the time, most of us thought it was better. No idea if that opinion would still hold these days, though. 
mountain dew had always been around.


Surge was something different, it was sorta special to me as a child for some strange reason. The taste was great and the color was pretty awesome. We used to go bike down to the store and buy a 2L for 89c  or $1 or whatever and other snacks during the summer and play videogames or sit on the computer or whatever. It has a connection to a lot of great childhood memories
It was better.  I mean it was worse but better.

It was like drinking this super-sweet citrus-ish concoction that made your body a bit repulsed with you.  But then as soon as you swallowed, my god the after taste was like a hint of heaven.  In that shining moment you knew you needed more Surge.  
IMO, it was way better. I can't stand Mt. Dew green. (Red is okay.) But I couldn't get enough Surge back in the day.

They may have been marketed to the same crowd, but to me they taste nothing alike.

What gets me is that Coke keeps discontinuing this stuff (Surge and then Vault) in favor of pushing Mello Yello. Mello Yello also is not even remotely the same thing and tastes even _worse_ than Mt. Dew!
It wasn't a clone. It tasted different. In retrospect, I can't say if it was "better" or not, but I hope to get some and find out. I just remember drinking it a lot when I was in high school, so that's where the nostalgia comes in for me.
In all honesty, it was pretty terrible. It's nostalgia. The 90's were a strange decade full of neon extreme awesome rebellious dudes and Surge vs Jolt was a great debate in high school. For the record, I was a Surge guy, because as bad as Surge was, Jolt was completely wretched. Almost as bad as Pepsi.
I have memories of drinking it at the bowling alley with my friends. We would get slap happy hyper from it. I want that feeling back. 
Thanks Buzzfeed...

Norways economy is outperforming ours as well.  Coincidence?  Probably, but clearly Obama hasn't explored all options!
This was/is sold only in Norway? Holy crap, the rest of the world have missed out!
The BEST energy drink, holy shit so good.
It never went away. We have had it since 1996. The only thing that went away was the 0.33cl cans and the 1.5l bottles, but the 1.5l came back in 2008. The 0.5l bottles never went away though.
Its been on the market for many years as 0.5L bottles, but a couple of years ago they started selling the 1.5L bottles again.
Hence the s in parenthesis.
Hey! Do you wanna do a trade or something? I could send you some American-exclusive snacks and you could send me some (S)Urge and other treats from your country?

Or... Does any other Norwegian out there? 
I think this has the potential to be pretty cool. PM me if interested!
I know that there is a subreddit for this but I can't for the life of me think of what it's called! :(


YES! 

And then get Little Caesar's to bring back the Big Big Cheese and Domino's to bring back the Dominator, for a return to the early '90s battle of gigantic pizza superiority. 
My mom still talks about that Bigfoot pizza. 
Awesome. I thought I was the only one on earth who remembered that.
No worries. Amazon had a limit on how much they could sell in the first day. Should be available again tomorrow. 
There are warehouses in a lot of countries. In  the US it's mostly in the east side of the country. The FC (fulfillment center) is pretty much a huge storage building. 3 floors and and other areas full of random items. I'm a picker, so I'm constantly going around and picking your order(s). We walk around 15 miles or more a shift. I'm actually at work right now, so I have to go.  If you have any  questions, then ask! I'll answer some we I'm on lunch break.

Nah, let it ride...

NAZI!
Thank you! I found out about  crystal Pepsi after I moved to United States,  and they had stopped making it by then. I found out about it because a friend of my friend had an unopened bottle in collection and for some reason the clear cola concept made me want to try it real bad. Thanks to you now I will be able to. Off to Amazon! 

Edit: Thanks to spending time in reddit I saw the name Not see cola and read it as Nazi cola.  
There is absolutely no way I'm buying anything with that label. I don't care if it's the nectar of eternal life.

Whoever's behind their marketing is an idiot.
If you guys are starting a movement you should probably know that it was called Crystal Pepsi, not Crystal Clear Pepsi.
[Here's a link to the not crappy version of the page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M2OGS08). Currently sold out though. 
Ahhh yes... that's it!  I could vaguely recall it had something to do with one of the ingredients.  Doesn't make sense why Surge was singled out.  Maybe it was Mountain Dew smear campaign lol.
Nice! hhaha
Are the labels on most consumer goods printed in English or is it just because it's an American product?
The flavors are so realistic, too! The Triple Rush tasted exactly like a real triple rush!
Surge is good, and Serj. Wake up!
...I don't know what the hell I'm doing. 

That's why.
It's a piss-poor attempt to karma whore.

I just blended a can of vanilla coke zero and cherry coke zero and I must say it tastes like America.
Coke Vanilla Zero is the best god damn coca-cola there is. 
They also cross contaminate like a motherfucker. I can't stand going to places that have those now because every time I get a regular Coke it tastes like complete ass. In fact it all tastes like ass. Hints of orange, vanilla, cherry, and god knows what else, it's gross. 
If anything, having a surge made you even more tired, because you always had to scream, "SUUUUUUUUURRRRRRGE!" and then sprint across an alley with a bunch of couches and furniture on the way just to get one. 
We have (s)Urge energy drinks in Norway... I just bought one today! :) 
An energy drink version exists in norway, where it's called "Urge Intense" http://www.coca-cola.no/nordic-corp/cc/no_NO/pages/products/urgeintense.html

Beverly.... so disgusting.. so bitter.
What exactly *is* Beverly anyways? 

It tasted like soap mixed with cloves and other herbs. 
Oh, but that sweet sweet [VegitaBeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VegitaBeta)
Yeah. I went there a few weekends ago and machine gunned every single tap. There were some I tasted where I had to stop, process them for a few seconds, and shake them off before I could continue.
Oh man how did I forget about Vault? I loved it so much.
You mean "Surge wannabe" ?

We did do scouts...
I read along amused until you said scout troop.  Playing axis and allies at lock ins must have been some unwritten merit badge.
There are new versions? What does it change?  I would be very interested to know because this was a favorite game of mine to play as a young lad. However, many of the games ended up the same so we definately instituted some house rules. 

One time we allowed the units to be placed where ever we wanted on our territories. 

We would typically allow an extra infantry unit or tank on a transport ship as well. 

I also remember us doing something with the submarine combat mechanics at dome point but i can't remember. I Def wanna see what they have done with the game since.  I yearn for a better computer version as well. 

Russia could crush Germany? Care to elaborate or give me some links, with the old version of Axis & Allies I saw the Russians always as the weakest force, doomed to produce soldiers and a tank here and there to hold back Germany as long as possible. We never let anyone new to the game get Russia, as usually they would loose quite fast to Germany and be out of the game.
I just watched a tutorial and this looks awesomely detailed. However, it also looks like something I would sink way too many hours into. 
My secret move was to have the USA spend heavily on secret weapons early in the game.  It was always fun to nuke the crap out of Germany every turn.
Even better! People are under the illusion that they invented the modern description of Santa. The company remains silent on the matter, and thus Coca-Cola further cements itself in the public consciousness in even the smallest of discussions.
I popped in an LB album about a month ago on a road trip with my wife. I'm sad to report that it indeed sucked ass.
*yeah, really good*

No, it was around for a few years.
"Oh no, I'm stuck with 100 boxes of delicious soda"
When the Twinkie went temporarily extinct, I was lucky enough to get my hands on a couple boxes of them and devil dogs. I froze the twinkies and right before the expiration date I checked and they were going for barely anything. I was king of the office the next day passing out twinkies and devil dogs to the unwashed masses. 
>Coke said it may expand the drink to other retailers and add to the campaign, depending on how consumers react. 

I'd assume that selling out of stock will be taken as a good reaction.
Maybe apple was hired for product distribution?
I think half the reason was because it had so much caffeine in it, you'd get hopped up quick. 
Plus growing up, there was always an urban legend that a kid drank a whole case and died from a heart attack. So that made it more badass. 
It was *twenty-five cents*.  Even us poor kids could scrape together $0.25 a couple times a week.  That's what made it better than Dew.
So it's like Slurm from Futurama?
Mello Yello is fucking terrible.
Nowadays, there isn't much difference between the two.

The marketing in an interesting way was kind of ahead of it's time. I guess we were in one of the test markets for it, but it seems like not many people had exposure. 

Tasted pretty good too.
What time did they go on sale today? I'm just going to get up and sit at my computer and wait.

I think it started as some kind of mom campaign against Surge (because it 
was/is pretty bad for you) and then it went kind of haywire. But I have no source to back that up in any way. 
The schnozberries taste like schnozberries!

Damn Canadians, always blending things.
How hard is it to do 0.5 seconds of water, then water+syrup, then follow each press with 0.5 seconds of water to keep the lines clear?  Sounds like it would be easy to design these to prevent cross contamination.
Just a bit of history with a happy ending: 'Ecto-cooler' was renamed 'Shoutin' Orange Tangergreen' in 2001, and renamed again in 2006 to 'Crazy Citrus Cooler'. In 2007, 'Crazy Citrus Cooler' was discontinued and is no longer being sold. 

Luckily, the boys down in Ghostbusters: Chicago Division, came up with a [homemade replica-formula](http://ghostbusterschicago.com/content/ecto-cooler-recipe). This recipe is said to "taste exactly like the original". 

Edit: A friend loaned me his spare quotation mark. Thanks, /u/Waffleophagus! have a nice day, bro!

I have learned to take shots of Beverly without making a face to convince newcomers to try it and watch the reaction they have.  It brings me happiness.  
That shit almost ruined my trip to Epcot.
Anything like [Moxie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie)?
Is it like a Coke-branded chinotto? Man, that shit tastes just like a more bitter version of cough medicine.
I moved to ATL after I was done with college for close to 6 years. One of the clearest memories I have from that time was going to the World of Coke with my friends. They built up how wonderful Beverly is and how it was going to be life changing. They all watched with looks amusement as I took my first sip. Bastards.
I miss vault. I used to mix equal parts Vault, Sprite, and blue Powerade to create the best soda ever. It tasted like the mega evolution of Baja Blast Mountain Dew.
It was basically Surge without the OJ in it.
It's Dr Pepper.  Turn in your Texan card.

You spelt "kicked" wrong.
And a shortened lifetime supply of beetus
Surge had less caffeine than Mountain Dew. It was the marketing campaign that made everyone think that it got you hopped up, which is 1) why it was so popular, and 2) ironically what got it pulled from the shelves.
Urban legend around my area about Surge was that it made your balls smaller and lowered your sperm count.
Virtually the same amount of caffeine and sugar as Mountain Dew. I think the hype is mainly due to the nostalgia as it's been discontinued (until today) for like 13 years so in most people's minds, Surge is synonymous with childhood and the 1990s. Plus it was bright green! And the commercials were epic!
They put a $0.25 surge machine ing high school. Unlike the other coke machines, it didn't shut down during the lunch periods. 

I never did really like it but it was cheap. 
Right down to the beautiful radiation green color.


Its pretty clearly inspired by Surge

Cmon guys, Ecto Cooler is still sold as Orange Tangerine Juicy Juice. Minus the green food coloring, of course.
The original name in the 80's was Citrus Cooler, then around the 2nd Ghostbusters movie they renamed it Ecto-cooler.

There are few things I want more in my life than the return of Oreo-O's
I've heard that you can get them if you have connections to South Korea. Apparently they are still produced and sold there.
Me too! I loved these things! They made the milk so good
More of a 4chan thing really.  They kept calling Gamestop and asking to preorder Battletoads.  More recently, they repeatedly called Pawnstars to ask for it.

Back when I worked at Disney World, we used to try to convince kids that drinking 40 Beverly shots in a row won that person a free t-shirt.  

It was the College Program.  We were poor.  Entertainment had to be found somewhere.
And now I have a new life mission. I must master this.
I do this too. It's a rite of passage. So much fun to do to my friends / family. 
The only drinks that take its taste out of your mouth are the Asian ones. The Chinese and Japanese drinks will remove that shit flavor that the Italian drink leaves. 
Going to Epcot in October, where can this drink be found?!
I've actually had the displeasure of drinking both Moxie and Beverly. Full disclosure that I abhor bitter tasting things so my opinion of both is entirely negative. Moxie was worse.
Are they gonna have a female slimer, too?
Whoa...troop 376?!  

Nope, not anywhere near there. Sorry to disappoint, reddit. Northwest Illinois for me.

We're just the same person. 

Edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger. I don't know what to do with it...
Answer. Now.
*Eagle River!?!?*
Is that what I missed out on by never joining the scouts?
its been awhile, and I believe they have an even newer version out now... but I have the Original, and the 2005-06 version... 

They changed the map. They made a huge dead zone (no movement through it) in Africa for the Sahara. They Redistricted most of the boarder between the German and Russian fronts.

They also added in Sub Destroyer ships, and Forward Artillery that buffed your infantry when defending.

I just bought that Juicy Juice last week and it's nothing like Ecto Cooler!  It's pretty sweet but not saccharine sweet like the Hi C.  We need the original back.
But is there a fucking Slimer on the box? IS THERE?!?
I'm going to the grocery after my A&P test... If you are wrong I will find you...
*Why are we whispering?*
Is this about that box in your closet with Cleveland on it?
As long as Reeses Puffs are on the shelf, I will survive.
Aren't they still sold in Worst Korea?
Those and French Toast Crunch. I haven't been able to find that for YEARS.
The return of Rice Krispie Treats cereal to all major grocery stores?
Yep. I'm currently living in SK. I feel like an international Oreo O's dealer, because I'm constantly sending packages of them back to the US to anyone who requests them.

Me and my best friend got a heads up that Pepsi Blue was being discontinued. So we pooled our money together and bought as much as we could. Luckily one of the grocery stores in town was having a big sale on it. 2 dollar twelve packs and 75 cent two litres. We had enough to last us another 6 monthes. I miss that blue sludge :-(

I don't think entices people to eat Arbys
That's not a sign, that's a tarp with an advertisement on it.
World record: stupidest restaurant publicity stunt 

Saved you a click 
Had some pretty mediocre sex behind an Arby's once. Went inside after and got some curly fries and a bacon cheddar. Then after I went around back again and we had round 2 lol
Come on Arbys be cool
Make a 5 acre billboard but use a tiny font leaving most of it blank.  SMH
A Guinness Record for Arby's would be the "Roast Beef" actually being made completely out of real beef.
What a stupid thing they did. 

“Arby’s food sucks so maybe this sign will be a great idea” 

- said the dumbest marketing executive ever
Frankly I'm shocked they switched from Pepsi considering how wildly successful their "Arbys. We have Pepsi." Campaign was.
That BBQ bourbon chicken sandwich they have right now is pretty good. 
I would have guessed meth but if they say they have coke...
Na I refuse to shop at Pepsi stores.  So it's either get a roast beef with no drink or go somewhere else.  Mountain dew and Pepsi are horrible drinks.
Ah yes coke, I’m sure that will really fix all their food tasting like sweaty asshole. 
All publicity stunts are stupid.  Making a 5 acre sign is impressive.

2 rounds of bacon cheddars and curly fries. How do you do it?

I was baffled when I went through Arby's about a month ago and they told me they didn't have mountain dew.

I'm curious to see how Reddit's cognitive dissonance plays out on this one. 
This is HUGE, Elon Musk is going to be working with Trump ....  I don't care what your opinions are on Trump, he is trying/planning to run the country like a business,  and I'm interested to see how it turns out. 

 Although I don't like some of his views, I've been very satisfied with many positions he has appointed certain extremely qualified people to do. (other then the EPA) Overall I think the next 4 years will be very interesting.  
As expected, this isn't hitting front page instantly, whereas negative news about Trump skyrocket within minutes. 

This is great news, but that's probably why it's still so low on the list. Damn it reddit.

Is the Pepsi exec heading the department of health? Or maybe [the department of education?](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTe8Kgdq8c5fyWqAOnba7cwHvbDEM7sBsJxjF4vtcMKgQDiBMBKCYQYkBYIVw)
A government of corporations for corporations! 
Jokes aside pretty sure PepsiCo is a much bigger company than Coca-Cola
I expect to see this on a late night show very soon.
I live in Atlanta. Wtf is Pepsi?
You know that is really odd, behind the scenes, Coca Cola has many more Jesus Warriors than Pepsi. 
We need smart people whispering in the presidents ear. 
Uber is a super dickish company.

There is no doubt the cab business needed to be changed, but Uber [has been](https://stallman.org/uber.html) a fairly 'evil' company.

PepsiCo also is way too big, so I am not sure how much I agree that it's a great pick. They will likely try to push for policy that helps mega corps remain mega corps or merge to become even bigger.

SpaceX/Tesla are pretty cool since they will (hopefully) push for policies that will empower smaller companies to compete.
So long as they don't try to sell planes to Pakistan at 7,000,000 pepsi points a piece. 
If you're in an oligarchy, definitely.
Except for the fact that PepsiCo is responsible for mass deforestation due to palm oil. Same deforestation that contributes to climate change. Maybe not 100% great picks.
I mean, what better people to inform Trump on populist economics than billionaire CEOs?
they're worthless positions.

> aims to give industry input on the private sector to Trump

he doesnt even go to security briefings. i doubt he'll attend the meetings with these industry guys
I hear they're the best middle-out software company in Silicon Valley. 
Consider the humble cat.
Or some useful team venture with NASA
[deleted]
Wow, really? That's bad news for ULA
This is a great combination. On one had he's got a stalwart like PepsiCo and on the other he's got cutting edge companies that can lead us into all kinds of new directions and innovations. 
Is there a reason we can't have different opinions that are also valid?

Jeez.
I mean it's hard to say as this article has zero context and is little more than a paragraph. 
Believe it or not, Reddit is actually made up of millions of smaller individuals called "people", and these "people" have different beliefs and opinions.  
  
So maybe, just maybe, it's not cognitive dissonance but different people with different views.
I'm happy with these. these and Mad Dog are the only appointments I'm ok with so far, but these are good. 
This is the best news I have heard all week!
Well, I've seen several Trump supporters so far who take the appointment of Musk as **the definite argument** that Trump is totally pro-science, and not a simple Global Warming denier.

In the end, it's an advisory position, and Musk's position on it is not unexpected. He's a relatively important person who leads several innovative compagnies that pride themself on using American labor. Fits pretty well with the rest of Trump's policies.
Look at any of the engineering related subs and you'll see the people that work for SpaceX/Tesla hate their lives. Reddit gets such a boner for these companies (and Elon Musk), not realizing that these achievements are built on a foundation of abusing their employees. 
Reddit will find a new "End Games", "Apocalyptic", "Burning World" Trump fear campaign.
I'm definitely having some palpitations.
what door?
Most of the commenters on /r/politics are saying that this is a good move.

I'm seeing an awful lot more people chortling at cognitive dissonance than actual cognitive dissonance.  
Government is not a business. Libertarianism only works for people that already have what they need. 
His NASA, EPA, Department of Energy and Department of Education appointments are literally the most unqualified people for their positions.

Rex Tillerson, his SoS, has massive conflicts of interests when it comes to Russia and Jeff Sessions, his AG, was too racist for Alabama.

His best picks were Mad Dog Mattis and his Chinese ambassador. Elon is a solid pick for his business council though - but saying he has appointed many qualified people to their positions is just straight up delusional. 

Not to mention that the man is ignoring his intelligence briefings because he knows more than 17 intelligence agencies combined.

Edit: Ah, the Trumplettes are here, downvoting. Don't even get me started on Steve Bannon as well.
You're not a jerk. You were being logical. Liberal's are behaving just like Republicans after Obama took office in 2008. It's just that it's even more annoying with Libs because they have pop culture to back them up. And pop culture is very good at dramatizing nothing.
Liberals are acting exactly like Republicans after Obama was elected in 2008. That is ALL this is. 

Dems now have their "Thanks Trump" meme to play with.
Calling it now:

>Obviously a South African spy influencing American Politics to bring apartheid to the USA
Highly doubt that's going to happen. Musk is a genius, he knows better than to mess with a country's democracy - unlike the CIA.
I'm going to hold off until I learn Elon's private motives, not just his public ones. 

Take for example, in Elon Musk next press conference, before he comes out this music starts playing https://youtu.be/t7wJ8pE2qKU?t=57s (except instead of 'Sephiroth' the song says 'Elon Musk' ) 

Everything is all flames and metal and Elon comes out in a flamboyant steampunky power armor suit. Elon Musk makes a very short put impactful speech. He has decided humans are too foolish to govern themselves, and therefore he will take over and rule the world. 

From behind him a fleet of flying super cyborgs fly out, controlled by the Mobile-Eye AI. Everyone in the crowd flees in terror as Elon remains motionless behind his suit and helmet. All the Teslas and Rockets Elon made over the years activate and join. The AI cyborgs starts dominating all cities and then countries one by one. Resistance is futile.

During this time, 5 freshmen from 5 different colleges watch the whole thing on their computers, and continue to watch the horrors unfold over the years. 

-*continued in next comment *-
I for one welcome our ~~reincarnated Nikola Tesla~~ new overlords.
The best part is these are people who actually understand what it's like to work for something. People that have successfully implemented processes, cut costs, generated profits, CREATED JOBS (anyone). Not a bunch of career politicians that know how to get reelected. I don't like trump. But I have more faith in the private sector than the government. These execs aren't all cut from the same cloth either. They represent different industries, with different goals, and have different ideas. 
Being successful in one field does not neccesarily translate to another.  

And when you have (for example) a cabinet member show says they are not qualified to run a federal department..that's telling.

A person who doesn't listen to environmental sciences running the EPA.  Not good.

A woman who has absolutely zero experiences with public education (professionally or personally) running the Dept of Ed......bizarre.

These people certainly have ideas, and it's to strip away regulation at the expense of the middle and lower class for profit.  #MAGA!!

Uber's  plan to replace all drivers with self driving cars when allowed 
For what it's worth, I remember Bill Clinton taking a drink from a Diet Coke, or maybe Diet Pepsi?, when doing one of those talks about the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Oh come on, he can do better than Pepsi.

"Donald Trump here for Oxiclean!"
What? Do you have a business degree? No bullshit you say?
The government isn't suppose to be run like a company.  The purpose is not to produce something and make a profit.  The purpose of government is to protect the interest of the citizens.
Good. Having different views around you is a great thing. 
ENERGY and oil industries.

You do realize those company heavily invest in renewable energy, right?  As long as they make their cut off the top, do you think they really care where that energy is sourced from?
Almost like... America might be trying to be energy independent... What's next? Producing all our own food? Might explain why the [DOJ just busted up a seafood price-fixing monopoly.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-charges-brought-investigation-collusion-packaged-seafood-industry)
Pepsico makes tens of billions in revenue per year and the other two don't?
Cursory google search shows pepsi co wins out in revenue only and coca-cola has higher assets, equitt, and net income. 

Makes sense since pepsi specifically under cuts the hell out of coke to make sure their beverages are in as many franchise/chain restaurants and fast food places as possible. 


Edit because I'm a dumby

Edit 2: I get it guys theres all kinds of reasons Pepsi is in lots of places. I work in the service industry and one thing I'll tell you is that "is Pepsi okay?" Is probably my most use phrase other than "good evening." Also Pepsi does specifically undercut coke, it may not be why they are in a great many specific places but that's why it's in my restaurant and quite a few others that I know of.
Pepsi also belongs to the Yum umbrella corporation that also includes chains such as Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and Long John Silver's.
How could they not be with all the revenue from [Pepsiman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsiman_(video_game))?
Doesnt Pepsi own YUM! ?
Not based on market cap. KO is worth 26 billion more.
It's what people drink when they don't have soda pop
They make Mountain Dew, not sure what else though.

I'm not afraid the whispering people aren't smart, I am afraid these people do not hold the interest of the country or its people in mind but rather their own self interest.
We need smart people to be the president.
Making sure his actions are profitable to them...
To check for echos?
I doubt he'll listen,it's for show
So what you're saying is that there is an equal representation of climate deniers, climate change recognizers, big corps, small corps, and varying degrees of success from a few pretty different industries? Kinda sounds like a nice change actually. Group might actually be able to advise Trump from different aspects and view points so that he can make an educated decision on policy to push to congress that doesn't completely side with one argument.

Edit: Spelling and grammar 
Go team Venture!
That'd be nice. 
When humanity goes to mars they will have Self driving ride shares.
They will (theoretically) once the new plant goes online, they don't currently.
Not really.  ULA's major customer is the Air Force who values reliability (ie companies that don't blow up on the test stand) over being cheap.
Isn't Peter Thiel also advising Trump? He's Jesus equivalent in SV and I've always looked at him in high regard. 
Because something something hitler and racist 
Yes, but r/politics isn't made up of millions of smaller individuals with unique perspectives. It's a liberal circle jerk. Appointing Musk isn't even on the front page their. 
Shh you're going against the hivemind
Nikki Haley is also a good choice. 
Tillerson seems like a very practical man who values stability very highly. 

Also brilliant, and deeply understands geopolitics and strategy. Not a bad pick at all for State imho. 

Flynn is similar, even if he  comes off as a wildcard in public.

From what I gather in the SE/CS subs is that employees at SpaceX, Tesla, even Uber work a lot of hours and are expected to be extremely invested in their jobs. I've never seen it as abuse though - people are just comparing SpaceX/Tesla to other companies that give great perks to their engineers. 
> Look at any of the engineering related subs and you'll see the people that work for SpaceX/Tesla hate their lives. Reddit gets such a boner for these companies (and Elon Musk), not realizing that these achievements are built on a foundation of abusing their employees.

This is *pure horseshit*.  Prestigious companies *always* work you hard, and compensate you extremely well both in hard cash and exit opportunities.

If they didn't know what they were signing up for, they are idiots.  There's a reason people sign up to work 100 hour weeks in banking, and it's exactly the same for Musk's companies.
Maybe parts of it should be. So much waste 
Libertarianism has nothing to do with running a country like a business. 
What is the fundamental difference that implies such a conclusion?
Trump is not ignoring intellugence briefings. He said he doesn't need to read the same thing in the same words every day, but if something changes, he wants to know about that. 

He also said that others get the same briefings, so it's not like the information is dropping into a black hole. 
>  are *literally* the most unqualified people for their positions.

You think Dylann Roof would be more qualified?
Is it the same though? I just used the wayback machine to look at foxnews around this time in 2008. I can't find any articles tearing apart his cabinet picks. The articles look more like this,"Obama Projects 'Steady Hand' With Cabinet Picks".
> Liberal's are behaving just like Republicans after Obama took office in 2008.

This is **orders** of magnitude worse.  Republicans weren't beating black men in the streets screaming about how he voted for Obama.

Yes they threw a fit, but it was NOTHING like this.
That's a great way to put it. I wish we had some pop culture on our side (people that reflected the fact that america wasn't all shocked and sad nov9 but instead 62 million at least if not half the country was very happy)

We need more media and pop culture than just Fox News 
T_D is doing "Thanks Russia".
difference being that "thanks Obama" was only ever taken seriously be a minority of people


And we will tell them "you're welcome"
I mean you say that, but he wants to get off this shit and go to Mars.

And we're hardly a democracy anyways.  Really, few would likely drive to help our current leaders if we thought they alone were in trouble.
You misspelled FBI

We all know Musk is in Special Circumstances. 
I completely agree with the career pol and private sector comments. I absolutely panic when I see him nominate a politician. 
Our Dept of Ed is a laughing stock. I'll assume you're not supporting status quo here, as it will further separate the middle and lower class from the wealthy. The EPA seems more interested with foreign profits than our health. Case in point: Atrazine and Clothianadin both are banned in the EU, where they are made, and completely legal here. The EPA is working against us and should be distrusted. Sygenta and Bayer spend millions to lobby. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine 
This is the no 1 contaminant of groundwater in the US. YOur water filter doesn't catch this

As for success, it can be infectious. These people have a track record of building a winning team around them. Would you rather have an ideologist running these departments with no management exp or a proven manager running a team of ideologists? That is what is this is about. Not every little nuance of their beliefs or political views. Lets take Puzder for example. Pro illegal immigration. I don't think his belief will gain any traction in this admin. He pulled CKE off the cusp of bankruptcy. My wife works for him and talks to him about once a month. Great guy.

We are stuck in a rut. #MAGA

That's Mr. Yeezus.
If they don't, they'll simply go out of business because self driving taxis are going to beat human driven taxis, without question, unless they're specifically legislated away (which would be wasting one of the most beneficial technological advancements of all time.) 
As someone with interest in urban planning (though I will admit no formal education in it), Uber and Tesla being part of the landscape make me sad for the future of public transit and vibrant urban centers. Doesn't matter if the cars are electric and self-driving, they're still worse for cities than mass transit. 
[Was thinking of more blatant like this](https://youtu.be/vVgvg8EXdFM)
I do actually.  Do you?
Maybe that's when you think inside the box. But you can't deny that the lack of accountability is rampant on the government. And I disagree that the purpose of the government is ONLY to protect the interests of the citizens. It is also to proper administer the assets to ensure it can provide services to its citizens.  And so far it has sucked at it.
So you think the big business oil execs will agree to cleaner energy policies?
Im not really sure why people downvoted me, I just found it interesting that he appointed the Exxon executive yesterday for secretary of state and Tesla today.  They seem at odds with eachother.
Uber is a company that abuses contractor status and skirts taxi regulations. 
>pepsi co wins out in revenue

>coca-cola has higher... revenue

THAT CAN'T BE. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
You must not know about all their acquisitions like Lay's, Yum! Brands, etc. if you spent a few minutes on their Wikipedia page you'd see it's not about undercutting it's about business partnerships. Some of the largest fast food chains in the world were at one point owned by Pepsi 
Important to note that it's almost 50% more revenue, and PepsiCo employs 263,000 people while The Coca Cola Company employs 123,000. 
Most fast food places have Coke. Except the ones affiliated with PepsiCo (KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut). Frito Lay is also a huge source of PepsiCo revenue.
Market capitalization is the typical measure of the "size" of a company. Coca Cola has a market cap of 180 bil, Pepsi ~150 bil.
> Makes sense since pepsi specifically under cuts the hell out of coke to make sure their beverages are in as many franchise/chain restaurants and fast food places as possible. 

Really? I didn't know this and it doesn't seem to be effective. I prefer Pepsi but I see Coke literally everywhere unless it's a Pepsi owned fast food joint. 
Yes, a Pepsi would be even better, as a matter of fact. I only asked for a Coke because I assumed your restaurant catered to the slight majority who prefer Coke for no other reason than brand appeal, disregarding blind taste tests which show that in an ideal world of rational thinkers, no fake news and where nobody buys "Beats by Dre", they would also prefer a Pepsi.
Coke is served in most places that weren't at one point owned by PepsiCo. It's basically the lineup of YUM! Brands (KFC/TacoBell/etc) now, but at one point they were owned by PepsiCo so of course Pepsic was featured at their locations. Coke then used that to get into most of the fast food locations that weren't owned by PepsiCo because they would point out that having PepsiCo products was giving their competition money. Coke only wanted to make soda, and Pepsi was trying to play both sides.
Well coke is better than Pepsi, but I think everyone calls soda coke... or maybe that's just me but I'm gonna say it everybody lol
They do not belong to the YUM corporation. They are separate companies. At one point Pepsi Co owned YUM. Pepsi does own Frito Lay, Quaker, Gatorade and a few other companies, that is what makes them much larger than Coke. 
Umbrella?! They're behind all of this?!?!? It's just never enough for those bastards...
[Pepsiman: now with fixed link!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsiman_(video_game\))

I used to play this as a kid. Same general premise as the mobile game Temple Run, only with a bizarre Pepsi mascot.
Then no longer own YUM brands, completely separate company now.
He listens to everyone. He's heavily influenced by the last conversation he had.  It's very bizarre. Mike Pence was just elected president.
There's a difference between listening to advice and acting on that advice.

Doesnt listen to the briefings.
Or at least feigns paying attention. 
Well Uber plans to replace all their human drivers when self-driving cars allow. 
Pepsi makes bad soda (coke for life)

Got nothing good to bash tesla with
ala Dick Cheney.
> I'm not afraid the whispering people aren't smart, I am afraid these people do not hold the interest of the country or its people in mind but rather their own self interest.

Any project or organization that requires people to "hold the interest of the country or its people in mind" will fail, because humans cannot be counted on to behave that way.

Good organizations make peace with the greed impulse, and harness it. Capitalism for example requires a person to deliver value to others in order to get rich, thus harnessing greed for social good.

In the case of the president's cabinet, you must assume every 
member is only looking out for his company and/or his industry... therefore you should invite a cross-section of them whose combined greed approximately represents the good of the whole economy.

That's the thing I like about Trump, he's open to surrounding himself by people who are smarter in certain subjects and picking their brains for ideas.

Sadly, people like Obama and Hillary often surround themselves with asskissers and Yes Men and cant think outside of the path they're on.
mm I said "smaller companies" not "small corps", Tesla/SpaceX are still very big.

Having big companies like PepsiCo and Uber is not necessarily bad, but if they have a great influence and they use it for the things that really matter for them, and but that harm America as a whole, then it can end badly for us. So I disagree that they are 100% great picks.
> So what you're saying is that there is an equal representation of climate deniers, climate change recognizers,

this must be why Trump wants the names of all the people in the government who worked on climate science and why he appointed a climate change denier to head the EPA. He just wants to make sure they're all balanced! 
I don't know. It's just something /u/crayonofdeath does.
Yah nothing bad with NASA getting a ride to Mars with space X
On estimates we will be to Mars before self driving cars really take over mostly depends on legislation and regulations.
[deleted]
I'll start off by saying my source is Elon Musk's biography by Ashlee Vance. So take that with a grain of salt.

If you take a look at all space programs, rockets blow up all the time. They're incredibly complex and something as simple as on nut being just a couple pounds too tight will bring down the whole house of cards. What I appreciate about SpaceX is that they do not compromise. Elon is notorious for this. Just when dealing with Tesla's Model S he was quoted saying "“We have to decide what is the best sun visor in the world and then do better." 

His rocket program is cheaper because they don't throw away a $100 million rocket every time they launch it. This, coupled with the fact that they build them from scratch in their own factories, and they don't buy parts from other companies, means that they end up making a cheaper rocket that is so cohesive and efficient, it actually trims away a lot of problems most rockets face. The other positive side to this is that they can build rockets much faster and the software and parts can be repaired on the fly. When issues occur with most rockets (at least in the past) it's a major draw back, expensive and time consuming. I believe (someone smarter please correct me here) that when a part needs repaired with NASA rockets, it takes like 3-6 months to fix. SpaceX will simply troubleshoot and repair right on the pad and try again in a matter of mere hours. 

So, cheaper? Yes.

Edit: Typos
Well, my point was that it sounds like ULA needs to find a new engine, aren't they still sourcing RD-180s from russia? 
I think reddit will be forever in love with him for bankrupting Gawker
Yep. Thiel was a great example of cognitive dissonance in tech circles. Gay and a tech superstar.
He is a pretty scary guy...doesn't believe in democracy....seems to believe in controlling and monitoring the masses.
Very smart guy but his ideas are a bit nuts for a guy with the power he now has
Despite him thinking that women's right to vote is bad for the libertarian cause and all?
Barely made front page here also, interesting 
Tillerman has profound conflicts of interest with Russia, you know. Not to mention having been at the forefront of funding fake science "disproving" climate change.
Flynn believes and like to spread random conspiracy theories.
Any cutting edge job in any field will be tough and full of long hours, and tech is no different.

If you want to sail by, go to a more established company.
It also offers future job security and a leg up on the hiring process.
There's an argument to be made there in regards to efficiency. But it seems like what we really need is transparency and accountability. 
Oh please, the intelligence community is hammering him for ignoring his briefings. He needs to be caught up to speed on a multitude of geopolitical issues - some of which we might not even know of. Geopolitics is something that can shift day to day, and Trump needs to pay attention - in fact, Trump is a massive hypocrite because when Obama won in '08, Trump (falsely) criticized Obama for skipping his daily briefings. Cognitive dissonance to the max. 
He'd probably be just as qualified as them. 
lol, dig a little deeper maybe. Try youtube too. "Thanks Obama" is a thing because of the alarmist rhetoric the Right preached with regards to Obama.
they threw a fit for 8 years lmao
Maybe. Alternatively that could push both sides towards being even more agenda driven to the point of cringe on a second-to-second basis as opposed to minute-to-minute.

We need less Fox news, less NPR, less Limbaugh, less Vice....less all that nonsense and more straight up objectivity.

Well if all you associate yourself with is Democrats, then yeah it probably only seems like a few. Unfortunately my job at the time had me in contact with a steady influx from both ends of the spectrum and they loved to shoot the shit about politics.
The US has never been a democracy. Why do people keep thinking that?
I don't blame him for wanting to take humanity to mars, have you seen the shit show we are in? People actually took to the streets to vandalize vehicles, burn the American flag while waiving a Mexican one, and attacked people, all because their candidate lost the election.
i.... ok, im on board
I get to live in an experimental space colony for having dirty thoughts?

Count me in!
You're hired. 
There is a difference from changing because the market demands and using people that at the first chance to you replace because that was the plan from the start.
Mass transit sucks though. I'd much rather take a robot uber than sit across from a homeless guy jerking off. 
Well if you read up on musk's vision is that the cars will work like Uber dose currently so you would tap and the nearest car would come pick you up and wisk you along  which could be varied to allow for super easy car pooling. Also they won't have to park in the city center so they can be out of the way until needed so we shall see. 

Maybe a tram system that you can hop on and off without it stopping will crop up since you can mold the traffic around it. You could have lots of tiny 1 seater cars that are 1/4 of the size of normal cars. We won't know till its here what solution they will try.

What services do you feel the government has not provided, and how should the government pay for those services?
I'm not sure. I hope so though. 
They're only at odds with each other if you presume the worst about Tillerson, who's a brilliant man and has a lot of experience that translates directly to State. 
Yeah it could mean many things... but my gut tells me that oil, solar, coal, wind, water, and nuclear might all be able to synergize... to work together instead of ravenously competing. Energy isn't a one stop shopping experience. 
As opposed to what? Specialist aren't generally great administrators. 
I would have went with Lyft myself.
Uber would provide a much better service than the taxis in my area. Fuck Western NY for not allowing Uber. I understand they're less than perfect as a company but I don't think they intended for many drivers to have Uber as their full time job and if drivers do choose so then that's their choice. If someone finds Uber's contractual demands on their drivers to be too much then they shouldn't be a driver.
It's possible if they hired Hollywood accountants. 
Oops aha that's not supposed to be there
Yeah, it's actually a cool marketing story. Coke got into so many places by pointing out if they used Pepsi products, they'd be giving money to their competition.
Arby's (at least all the ones near me), have Pepsi. Only ones I know of that use Pepsi that isn't Yum! Brand.
[deleted]
That is just for beverages, the Pepsi company ($63B) owns Frito Lay and a few other major brands that makes it a much larger company than Coca Cola ($44 B).
Actually market cap is really "how bling am I" in terms of real value. Just see how rapidly it can change from minute to minute. There's lots of ways to measure size, market cap is probably the least useful unless you're buying or selling that companies stock.
Lol salty much there bud? There is a small amount of people whos eyes light up at the revelation we have Pepsi but most prefer coke and some outright change their order for Pepsi. 

The reality is that Pepsi is Sweeter than coke and that's why it wins most blind taste test. Don't kid yourself though they're both syrupy sweet garbage, blind taste tests or no.
[SGDQ](https://youtu.be/C33Xo1hE9XE) is how I found it.

I think Uber moving towards self driving technologies is a very good thing. It'll reduce rates, increase safety from accidents and skeevy drivers and push self driving tech forward faster. Besides I've heard reports that they aren't great if it's your full time job in terms of taking advantage of drivers.
> Got nothing good to bash tesla with

From my friends in the aerospace business, they either love spacex or hate it. It's apparently a bit cultish.
Uh no mate Pepsi for EVER!

jk it's cool if you like coke more
Atoumating urber driving is something bad to bash them with?
GPL violations 
> In the case of the president's cabinet, you must assume every member is only looking out for his company and/or his industry... therefore you should invite a cross-section of them whose combined greed approximately represents the good of the whole economy.

Or... or more realistically they tear the government apart trying to get the most lucrative deals for themselves and destruction of their economic rivals rather than their greed uniting together like fucking Captain Planet. 
SpaceX isn't big by aerospace standards, they are still the new kid on the block in that sector. 
[deleted]
It's from... Nevermind...
I thought you were referring to % of all cars built here, not of their cars. Referring to just their cars is kind of pointless since Tesla is so small comparatively.
>If you take a look at all space programs, rockets blow up all the time.

ULA's Delta IV had one partial failure and Atlas V has a 100% success rate. SpaceX does incredible work, but you gotta give credit where credit is due. ULA now baselines Atlas V at $109M, which is a solid deal compared to SpaceX's 60Mil if you take in account the perfect reliability. 
They are also cheaper because of capitalism....something the industrial military complex in the USA has no idea about. 
The existing USA players were just wasting tax payers money...perhaps now they will actually try to compete 
The RD-180 has already been phased out of construction excepting existing inventory; ULA cannot purchase more engines, but they had a decent amount on hand for operations.  The Atlas V will use the AR-1 engine once the supply of RD-180's has diminished; which is the engine to be used on the successor to the Atlas series, the Vulcan series.
But he also support Trump.

Now that's a silly comment. If being the retired CEO of a multinational corporation meant that you'd have conflicts of interests as a government figure, then pretty much a quarter of all government figures around the world would be disqualified.  

The suppression of climate change isn't good, but Rex had nothing to do with that, he wasn't the CEO back then. He's the one who brought recognition of the reality of climate change as the official policy in Exxon. Heck, he supports a carbon tax, something that was too extreme even for Hillary Clinton.
Yes I've heard he retweeted something. Anything specific? 
Yeah, that's largely what I mean by "exit opportunities."  Having Tesla or SpaceX on your resume is a huge deal, and people are willing to work for it.
Agree with that. Though being CEO of a major corporation is absolutely a qualifier for a cabinet position. We have plenty of political lifers and academics. Diversity of thought isn't a bad thing

“You know, I’m, like, a smart person. **I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day,**” Trump said. He added, “But I do say, **if something should change, let us know.**”

Emphasis mine. He's clearly saying he doesn't ignore the briefings. If things change, he looks at it.

All the coverage of this is just anti-trump propaganda. 
Most of them just grumbled, though they were partially validated when he did some REALLY dumb things.

Again, **NOTHING** on the scale of what the left is doing right now.
It's a democratic republic. We elect representatives to vote on laws, instead of like in a traditional democracies where citizens vote on the laws directly. 
Because "Democracy" is a colloquial catch-all term for representative governments. 
Any intelligent business plans to automate where it is cost effective. There's no reason for them to pretend otherwise.

As soon as they are road legal, automated cars are going to put drivers out of business en masse, and Uber cannot stop that except possibly through aggressive lobbying to stop it from becoming legal. 
Unfortunately that still doesn't solve the problem of congestion, as each vehicle will be carrying only a few people maximum. There are also some routes that are so much more popular that essentially what you've done is replaced one good mass transit route with hundreds of cars traveling the same way. Picture traffic to Fenway park when the green line isn't working, or afternoon traffic leaving Chicago without the Metra lines. Sure the cars won't have to park downtown, but there will still be overwhelmingly more traffic going out of the city at 5 pm. Even if they're automated, there's still a maximum throughput. 
I didn't say they didn't provide services.  But they suck at properly administering taxpayers money, they waste it and they pretty much don't give a shit.  That's why we've had so much waste all these decades.
lyyft master race
They don't provide better service, their contractors do because they don't want to get banned. Uber provides little to nothing while abusing foolish people trying to make money. Obviously taxi rides are going to be cheaper when you don't pay to keep up cars. 
No it isn't. He listed the correct market capitalization for the companies. That includes all brands and assets they own. I have no idea what you posted.
You bet I'm salty. Dr. Pepper and Guaraná Antarctica are much better sugar waters anyway.
Trump ran on draining the swamp and instead has packed his cabinet with ultra right wing ideologues. Pence runs America.
Any media sources I provided you you'd discount so I'd just suggest you look at how many times he changed position during the campaign. Not on like one issue I'm talking about everything. Before it was over he was saying the wall wasn't literal.  
No you are detached from reality. Even people on Trump's side say he has the attention span of a house fly.  It was very evident on the campaign trail.

  Just go back to thefrump.
Neat. Trumps own campaign officials said so. They literally said he repeats what he was told by the last person.
Because he's literally admitted to thinking he doesn't need them on account of being so smart? Because his ghost writer said he couldn't hold his attention for more than five minutes? Because he couldn't even stay on track during an interview and stopped to watch tv five times in an hour? Because his own campaign says he can't focus? 

It's a perfectly valid assumption to think he doesn't listen to the few briefings he takes.
There's huge concerns that self driving cars are going to put truck drivers out of a job, which could be the death knell for many rural communities. It could put the drivers out of a job and the section of the economy that caters to them, out of the way motels and gas stations for example. 

I'm not saying technology is evil or anything, but the potential impact of putting another labor force out of work is pretty scary. 
Well the push is nice but the way they presented it was the current workers are just place holders a o Uber Dosnt really care about them.
And as a bonus, it could sound the death knell of the truck driving industry. Well, I see that as a bonus at least. :)
Can you elaborate? Sounds interesting!
Well its a company lead by a Martian trying to get home not suprised it's a little cultish (trying to be funny)
Why it will reduce congestion because all the cars will know what the others are doing and will be able to drive faster and flow together better no need for wasted time at stoplight because the cars will self manage as a group also you won't have to focus on the gridlock while we make the change over because you have a self driving car.
> Or... or more realistically they tear the government apart trying to get the most lucrative deals for themselves and destruction of their economic rivals rather than their greed uniting together like fucking Captain Planet. 

You're right, they'll destroy the country, by banning their competition (e.g. taxi medallions), or grant themselves a public rent, or request so much regulatory burden that small competitors are crushed by the compliance costs.

The solution to this malfeasance is: do not empower the government to enact such laws in the first place.

The American constitution does exactly that. Unfortunately it became unfashionable during the push to Communism circa 1930 through 1980, and now our federal government admits no restrictions on its power.

To wit: if you grow a tomato in your garage and sell it to your neighbor for a quarter, your behavior affects interstate commerce (in the sense of reducing demand for tomatoes imported from other states) and thus is the jurisdiction of the federal government under the interstate commerce clause.

I'm not joking.
Sure you can compare them to huge companies and they are not big compared to their sector, but Tesla has 30k+ Employees and SpaceX has 5k+.

In comparison, a company that many people might think is "big", would be twitter with a bit over 3k employees.

Google which is huge has 60k+ employees.

So again, to call them a "small corp" would not be correct, they are a smaller corp (compared to industry).
[deleted]
Touché. Those are solid numbers. I don't mean to discredit them. I just appreciate l the way the SpaceX engineers became self taught rocket scientists in an incredibly short amount of time when the stakes were too high for any company to take risks. Especially in something as volatile as rocketeering. Despite these, they developed the first self landing rocket. Something no other program had even tried to develop up till then, or if it was, was met with disheartening results. As it stands, SpaceX's Falcon 9 is at a 93% success rate. 

You're very right, though. Assuming that all cargo shipped to space is incredibly expensive, I'm sure that some people see the $50M price difference as an even price for reliability. 
I'm excited by all the space pedes I'm running into in this sub. That's interesting info, I did not know that! 
Fell however you want and realize you can still like someone and find value in them even though they do or believe things you don't agree with. A lot of us have forgotten this lately. 
Just call everyone a Nazi. Works for the rest of reddit.
I have noticed the left in general has started to marginalize gay men(particularly white gay men).
http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/10/14/peter-thiel-shows-us-theres-difference-between-gay-sex-and-gay

edit: just linking for reference to what many people have said about Thiel.. Don't confuse providing a reference with supporting said reference. (but why should i expect nuance from reddit?)
Shut up and take my money, you fascist?
All 3 combined are nothing compared to r/europe
Well the truth has a liberal bias so
Exxon would benefit tremendously from sanctions being lifted off of Russia; and it's not so much that he's a climate change denier so much as his company was invested in undermining climate science under his watch.
[Here](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/michael-flynn-conspiracy-pizzeria-trump-232227) is a nice article on it.
That's what I'm getting at. I'm not saying working at those companies is all negative. They work their employees extremely hard for much less pay than market value. It's great to have those companies on your resume, but it supports the race to the bottom. 
Some cabinet positions maybe, but certainly not all of them would be best suited by treating them like a corporate office.
Calling Obama out for 'ignoring daily briefings' when he didn't is anti-Trump propaganda? Using his own words against him is anti-Trump propaganda?

Dude, please, when the intelligence community is inclined to believe that he's not taking his briefings seriously, I'm inclined to believe them. Am I to believe now that the intelligence community is behind 'anti-Trump propaganda'? That's just nonsense. They aren't exactly a bastion of liberals in there.
It's actually a representative republic. The labeling of "democratic republic" for some reason has been slowly catching more traction in my short 35 years.
Sorry for so much text

I feel you missed my point Uber was started to make use of self driving cars or early adopted plan where . Uber made all employees contractors and plan to fire them probly the day the legislation for self driving cars drop.

Where taxi companies will make the move when the market forces them. They will end up with an app and self driving cars because you will have to.

I was commenting how how they vies the employees while taxi will have to drop drivers that's not the goal as with uber.
But why would the number of cars have to increase the costs will very may be cheaper to ride a self driving bus  if it's 10 cents to use a bus that reaches where you need to go and same trip is 2 dollars for solo car.
Some people would say that the money was well spent, that's part of the problem of having a huge population with many different opinions.
Taxis aren't cheaper 
just sounds like something John Oliver once said that is now parroted around by his Reddit legion of liberals

I dont believe in having jobs for the sake of keeping busy.
A huge portion of the labor force too.  Estimates are that around 10% of total jobs involve transport.  Lots of them won't be lost, but the human side will be, and lets be honest, there won't be enough new jobs to offset the huge loss of human drivers and their support. 
Wasn't the implementation of the highway sysyem something that did the same thing to towns?

....I watched Cars
It's going to be a very long time before trucks can be truly driverless. General public will not tolerate a 18 wheeler with no driver in it taking out a family of 4 in a minivan, even if driver-less trucks are statistically safer. We may see human-supervised trucks though. 
In time I'm sure that will come to pass. It's not an if, it's a when. Automation is going to change the entire way our society functions and if we don't identify this and find a way to use it to our collective advantage what will happen is that the massively wealthy will use the automation to profit until an eventual collapse of the economy.

There's a reason Elon Musk supports the idea of a guaranteed basic income, he sees what's coming in the future and wants to avoid a total breakdown of society.

Instead of saying "This could hurt millions of people" we as a society need to say "How can this benefit as many people as possible" Whether people like it or not we either need to head to a dystopian future where the tycoons made billions on automated products while the middle/lower classes get increasingly impoverished or we move to a more collective (and some would say socialist) society where we work together for the good of the whole.

Granted there will be people who will take advantage of such a system but culturally we can foster an environment that discourages that as much as possible.

TL;DR: I believe that capitalism+automation=dystopian future of opulent wealth and widespread poverty
I think when people talk about this, they often forget about what you just mentioned -- every part of the economy that services truck drivers.  So many old food spots are going to go under very quickly.
Automation is already sorta the biggest killer of jobs for a long time. Who knows what the eventual solution will be. Jobs for the sake of jobs? Guaranteed basic income? More jobs come from unexpected areas and there's no problem in the end?
>There's huge concerns that self driving cars are going to put truck drivers out of a job, which could be the death knell for many rural communities.

This is one of the few things I have to look forward to from Trump.  Its time for small towns that aren't agriculture to just die already.
I don't get why people expect Uber to treat drivers like the same way corporations treat full time employees..... it was clear from the start that you're paid by the job and that's it. As Uber can reduce costs and reduce the need for human drivers of course they're going to move in that direction. Completely autonomous cars are many years out so there's plenty of time for people to adapt and change their lifestyles accordingly so it's not like they're dumping half a million jobs in one day (completely made up number)
At least they're honest. 
I know one guy who interned at spaceX and one who interned with NASA. The spaceX guy loves it, and the NASA guy thinks spaceX is too reliant on people only doing it for the experience/glory.
You know...my SO calls him Space Jesus, and says exactly this. O.o....
For the most part gay men are left.  They do it to themselves. Yes there are non left gay men but they aren't as loud.

Huh not as loud mutiple ways actually.
Not just a gay version of uncle Tom but not even gay now that a great position now the gatekeeper of sexual orientation. Not that I like gay cultural all that much too often. 

If being gay is now just a culture, did he just destroy the concept of discrimination  based on sexual orientation? All while complaining about the bathroom statement.

Actually wonder what the author would say about the Republican caitlyn jenner. Or maybe they will call her/him bruce. I mean they don't think the "right way" so they obviously aren't trans. (Not that the T part of BGLT is sexual orientation anyway)
The "Truth" in politics is literally the most subjective thing ever.


There is no concrete "Truth". Just 300 million people voting on their own definition of the truth.




Hell, it was only a couple 100 years ago where the "truth" was that black people are worth 3/5ths of a white person.
Thanks. Yeah, these aren't worrisome. 

There's a fair grain of truth to every example they give. And we're talking about tweets about political opponents during an election. Spinning it as though he's a conspiracy kook is kookier than what he tweeted, imho. 

Any of these you're actually concerned about? 
Well you didn't dispute that he isn't ignoring them, and are now saying that if they're inclined to believe it, you are too. I've got no problem with that so I guess we'll leave it there.

Edit: *it** being that he doesn't take them seriously. Which isn't ignoring. 
I use that term because it's shorter than saying [representative democratic republic ](https://www.google.com/search?q=is+the+us+a+democratic+republic&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari), we're a combo, not solely a republic, nor a democracy. I imagine the term has gained traction because it's a more accurate description, congrats on making it to 35 btw.
Taxi companies only exist at all because of legislative monopoly keeping out competition like Uber or just independent drivers. 

And taxi companies also will automate insofar as its possible (but it basically isn't all that possible, because the only thing they bring to the table is their legislative monopoly, whereas Uber at least has a bunch of users with apps installed.) 

So I'm not exactly sure your point that Uber is evil is supported by your argument that they'll be quick to axe workers. I have no reason to believe taxi companies won't drop theirs as quickly as profitable, too. 
Very true, and I think that would be my hope, especially since data collection would allow optimization of routes! My concern is that I think a lot of people think of public transit the way u/Feeling_Arkansaucey does, and won't give up the solo ride. People don't like the public, unfortunately. Just look at buses vs transit now - most will choose an uber over a bus that goes the same route if they can afford to, and everyone suffers for that increased congestion.
I don't watch HBO dude. This stuff has been written about endlessly. 

The National Review a leading Republican mouth piece for decades documented his shifting positions on various issues. But I know this won't matter to you. 

http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435096/donald-trump-flip-flops-toward-center
That's not what Bill Gates said at all.
Lol. 

One, It's blatantly clear that you don't have any thing intelligent to say about my comment.

Two, No, Bill Gates did not call him the next JFk.

Three, your obsession with fags and cucks **totally** doesn't make people think you've got sexual issues you're dealing with.
Sure, but what do you think all those taxi and truck drivers are going to do once their jobs vanish? They're not going to have the same philosophy when they're going hungry. 
I'm glad I'll likely be dead before society has to figure out a way to deal with the massive shift of having 99% of jobs be doable by robots. People struggle now with them doing 1-2%.
Its easy to say that when its not your job on the line.
Its more the Interstate system and the concept of having NO stop lights on Interstates.

The highway system built those cities, and then the Interstate system closed many of them down.
I feel it's because it's such a different setup and the controversy about some early issues also if I remember the supreme court said that they cant treat them as contractors anymore.
I mean I don't care if people are doing it for the glory if we get great results because of it. They deserve that glory. 
their was a meme a few weeks back about what if he was a martian and trying to get home.  probably where they got it from.
I was like 75% joking to be honest. But i still disagree with your comment because by truth i meanits backed by facts.
I'm concerned about the fact that an adviser to the President believes in unfounded conspiracy theories, yes.
I'm not supposed to believe the people in charge of briefing Trump that he's not taking it seriously? What? 
funny how one word will change the [google search.](https://www.google.com/search?q=is+the+us+a+democratic+republic&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#q=is+the+us+a+representative+republic) To me saying "representative" automatically implies some type of voting system, so mentioning democratic in the description of our govt seems redundant. 

Either way I'm just being pedantic. We're both correct.
So if you follow the chain to the top the guy was talking about a gig economy and how capitalism loves a disposable workforce and uber's plan from the start to throw away people but they needed to have a presence before self driving happens because then they would be behind the curve. They also just treated drivers  like crap tools from the start. To be thrown out

Businesses are just naturally evil you don't stay in Business Without following the evil path. I just stating they planned it. No for profit business is good just lesser degrees of evil
And if so I see a lot of mini cars that are 1/4 to 1/8 the space. Kind of like a covered scooter because you don't usually need lots of space for stuff
Robot cars will alleviate congestion. Plus we don't have to share rides with gross people, or people in general. 
Find new jobs in a field that there is a demand for workers.  Same as any person who works a job that becomes obsolete.  If automated vehicles are cheaper, safer, and more efficient then theres no reason to keep humans driving them any more than there are reasons to keep travel agents around and shut down expedia etc.  If you're working a job that is obsolete you need to adapt.  

You'll probably mention how theres not enough jobs to go around so  I'll add my reply right now: eventually there will need to be a basic income type system or expanded welfare which I believe to be pretty much the same thing.  The living standard this system will provide should probably increase as automation gets better.  
Become a fleet owner. If your truck drives itself then you can buy additional trucks.
>People struggle now with them doing 1-2%.

1-2%? That's your estimate? Have you ever seen an episode of How It's Made? 

At some point a basic-income type system will have to be implemented.  The how part is the big question.  I think massive welfare and basic income are pretty similar with just a few differences though
> I'm glad I'll likely be dead before society has to figure out a way to deal with the massive shift of having 99% of jobs be doable by robots. 

This is likely only true if you have stage 4 cancer. Things are going to start changing very quickly around here. 
Yup.  I'd probably be pretty pissed if my job was going to be obsolete but thats life.  We could shut down all machinery and do everything by hand to create more jobs but whats the point in that?  Technology should move forward, not backwards.  Its not like driving a vehicle takes years of school or anything either.  You can train yourself for something in demand with the same skill level relatively quickly.
> truth i meanits backed by facts.

"facts" even today are super subjective.


It was a well known "fact" that Iraq had Weapons of mass destruction.


It was a well known "fact" that we a US submarine was hit in the Gulf of Tonkin to instigate a war. 


All the information we get from the media(well MSM at least) are being screened and doctored by many people and everything is calculated. Anything you see on the TV or internet isn't a solid "fact" because it is going through the great filter of the media. 
Which theory is concerning you?  I'm honestly curious, because all of them mentioned seem to be an issue of journalists taking tweets weirdly literally. 
Am I to believe you're under the assumption that these agencies personally hand-deliver their reports to him and watch for his reaction? 
Well Uber is a pretty weak example of it, but alright. I'm not going to try and change your mind from an absurd point of view like "businesses are inherently evil." 
I wasn't really counting assembly-line factory production like that since it's already been going for so many decades. More like people getting upset that say, McDonald's might soon be able to run a chain with no humans inside, just robots doing all the cooking and such. Or driver-less cars hauling goods.
Yeah, as of now people are so hung up on the notion that people receiving basic income will just make everyone give up working and just stay at home all day. And that's just basic income now to cover medical, food, housing, let alone just paying people to be alive while the robots do all the work. 
Yeah, but you have to start over in your new career some of these people are going to have to do so in their 40s and 50s. 

I do agree with you about technology, but I am worried that society will not be able to change with the times and a lot of people are going to suffer for it. 

If we can find a way to get these people good jobs afterwards than that's fine. But we both know that is likely not going to be the case. I do think if we try hard enough we can find gainful and maybe satisfying employment. 
Facts cant be subjective dude come the fuck on. If i say "men having vaginas is a fact" is it factual because i said it was? No im just a fucking liar. 
Why shouldn't the tweets be taken literally?
That's exactly what they do. They sit incoming Presidents in a room and brief them verbally and via printed copies. 
well it was part of its conversation so just went with it. I would love to hear your point against it. I know plenty businesses that do good but every for profit business is made to make profit so even if you make a life saving drug  and make a reasonable price to recoup the cost of r&d say your keep it at the price after you reach have made enough to cover the loss if you "good" you would then  cut the cost of the drug to your cost to make, but businesses want to grow so they need the profits to spend on new equipment to make more medicine to make more money to grow more. That's why businesses are inherently evil I want to use charity as what a "good" business but always bad eggs in that basket.
thanks, but no thanks - I prefer not to get my fiber in a soft-drink form.

The people who can actually do something about it are taking him and his country seriously. Us common folk poke fun at him because that's all we can do really. We see the news and we can be like "oh ok, uh oh, make a joke, or ignore it." We can't really do anything, at all.

US and other governments are the ones that need to be serious, they have the power to make or remove sanctions and declare war. A pleb on reddit can't do that.

He's not 32.

lil kim probably needs 8 swings for 1 hole.

That would be the quickest way possible to lose power (and his life) in either a China-backed coup or Chinese invasion. 
Uh no, North Koreans would never tolerate that kind of treatment. 
"Um, I'd just like to surrender right now." -Kim
Air Koryo (North Korea's only airline) probably has higher satisfaction ratings than United right now. They may be flying on poorly maintained old soviet-era planes with improperly trained pilots, but at least you wont be beat up for flying with them.
the pepsi is a lie?
Pepsi put out an extremely tone deaf commercial that had rioters marching with extremely generic signs a towards a riot police line, and when they meet Kylie Jenner who had joined the march earlier hands a cop a Pepsi and it's all better.
The sanction by China on NK's coal was done last month not yesterday

Protest draft, push for its partial or full restriction. A citizen pays taxes and obeys the law - his part of a social contract is fulfilled, dying in droves for corporate interests without even getting paid isn't a part of it.
The best we can now is negioate for nuclear and missile program freeze like the north has already agreed to in exchange for stopping the yearly drills. Here food for thought, why can't we have South Korea train here instead? Kim thinks nukes will save him from being the next saddam, it's beyond foolish to think they would give up an investment they have been working on since the 60s with millions spent and the only benefit for that a being less sanctions. If we can freeze the program that will buy us time to calculate our next move like regime change or further negiations. Otherwise we will continue to push Kim's people towards starvation which destabilized his regime which could in turn be extremely dangerous as we are pushing the nuclear armed dog into a corner he is stuck in.
Well played.  
Neither of them age
I agree as when I said we, i didn't really mean as a collective people more as our nations stance.
Yeah, NK isn't hitting San Fran
We joke but the government isn't. We poke fun at NK but the US government and its allies are very serious about the threat of NK. Don't think all the jokes you see in the media and on reddit is like it's the voice of the government.
Please take out San Fean this place is a chit hole now. 
Don't let you dreams be dreams. Go and buy some uranium and declare yourself God king. 
The problem comes when the pit bulls stop eating the chihuahua and start fighting with each other instead.
yes sure be over very quick in mean time 1000's if not million are killed and trump turns east china in a middle east shit fest 
why the fuck do anything and for what?
Winky face 
It might even be worse than that for North Korea.  From a "game theory" perspective, it makes a LOT of sense for any pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons to be punished by an overwhelming global response by pretty much anyone with retaliation capabilities.  Hell, it wouldn't even necessarily need to be a *nuclear* response.  Plenty of nations could pummel North Korea to rubble using nothing but "conventional" high-yield weapons, and DKRP would be completely unable to protect itself.

And in the meantime, making a catastrophic example of the first country to go rogue with its nukes would make it a lot less likely that anyone else would *ever* do the same.   It would effectively shift the formula from MAD to just plain SAD - Self-Assured Destruction.  With the worry about the damage a rogue state with nukes could do, the political calculus points to that being an effective deterrent. 
Think so? Im not so sure. I think he is getting desperate now. 
Who knows, maybe it would be enough to wake them up. 
Well you probably will, but at least you expect it and still make it to your destination more or less on time.
Capitalist advertisement is a lie. Pepsi is a tasty truthful beverage invented by Kim Jong Un for the nourishment of Korean People. 
I just got aspergers reading this. 
[Here's the ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGlaqWbqsnU). I don't think it's unusually awful, but that's because I expect commercials to be ridiculously pandering and superficial. It's no worse than the next ad you'll see for an SUV or beer. But of course those are awful too.

The plot is, there's a generic protest, a bunch of beautiful arty people are doing arty things in their respective lofts until they are drawn out into the streets by the protest, one of them is Jenner who picks up a can of Pepsi and then gives it to a policeman who, after a pause, smiles and drinks it, and then everybody's happy. (That last bit almost certainly a reference to images like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_power#/media/File:Vietnamdem.jpg), [this](http://www.marcriboud.com/marcriboud/50ANS/pages/0003.html), or [this](http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2007/03/17/PH2007031701303.html).)

It's kind of amazing that Trump is able to control the narrative considering he has yet to tell the truth about anything. 
Already happened im pretty sure. Ill check and come back.
In her snizz?
Wow, at least enact agnatic-cognatic succession, Kim.
*prepares the probes*
I'd rather the jokes I think.
What exactly do you have to be afraid of?
The context is that we're on reddit. There's nothing a redditor can do, especially in your reply.
>The best we can now is negioate for nuclear and missile program freeze like the north has already agreed to in exchange for stopping the yearly drills.

I'll get right on that.
Thank you, Example 1. 
Why would they? Nobody likes the chihuahua 
If NK launched a nuke at the US, i don't care what Trump does to them. The guy is terrible to his own people. Why would he want to launch a nuke at us anyway? We haven't done anything to him to provoke that.

I don't foresee us going to war with China though. 
You're not sure? They set off a nuke anywhere near Seoul and they're done.
I really can't explain it, you have to go watch it.
Wow....awful.
That make sense then :)

Yeah better to go with a bang!
See folks? Was that so hard?
Backup your claim with some evidence d o l t

I'm not saying they're unjustified, but I imagine our heavy sanctions against NK might piss them off. I mean, we haven't been playing hands-off when it comes to Korea.
>We haven't done anything to him to provoke that.

McCain called their fearless leader a "fat crazy kid". So there's that.
if we attack North Korea first they have every right to defend themselves and I don't care if they lob nukes on the US or their assets
And if he doesn't care and thinks he'll be a martyr for the rest of history?
I actually saw it, in words though, it's even more retarted, which makes me get aspergers thinking of how an ad person thought this was a good sell. 
do ama pls
Gimme a few days, might be able to. 
*raises hand *
Yo quiero taco bell
Who cares, they're a weak country with a 4 foot tall fat headed leader with a bowl cut. He's a bully to his own citizens to the point he won't allow them to use the internet because the people might find out how he really is. He desperately wants to be relevant but no one takes him so because you can't help but laugh when you see him.
I forget he thinks that's grounds for war, lol
We won't be attacking first 
He's already a god as far as the North Korean narrative goes. He has much more to lose.
How does one "retart" something? 
Day 1: San Francisco is still there. Hipsterism is up slightly, but within expected models.
>Why would he want to launch a nuke at us anyway? We haven't done anything to him to provoke that.

You asked why, then said we haven't provoked anything, and then you mock him and insist no one takes him seriously. Do you hear yourself? I'm not defending him or his awful regime, I'm just saying it's not that hard to come up with reasons why they might be mad.
I add a little bit of fruit custard to a prebaked micro pie crust.  re-tarting is def the best way to go. Like several day old spaghetti 
Because he feels inferior and is laughed it?
Yes, and the sanctions too. See? It's not hard to come up with reasons.

It's odd to think of what we put in our bodies, for no other reason than some company told us to do it. 

There are lots of things that humans naturally crave and enjoy - natural food, water, even things like beer, which has been around for millenia., and if made properly, consists of just 4 ingredients.  but coke?  What *is that crap*?   why do people drink it? 

I can understand people beginning to drink it for the actual cocaine that was once-upon-a-time in the mix.  Or the heroin or whatever it was. But now?  What's the point? 

It's a completely artificial, industrially-produced substance. It is not food.  

breathing smoke from burning a plant, or drinking hot water that has  steeped the leaves of a plant - those are somewhat exotic ways to consume natural substances. But they are still natural. Coke is... ?? a chemical.  a liquid produced in a factory.

What exactly is so surprising ? People don't want corporations to be democratically run. 

People admire billionaires. Just watch the Elon Musk/Warren Buffet reddit circlejerk.  People think billionaires are some kind of incredibly good men. Most billionaires are highly manipulative psychopaths. 

Well, here is the result.
Wasn't one of their slogans in the 80s "Have a Coke and an RPG"?
wow Coca Cola can't catch a break, their execs had 50 million euros worth of cocaine delivered to them in France yesterday
Corporate imperialism. Fun stuff.
2017 is the year we find out Coca Cola never stopped putting cocaine in their drinks, and has been funding Colombian drug lords so they could get a steady supply.
Corporations are already richer than entire nations. 

Mussolini... Hitler... Coca Cola... how long until corporations start showing up on other lists?
Remember this the next time you see a gay couple drinking Coke on your TV screen. The people who run these companies don't give a damn about you, what they're feeding you, or what the trend of the day is, be it gay marriage or putting black people in a noose. All they care about is making sure their production costs are low, their sales are high, and that anyone who stands in their way gets bulldozed whether it be by funding AUC or ISIS. Enjoy your Coca Cola.
Pepsi has done no such terrible thing however.

BUY NEW CRYSTAL PEPSI TODAY.

...Okay so when do I get the check?
Christ, more than 50 companies were funding this group? And Coca Cola among them.... My head is spinning. I didn't know that Corporations were that out of control. I knew they didn't pay taxes, and they bribe our politicians, and they write our laws, but now... they also get to peddle drugs and fund extremist groups that are um... killing people.

I expect a SEVERE penalty!!! - Like, you know, one day worth or profits. Kind of like when big oil pays penalties and the cost of the penalty is so low that they will commit the same crimes again because it's actually more profitable to commit the crime than conduct business according to environmental law, etc.
If I were a Pepsi marketing executive I would be all over this. 

The fucking headlines write themselves "Coke sells Coke" 
so does this mean they will be shut down? because anything less would be unacceptable. 
Wait, they're actually going after complicit geopolitical corruption now?

Am I in bizarro world?
If we are starting to charge the backers of brutal juntas and terrorist in south America, then why is Kissinger still walking around free?
>Multinational beverage producer Coca Cola is one of more than 50 companies that will be charged with financing the now-defunct Colombian paramilitary AUC group, a designated terrorist organization.

But why?  Coca-Cola makes billions annually.  What motive do they have?
terrible that a copr gets in trouble when the US government has done the same thing.  Wonder if they can use that in their defense

"The United States of America has at various times in recent history provided support to terrorist and paramilitary organizations across the world. It has also provided assistance to numerous authoritarian regimes that have used state terrorism as a tool of repression.[1][2]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism
I'd like them to do that with PLO next.
Yeah, that site looks reputable.
This was 10-20 years ago. Is there not a statute of limitations?
I'm sure they have lots of evidence
Still better than Pepsi.
Typical, people always want to go after deep-pocketed American corporations rather than seeking justice from those who actually committed the wrongful acts in their country.  These acts were committed by Colombians against Colombians, and if a price is to be paid, it should be paid by Colombians.
yeah, i've always been really curious how the people who actually DID these things totally manage to hide behind the curtain and get away cleaner than clean.
We need to innovate "corporate person prison." Maybe the board can take turns spending a month in a non-white collar crime cell block.
Oh but you fail to see that corporations are people too... Except when accountability comes in the play then they're actually untouchable.

And yet we lose our shit if someone doesn't stand up for the anthem...
Just waiting for the day the courts rule that people are corporations, too. I'll finally stopped getting sodomized by the system and instead receive blowjobs.
Instead of fines the government should just seize an equivalent worth of assets and liquidate them. Some may call that extortion, but hey it's Coca-Cola and they helped fund a terrorist organization so fuck'em.
"corporations are people too, my friends"

so that the people running them will never ever be charged.  The rich dont go to jail for supporting terrorists silly!  They just pay fines then go to sleep on a slightly smaller pile of money that night.

Meanwhile you have the NSA spying on all of us looking for any sort of terrorist connection, destroying our civil liberties.

Rules for thee but not for me!
It's not funny. It's globalism. With TPP all but said and done, this is our future. I used to think the premise of Frank Miller's Martha Washington stories were outrageous satire. It's now reality. 

Nike will arm North Korea with swoop logo'ed AKs. The Red Cross will be swapped for the Starbucks mermaid on war zone ambulances. Baltimore riot police will have the WB logo on their shields. 

10 years max and this will be the norm. 
The government wants money, not people it has to pay to imprison.
don't forget all the merc private armies for global companies running around Africa all because they want to control some land with precious natural resources.  
Which has lead to the demise of the Gorillas in the Congo.
Don't forget BP's "we're sorry".
I had an intro to econ professor say something along the lines of: 

"I don't teach ethics. I teach business. 'Business ethics' isn't a thing." 

The more time goes on, the more I notice how true that statement is. Money is the moral in capitalism. That's it. While I do believe that many high class people actually are honest, no one is questioning those who are lying.
I wonder if it would be legal for the government to fine them, but opt to seize an equivalent amount of assets from the company. Money can be made up again at the expense of everyone except those at the top. Literally taking away physical property or something owned by the company might be a little more harmful which is what they deserve.
And the opinions of half the citizens of western countries? *More* privatisation!!!
Ever heard of a pinto? For anyone who's never heard, google 'ford pinto gas tank'
It is almost like capitalism is a scourge on modern societies, despite bringing them into a healthy existence. Time to push for more socialism fear mongering, by highlighting tiny dictatorships who couldn't afford to run a successful socialism.

Whatever.  Pepsi is better anyway.
AKA imperialism.  Remember that the original imperial powers were corporations (i.e. East India Company in India in the 18th century)
Coca cola through a sister company called the stepan group is the only company in the US that has a lisense to import coca leaves from peru. They use chemicals from the leaves in the drink but its not really cocaine.

No. Probably no one even goes to jail. Maybe one guy.
The 10 year statute of limitations can be extended if there are circumstances that prevented them from filing earlier.

Corporate sponsorship probably helped the terrorists quite a bit.
You must be high or had a lobotomy to spew that bullshit.
That, my friend, is why corporations were created in the first place, to take the fall. 
Are the people who funded the group still at the company?
The reality is the personal assets these board members accumulated while committing crimes should be forfeited. 
I suggest glass dildos be standard issue. 
I like it.
You want to investigate and try every single Coca Cola employee?
We don't.
Some vets took offense.
The media blew it up.
I think it was a poorly executed statement, but am all for the right to do so.
Our ability to be heard means a lot of people speak on issues that maybe should leave that to those more capable, and intelligent.
Oh gorillas you say?

Or GM ignition switch?

What's your complaint about Stalin or Chairman Mao? They weren't hindered by being tiny, and managed to kill tens of millions.

Try serving Pepsi as a mixer at a bar.
Only to people with no taste buds though. ;)
Good point, the American colonies were given to companies as well. Big land grants to... companies.
that is absolutely mind blowing to me. a fine for what i a borderline war crime. wow
Specifically a fine that amounts to something like .000002% of their annual profits, and is so minuscule that it has zero deterrence effect.
But that says clearly they were able to file suit in 2007. So the statute of limitations does exist, is 10 years, they were given a 2007 start date? 
Nope, sober.  And no lobotomy, I'm actually pretty clever.  I just don't blame my country for all the world's ills.
Noam Chomsky has some great lectures about this. 

In an allegorical way it would be like having a nickname and doing blatantly illegal acts and making massive amounts of cash, while using your nickname, up until you finally get caught. 

But you also have your whole crew operating using that exact same nickname. So when you finally get caught you're like "hey, I had no personal knowledge of what went on.. I have 189 people using my nickname while conducting business. It's impossible to find who's responsible."

Then you simply pay a fine of about 2% of your profits. Then you and your 189 person crew change your nickname and carry on with illegal business as usual. Get caught.. and repeat. 
That's exactly what the "corporate veil" is there to prevent, personal liability for the corporation.

In extreme cases it breaks down, but by and large it's a good thing.  Would you risk starting a business if, when some employee was dumb enough to mix bleach and alkaline cleaners and a customer gets hurt, you could go to jail or lose your house?


Not sure why you're being downvoted. Comment is lucid and to the point
...

Sure. Why not.
Wait what are talking about?
Or Toyota accelerators.
Why do people always forget the authoritarian/non authoritarian axis of the political spectrum? Comparing maoism and stalinism to other forms of socialism is a repeatedly debunked strawman. 

Also the US killed/tortured/enslaved millions of people for the sake of capitalist progress, so dont pretend that you are on some sort of moral highground.
They didn't kill tens of millions because of socialism....
Care to elaborate?
Yeah, Pepsi is way better as a mixer. I will go out of my way to go to a bar that serves Pepsi than one that is Coke only.
I guess so. 
The companies literally supported these groups. It's not just colombians' responsibility.
You're not as clever as you think. Deep-pocketed American corporations are frequently in the wrong. They consistently choose profits over morals. Much easier to live wifh yourself when everyone else sharss some responsibility for their morally reprehensible desicions.
r/iamverysmart
Bull to that anti-establishment shit.  It's the CocaCola distributor not Coca Cola and the Paramilitary was to prevent their bottling plants from being bombed and their employees from being kidnapped.  Maybe you should go hang with the FARC and see what great guys they all are as they went 25 years through cities bombing, killing and running drugs.  Perhaps the paramilitaries abused their local power - that is what happens in third world countries when there is no central authority.  

As usual, the local suffer no matter who is in charge.
Because modern society isn't pro rape?
Because the guy stocking the vending machines at the high school probably didn't have much to do with funding a Colombian paramilitary group.
I replied to the wrong thread.
My bad
Have you not learned about Great Leap   Forward in school yet, or is that not covered until you get to High School? 
i mean if sitting down is disrespect for all of the nation then standing must mean support for all of the nation. right?
Well I will laugh my ass off when the case ends up the same way that Ecuador's suit against Chevron worked out.
Usually I'm the one doing what you just did.  But unless you claim an IQ of 150, claim to read Nietzsche,  and/or vomit a thesaurus, you don't really belong there.


That guy probably had to sell coke on the side to supplement income.
*Then he has nothing to be afraid of.*
The Great Leap Forward was destroyed by communistic ideology and lack of a solid existing economy, not socialism. They tried to quickly move a rural farm country into an industrialized country. They did this with terrible communistic ideology like collectivization of goods, forced labor,  and mass killings.

Now take a marginally successful capitalistic economy, who already has lots of socialistic programs and slowly transition it into more and more of a socialism, preferably with a fair democratic government, and your chances for success seem much greater.
Saying the great leap forward was caused by socialism is like saying that Charlie Chaplin caused the Holocaust.
Coke a cola isn't a nation, it's an incredibly large company.
Well you're certainly entitled to being an ass if it suits you lol.
What the hell's wrong with reading Nietzsche?

I'd take a Nietzsche reader over someone who responds to being called an idiot with "I'm actually pretty clever" any day.

These do not go well together.
Because a human being could consume enough to actually get drunk.

Plus its dailymail. 
It's concerning that fat is being used alongside sugar. Can we do the same thing and do "added fat" and "added sugar?" Nuts have fat but are we going to kid ourselves that almonds and walnuts aren't healthy? Or that an apple isn't healthy because it has sugar? 
Is this going to be like the Sweetums Bars in Parks and Rec? 
Hopefully the label will at least take into account a bar for glycemic index.
Good, they need to redefine the entire label. It's dated and abused.

For starters, negative items should be highlighted in red (such as sugars and sat fats), positive items should be highlighted in green (such as mono/poly fats and soluble dietary fibers) and so fourth.

The serving size should be standardized. A key trick the food industry uses to do "reduced fat" or "healthier" line of products is to muck with the serving size. For example, a "healthier" chocolate milk may advertise "50% less sugars and 50% less fat per serving!" All they did was cut the serving size in half. So that single serving container now has two servings. You'll see all sorts of these tricks on all foods items if you really read into the labels. Often, the product advertised as healthier is worse than a competing product that isn't targeting the healthier line.
I'm just going to try and not eat any sugar if I can avoid it.  God damn it's too hard. Why are there no fast food choices that have sugar free drinks or  healthy food? 
[deleted]
Whatever Corporate America wants, they will get.  

Eventually the FDA-  more or less a lobbying group for US food and drug makers now- will label Pop Tarts healthy and organic.  You'll see.   
 
any time I buy premade food that comes in a package with a bunch of words and logos on it, I assume it's unhealthy. To me, healthy means: unprepared or freshly cooked vegetables, fruit and lean meat. Anything else is kidding yourself.
"Has calories. Will make you fat if you are a lazy fuck."

There. Put that on everything.

Next problem...
FDA Continues to try and justify their existence. 
Well for starters if something is dead and sitting on a shelf somewhere it isn't *Healthy* at all. ...It's dead.

If you can eat said dead-thing and gain positive benefits from it then it is *Healthful* for you.
Anything containing animal products should be labeled with warnings in the same way as cigarettes. 
or perhaps they could at least have to say "reduced fat ^but ^^way ^^^more ^^^^sugar "
[deleted]
At this point it might be easier to call the good fats 'triglycerides' or 'lipids', and let 'fat' fall back to being the bad stuff. And the same with natural sugar being 'sucrose'.
They discuss this point in the article.

The bigger issue is that single items aren't healthy or unhealthy.  It's the diet as a whole.  A Snicker's bar or a fast food hamburger can be part of a healthy diet.

Plus I'm not sure how much these labels really change consumer habits.
> Nuts have fat but are we going to kid ourselves that almonds and walnuts aren't healthy? Or that an apple isn't healthy because it has sugar?

The real question is what does "healthy" even mean?   If you eat a pound of walnuts a day and don't change your other intake you'll likely become a fatso and have all the unhealthy side effects that go along with it.  Same if you eat bowls of blueberries every day - may as well be drinking Pepsi.  

What we should be concerned with is educating people as to *how* they should eat and couple that with labeling that lets them make decisions for themselves. 

Nuts and apples in themselves are neither healthy nor unhealthy. Same with McDonald's and Doritos. It all depends on the context of your diet and lifestyle. The sugar in Apples is 'unhealthy' if your diet is already full of sugar. 
"the child size drink is literally the size of a liquefied child, literally." 
It reminds me of the Tropicana Trop-50 orange juice. They say it has 50% of the calories an sugar as regular, but when you drink it you realize it's just watered down orange juice for more than the regular price.
> The serving size should be standardized. A key trick the food industry uses to do "reduced fat" or "healthier" line of products is to muck with the serving size. 

You could legally label a bag of pure cane sugar as "sugar free" as long as the suggested serving size is small enough. 
>The serving size should be standardized.

Serving sizes are already standardized for some items but not realistic.

This is changing by 2018. Labels must be for real servings. i.e. 1 candy bar or 1 bottle instead of 2.5 servings in a bottle.

Honestly, "bad fat" has been misrepresented and overstated.

>Conclusion: Our results do not support the association between CVDs and saturated fat, which is still contained in official dietary guidelines. **Instead, they agree with data accumulated from recent studies that link CVD risk with the high glycaemic index/load of carbohydrate-based diets.** In the absence of any scientific evidence connecting saturated fat with CVDs, these findings show that current dietary recommendations regarding CVDs should be seriously reconsidered.

The serving size thing they've cracked down on a bit better in the past decade or so haven't they?  I notice it mostly with drinks and snacks.
I agree with everything except color coding nutrition labels, that's not going to happen ever.  They are black and white for a purpose, cost.

I was under the impression we need sugar to have a balanced diet. People need to recognize that sugar is not inherently bad. It's just when you are at 110% your daily dose after just one bowl of cereal....that, yes, that *is* bad
Jack In the Box has sparkling water, Dasani I believe. I love it. That double cheese and curly fries probably isn't helping me though :/

Well, pizza is a vegetable...
Sooner or later Brawndo is gonna buy out the FDA anyways.
!Remindme 5 years.
Crap, no wonder my diet isn't working.
It's almost as if thou dost not understand the evolution of language!
Hm. Yes. Shallow and pedantic.
Found the delusional vegan.
Veganism is linked with B-12 deficiency. Maybe everything related to veganism should be labeled with warnings.
Lots of sugar is necessary to get you through your day. Its a scientifically proven fact.
And what is one ways fats go bad in the body? Pro-inflammatory compounds produced when the body is dealing with a high sugar load.
Natural sugar isn't good though. Saying that it's natural so it must be good for you allows them to sell sugar laden juices as healthy. Natural sugars are labeled as sucrose anyways which is why grape jelly can be more than 50% sugar but since it's sugar from multiple sources they're able to say the first ingredient is grapes.
Ok, but to be clear, eating bowls of blueberries is not the same as drinking Pepsi. You know that right? 

Your argument is one of moderation and frankly I disagree with this mentality. Pepsi is not healthy in moderation any more than cyanide is. Just because it won't kill you in small doses doesnt make it ok to consume. Cyanide is a dramatic example of course, but Pepsi is no more healthy. It just kills you on a much longer timescale. Blueberries don't kill you over time. You will die over time but not because you are two pounds of blueberries a day. If you eat two pounds of fried chicken a day, that will kill you. If you drink two liters of soda a day, that will kill you. Walnuts and blueberries will not. 

No one can answer your question about how healthy something is as that's a constantly shifting goalpost. In 50 years, it might be average for a person to run a marathon, so whatever diet allows you to do that or better is healthy. But today that would be a ludicrous requirement to levy on people. 

My point is, just because the concept of health is not well defined that doesn't mean we don't know it when we see it and that doesn't mean we don't know what is good and what is bad qualitatively (if our quantitative measures aren't precise). 
The health of Pepsi does not depend on your lifestyle good sir. It provides no nutrition and actively destroys your teeth and digestive system. 
A Pawnee-sized child or a normal-sized child?
It has stevia in it, along with natural flavors, so it's actually watered down with sweetened orange flavored water... in an attempt to make it not taste watered down.

I actually really like trop 50.
> You could legally label a bag of pure cane sugar as "sugar free" as long as the suggested serving size is small enough. 

Alright, time to crowdfund this. We got until 2018 to market this bad boy and laugh as people buy our sugar free sugar.
> This is changing by 2018. Labels must be for real servings. i.e. 1 candy bar or 1 bottle instead of 2.5 servings in a bottle.

This should have happened a hundred years ago.
I'm betting marketing is a bigger concern since labels are often printed in color to begin with.
... and colorblindness.
Except nutrition labels don't state what % of a daily allowance you have for sugar.  

Go ahead and look at one.  It may say 15g or sugar, but what does that mean for my daily intake?   

There's a reason why they don't put that number on there:  They don't want people to realize how fucking much they are actually consuming on a daily basis.  

Now it isn't as if there aren't hard numbers they could be using.  In fact:  

>  The FDA recommends that no more than 10 percent of your daily calories come from added sugars. That's 50 grams, or about 12.5 teaspoons, if you're on a 2,000-calorie diet. Other organizations suggest an even lower limit

So if you have that tasty Mountain Dew, you have already consumed  31g out of those 50g.    Yet why don't they say what daily % it equates too?    


> I was under the impression we need sugar to have a balanced diet.

You don't. Sugar is great if you need calories RIGHT THE FUCK NOW. Otherwise, your body will break things down into sugar, slowly enough that you don't get the spike and crash (which is your body getting fucked up). If you are in a position that straight sugar is considered a *good* thing for you, you are not a healthy person.
I just get a cup of water. 
What happened to Asians?
as long as we're being pedantic, 'well fed' doesn't necessarily mean overweight and obese. 
Fyi.. George Carlin is a comedian

Everything is a vegetable if you think hard enough!
Of course, its got what plants crave.
Found the unoriginal omni in denial.
How do you like pens?
That's only because waaaay to few vegans are smart or diligent enough to plan their diet. B-12 has to have a vegetable source somewhere. Depending on how they view yeast extract stuff like Vegemite has b-12 in it apparently. Not 100% sure if it involves an animal though. (technically though an Omni diet due to being less restrictive allows you to gain nutrition from a lot of more practical sources, which is the optimal diet)

Not a Vegetarian nor Vegan, but the "Vegan/vege lifestyle is bad for health" is a flawed argument. Veganism is about as healthy as any other diet in practice.

It's just some people are too fucktarded to control their own diets they end up in nutritional dire straits because they didn't do their homework on new diets.

Now if you mentioned iron deficiency then you'd have a slight point, but vegetables can have trace amounts of iron too.
Sarcasm, right? Please?
Excess fat = fat all over the body.

Excess sugar = fat in the liver = liver damage.

Between the two, I'd prefer to consume fat vs. sugar.


By natural, I mean unprocessed sugar that's naturally occurring in the non-sugar ingredients.  Any added sugar would be listed as such. Obviously just being natural doesn't mean it's healthy, but we add so much sugar to everything because our taste buds have been desensitized to it, and we don't realize just how sweet many foods are to begin with.
By the time it hits your digestive tract, naturally occurring sugar and HFCS break down into fructose and glucose and are practically indistinguishable.  Obviously, with blueberries you have the added benefits of fiber and roughage to increase satiety and decrease the likliehood of overconsumption but to say one is good for you and one is cyanide is plan fear mongering. 

Given a balanced diet coupled with exercise, it is *perfectly fine* to treat yourself to a Pepsi, Big Mac and large fries once in a blue moon. 

If you're an athlete, it can actually be *advantageous* to drink pure sugar water to replace depleted glycogen levels as quickly as possible.   There is no "one size fits all" and to label something a "poison" does nothing to educate.  It's perfectly fine for you to choose what foods to limit in your life, but I know I wont stop enjoying fried chicken, ribs, and pizza in moderation.

People are not stupid.  If you say "you should eat a 25/60/15 protein/carb/fat ratio, minimize processed foods, and limit certain kinds of fats", they can understand that.  Teach people how to eat, and then let them do it. 
As a subscriber to /r/loseit, the whole "no food is either unhealthy or unhealthy" has become a common sentiment among the religiously devoted CICO crowd (yes, also unfortunately CICO has "converted" a bunch of people who have taken it too far). These people do actually not seem to be able to recognize that, just because you can lose weight on a Pepsi only diet simply by remaining under your BMR, that it doesn't mean that an only Pepsi diet would be terribly unhealthy.  They seem to honestly think there would be no difference between eating, I dunno, a spinach only diet vs a Pepsi only diet, because "no food is healthy of unhealthy", and they think the only factor/benefit in this decision to eat either spinach or drink a Pepsi is the satiety one or the other provides.

You see the same thing on /r/keto. Nutters got religious about it and now there is an entire group of people who seem to honestly think a bacon only diet is perfectly healthy.
I grew up poor, so I don't mind it, but I prefer to just water down my orange juice. We always added an extra can or two of water to our frozen orange juice concentrate stuff to stretch it.
The reason it tastes like that is because it's s tripped of oxygen for long term storage but it is also stripped of flavour providing chemicals. 

When it's time to pack your juice, flavour pack is added so you really think it's orange.

It's not a juice - it's a chemical compound.

37.7% overweight/obese. But...this is a compilation of reported rates by state, and a lot of state didn't have data for Asians, so the real national numbers may be quite different. 
Their families said you are too fat and shamed them into the 30% of normalcy. 
It is, however, a diet that has only been enabled relatively recently by scientific advances. Eat a vegan diet 1000 years ago? You'd die.
No. Why do you think that people with diabettes are so active?
They get around that by using apple juice concentrate.   
As I said, it all depends on the context of your diet. Obviously an all Pepsi diet would be unhealthy. But one Pepsi a week would be completely neutral in terms of health.
Hot take.
True of veganism but 1000 years ago meat and sometimes dairy products where hard to come by. Most ate like vegetarians,  of course when meat was on the menu they ate that shit up.

I think this obesity problem is just a case of humanity not yet adjusting to how industrialization giving us a food surplus. 
I...I can't tell...
But we disagree on your last point. No amount of Pepsi is healthy. Whereas you can't conceivably eat an unhealthy amount of blueberries or almonds or spinach. You would only get there by opportunity cost of not eating other healthy things. 
I don't think it's poe.
Sure it is. If you are malnourished and starving, Pepsi could save your life. Again, it depends on the context.

>Whereas you can't conceivably eat an unhealthy amount of blueberries or almonds or spinach.  

That is ridiculous. Almonds are extremely calorie dense and contain a lot of fat. Anyone who eats almonds with no restriction would gain a lot of weight. 100 grams of almonds is nearly 600 calories.

Blueberries would be hard to overeat, but they are basically just sugar and fiber. Eat 3000 calories a day of blueberrys and you will be fat and diabetic in no time.
