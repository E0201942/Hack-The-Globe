They'll try again when the Trans Pacific partnership (TPP) agreement is signed
Suing someone without them knowing seems like a pretty pro strategy. If they don't know they're being sued, they can't defend themselves.
Australia should take Phillip Morris to court for selling a deadly drug ,that has killed millions in their country.

Maybe they can pull some shit out of their ass like "Manslaughter", or "Mass poisoning". Would love to see PM executives go to prison. 
how will they do that given that the tpp expressly forbids tobacco companies from dont have access to the isds clause within tpp

Precisely. A very misleading headline, not supported by the body text. 
> Australia should take Phillip Morris to court for selling a deadly drug

Really awkward pulling that off when PM cannot sell their product in Australia without permission of the government.
So why don't we have the same graphics of death on pop and fast foods now that we've made the solid connection between such foods and diabetes and heart failure? Why don't we? If we're going to continue the war on tobacco we can damn well start to be consistent.
Wow... talk about having courage and stepping waaaay out on a limb.

Or is that way out and **LAME.**

I watched the bit.  Didn't get it.  20 minutes of him trying to convince me cigarets are bad.  I could care less.

Philip Morris actually got a minimal amount of sympathy from me here.  Implicit in their retort are two points: 1 - that people will continue to smoke, and as long as they do, why shouldn't Phillip Morris be the company that profits from it, and 2 - Phillip Morris *is* diversifying, but they will always be tarred as the dealers of death.
This. It bothers me that it's oh so acceptable to heap piles of shit and shame on smokers. But someone wants to eat 8k calories a day and become an obese fuck and I think that's disgusting? I'm intolerant all of a sudden. 
Sounds good to me.
Not addictive as heroin
Your desire to shame fat people isn't really related to /u/octavian2's point (or the article, or the segment), and being rude to people for their personal choices is a dick move regardless of why you're doing it - as long as those choices aren't affecting you.

The two issues do differ slightly in that secondhand smoke is a thing.
> Your desire to shame fat people

Nah I don't desire to shame anyone. I'm pointing out a double standard. 
Except you're implying that "smoker-shaming" is currently socially acceptable and that fat-shaming is not, whereas I'd argue it's actually the opposite, if anything. Though there is a bit too much of both, I've definitely noticed more fat-shaming lately.

And neither should be okay.
