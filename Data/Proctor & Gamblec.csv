Didnt the 1993 geo metro get 60mpg? Doesn't the volt get 100 as it has a 50 mile battery?
My [regular gas] 2015 Micra does that right now.  For $9,998.  Don't hate me.
My 1981 Isuzu I-mark D gets 51mpg. 307xxx miles, runs like a champ. 
And only 55% more ugly
I feel like it should be double that by now
I wonder if this is a result of the new Mazda/Toyota partnership.

Part of the reason it is so ugly is simply aerodynamics.

Didn't Geo (Chevy) make cheap metros that could get 50 miles per gallon with standard car tech from over 20 years ago?

Not impressed.
>Didnt the 1993 geo metro get 60mpg?

Nope.  The EPA [rated the 1993 Geo Metro as getting 40 MPG combined.  The XFi got 47 MPG](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=9762&amp;id=9765), but it also had [a 0-60 time of 15+ seconds](http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1990/476525/geo_metro_xfi_2-door_hatchback.html).  On balance, the Prius is much [larger, faster, safer, more comfortable, and better for the environment than the Metro](http://www.tundraheadquarters.com/blog/prius-vs-geo-metro/).

I know it's popular to hate on the Prius, but I think people tend to forget the extreme sacrifices the Metros and CRX HFs of old made to achieve the economy that they did.

>Doesn't the volt get 100 as it has a 50 mile battery?

The MPGe of the Volt operating on electricity is dependent on the local electrical grid mix.  [About 40% of the US' population](http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-do-electric-cars-compare-with-gas-cars-656) live in places where the Prius would be superior to electric cars in terms of MPGe.
Well thats a pretty gay car but i cant knock that mileage. 
I feel like they should double-check the emissions.
It does feel like it should be higher at this point.  I have a 2013 and my average over the course of ownership is just under 51 and a half MPG, but I drive primarily city.


Yes but anyone over 4 feet would be unable to drive them. Those things are the closest I've seen to drivable matchbox cars.
The EPA MPG calculations were change in the years between the Geo and today.  Using the new formula the most efficient Geo (Metro XFI) would get 47MPG combined.  That says nothing about the performance differences in that Geo vs the Prius.  The Prius would feel like a top fuel dragster in comparison to the Metro XFI.
yes and the honda crx hf
So I will be clear, my hate on the Prius is that the competition is SO much better. Faster, safer, longer battery range, more technology,  better apportioned and not as ugly. This is the first real update the Prius has had in a decade. The **Volt for instance is at 50 miles of battery power where the Prius has 14** and it has the old nickel cadmium battery that doesn't last as long as the lithium. Furthermore it cuts out above 30 mpg. *You will always use gas with a Prius.*  
My issue is that the late 90's Olds Delta 98 used to get 35 mpg highway if you kept your foot out of the gas.  The '85 Delta 88 I had in college would get about 28 highway. And this is when they were old and worn out.  
They were actual cars that comfortable to drive, ride in, and safe in an accident.  They didn't lose in an accident to a Beagle.  
And they were built for people that are taller than 5'4" and heavier than 120 lbs.  
Now you have to buy an ugly crackerbox with a lawnmower engine and a huge battery to get a little more gas mileage.  And to charge it, you must plug it into electricity (that is mostly created by either burning coal or creating toxic nuclear waste).
But whatever you want to drive.  That's fine.  You can destroy the earth in different ways than i am.  I'm not giving up my truck.  And I'll buy an LTD or the like next.  And be comfortable and safe driving it.  And won't look ridiculous driving a car built for mice.
Totes gay
2007 and I get 46.6 instead of the EPA rated 46 average in basically mixed driving.
steer with your dick
The prius is far more expensive too.  My point is just that i'm baffled why there hasn't been more progress over the last couple decades.
Thanks, better example.
I had a point by point rejoinder of your post ready, but rather than engaging in an argument about which car is better, I will instead say that the Volt and the Prius are on the same side of the argument.  After all, both represent the same trend towards electrification, so in my eyes, engaging in this internet argument would be nothing more than friendly fire.

A lot of the criticisms the Prius faces (eg cost, performance, added complexity, supposed environmental impact of battery manufacturing) are equally applicable to the Volt.  As the other post demonstrates, to the detractors of hybrids and electric cars, the Volt and the Prius might as well be the same car.
> Now you have to buy an ugly crackerbox with a lawnmower engine and a huge battery to get a little more gas mileage. And to charge it, you must plug it into electricity (that is mostly created by either burning coal or creating toxic nuclear waste). 

That's not how the Prius' battery works.  99% of them don't even plug into the grid at all.  All electricity is generated onboard using either the gasoline engine or regenerative braking.  Grid-based electricity concerns are pretty much completely irrelevant to the Prius.
>The prius is far more expensive too. 

More expensive than what, the Geo?

>My point is just that i'm baffled why there hasn't been more progress over the last couple decades.

The Prius hasn't even been out 2 decades yet.  The present day Prius is a much better, larger, faster, more efficient car than the original year 2000 model.  Even then its not a fair comparison as the first few years were likely sold below cost to explore the market and develop the technology.  The Prius is now a profitable sales segment for Toyota that is working on expanding even more with 4 models of Prius now.
I disagree in that the Volt gives you the amount of battery that you *need* to justify the impact. The Prius does not. You still run gas every day, you have a battery that sucks and is woefully deficient. Why have it? The Prius is completely outdated tech, the Volt is the model that hybrids should use, enough battery to cover your day to day needs, no more, gas to take you the rest of the way. The Prius is the reason for detractors, the Volt on the other hand.... Lets just leave it at I did a J turn in one. 

upvote nonetheless
Good for them.  Thanks for the correction.
The rest of the comments still stand.
People have been making cars for over 100 years, I would have hoped we could have choices that get over 100 mpg by now.  I moved to the Philippines and there are many choices that get 50 mpg or better, you can buy a Hyundai diesel that gets 100 mpg.  

One thing that would make a huge difference would be to lower the speed limit, but I think that wouldn't fly in the US.  If people only had to go 60 mph it is vastly easier to make efficient cars and trucks.
> Why have it?

Oh thats easy:

* 2016 Chevrolet Volt MSRP **$33,170**
* 2015 Toyota Prius (2016 isn't out yet) MSRP **24,200**

The Prius is 72% the price of a Volt.  If you're not using price as a metric then I'll counter your argument with:

The Telsa Model S is a far superior car to the Volt. Why have it?


> I moved to the Philippines and there are many choices that get 50 mpg or better, you can buy a Hyundai diesel that gets 100 mpg. 

The most fuel efficient [Hyundai diesel in the Philippines](http://www.topgear.com.ph/drives/review-hyundai-accent-crdi-1-6-e-mt-sedan) I could find got 82 mpg, not 100 mpg.  Additionally, I doubt they were using the US EPA tests which would give much lower numbers so the tests themselves are apples to oranges.

Second, cars have increased in weight with the addition of mandatory safety features over the decades, yet even with this fuel efficiency is still climbing.

Lastly, it is possible to get higher mileage at the cost of more pollution.  As is in the news recently this is exactly what Volkswagen did with its diesels in the United States and is now facing charges for creating software that hid the real pollution costs.
> The *Tesla* Model S is a far superior car to the Volt. Why have it?

Debatable, highly debatable. Faster yes, many of the features are not cost efficient, environmentally efficient, or appeasing. I for one and not a fan of the giant Ipad for a center console or the asinine fold out rear facing seats. But to each his own I suppose. 
That's all true, I'm just not impressed at all with the way cars have developed as far as fuel economy.  Aside from government regs it's really consumers at fault I suppose.  The average car buyer wants to be able to tool down the highway at 80 mph with the AC blasting, not really conducive to fuel economy.
> Faster yes, many of the features are not cost efficient, 

The discussion started with cost as a metric being discarded.  It doesn't seem to make sense to reintroduce it later in the discussion.

>environmentally efficient,

Can you expand on what you mean here?  The environment you're referring to, is that globally "green" environment, or as a descriptor of the interior of the car or its operating space?  Can you give some examples of what you're referring to?
globally green. The tesla is FAR from green, better described as about as clean as stagnant sewage. Why? Those batteries are very environmentally hazardous, reflected well in the price of the battery. 300 mile range. When do you drive 300 miles in a go? How often? Its about 1% of trips, the rest of the time you (average joe) are driving 40 miles. That means that increase in environmental load of those batteries is a complete waste for ~85% of the battery. That is why I like the Volt. The engine in the Volt environmentally speaking is cheap, the battery is what you use day to day. There is no waste (was, they just upped it to 50 miles from about 40 so it is less efficient than it was last year overall, provided 100% of that increase is in the battery and not tech) in having the small E impact of the engine compared to a 260 mile battery. The engine is only used about 15% of the time so the car is far greener. 
> globally green. The tesla is FAR from green, better described as about as clean as stagnant sewage. Why? Those batteries are very environmentally hazardous, 

I reject this assertion on its face.

If you are referring to the very reactive materials that actually go into the battery, namely lithium, then the only way that lithium would be hazardous to the environment is if it finds its way into the waste stream which (with electric car batteries) just doesn't happen as a rule.  They are too valuable.  The batteries from e-cars and hybrids are recovered, recycled, and turned right back into batteries.  There is no elemental depletion that occurs within the batteries which means the core materials lithium (or nickel in older batteries) is recovered and reusable.

Telsa is working on one better.  Reusing batteries from cars without re-manufacturing.  The Telsa Powerwall product and utility grade installations are to use batteries from Telsa cars that are used beyond their peak (but still very usable) as utility grade power storage.

>reflected well in the price of the battery. 300 mile range. When do you drive 300 miles in a go? How often? Its about 1% of trips, the rest of the time you (average joe) are driving 40 miles.

Your "environmental load" argument isn't valid.  You could argue that there is waste from carrying around a heavy battery pack when it is used to capacity infrequently, but then you'd have to accept that the volt has the same problem with hauling around a full tank of gasoline that almost never gets used.  However the Telsa is powered by electricity, which can be generated by wind and solar meaning no fossil fuel impact.  The volt can't make the same claim.

>That is why I like the Volt. The engine in the Volt environmentally speaking is cheap, the battery is what you use day to day.

The engine is only used about 15% of the time so the car is far greener.

You're whole point is based around your "environmental load" argument of the Telsa which is largely invalid.  You are also ignoring the impact of fossil fuel consumption and all the environment which the Telsa doesn't have.

Those points aside, the Telsa is a far better *car*.  It comfortably seats 4 adults, and can seat 2 children at the same time.  I've sat in a Volt.  2 adults would be comfortable, but the back seats are nearly useless for adults at the same time.  So if you want to say 2 adults and 2 children for the Volt I agree.

**Lastly, I like the Volt.  I like the Telsa.  I also like the Prius.  Each of these cars represent a leap forward in pure ICE cars.  At this time all three are needed in the market to reach the different use cases that exist in the world.  No one car is superior at every use case over the others.  Each has their strengths and weaknesses.**
Parents need to take care of their kids. 

If the parents can sue Tide for making them look like 'candy' or whatever, then the government should be able to sue the parents for leaving them in a place where a child could get them. You can't just pick and choose who has responsibility..
SO here is some soap / detergent that says all over it, contact poison control if ingested. I think I'll leave it where my toddler might get into it. 


Please take their rights to reproduce away somehow
Sounds like stupid/careless parents to me. 
Why did you leave dangerous chemicals out for your infants to eat? All those parents should be charged with child neglect.
How long will it be until those "infant plaintiffs" can speak? I need to know what Tide pods taste like. They look delicious. 
And this is why we can't have nice things.  Ecigs mustn't come in flavors, pot edibles mustn't look like food, pill bottles can't be opened without two hands and a pair of pliers, and detergent can't be convenient because it's too much work for some people to monitor their kids.  It's a wonder boomers actually reached adulthood given we went through life even before there were Mr Yuck stickers.  Maybe he needs to make a comeback. 
I came home very drunk one night around Halloween and almost ate one of their Cascade dishwasher pods. They do look pretty tasty.

Hell no, sue sue, yeah they're gonna sue. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MeXQBHLIPcw
Tide pods... Darwinism in a pretty little dissolvable packet!
to be fair even I think they look tasty and I'm (legally) an adult
[deleted]
What I don't understand (maybe because I don't have kids) is why the kids eat these. I can understand when they first see them, they think they're candy & put them in their mouth, but they can't possibly taste good, why don't they just spit them out? I've seen kids let chewed up cookie fall out of the mouths, why are they eating enough of the pods to do damage?
They do look fruity and delicious, you gotta admit.
I use these

The fucking box says keep away from kids
Great - once we've punished this horrible company for making  bleach products which contain bleach, we can use that precedent to punish knife manufacturers for making knives sharp... and then I will finally be vindicated for that one time I tried to cook while drunk
Someone shoot these people.
The same thing they would have suffered after swallowing just about anything. Stupid bad parents is who should be sued.
By their reasoning a teenager maimed in a 90 mph wreck isnt at fault -- it's the Porsche.
Maybe people who let their children eat cleaning products should consider being parents more carefully
This is some of the most ridiculous crap I have ever heard, I have three kids I know they can be a handful but come on. I leave all things bad either in the locked garage or up high, above my shoulders and without anything to climb up on near it. I'll let you in on my secret i call it.... common sense.... This is like saying here honey want to iron your own shirt I have to go pee.. and they're 3.
Their throats are fried from chemicals. They're never going to speak.
i get someone needs to play devils advocate, but cmon, the parents are at fault. people need to be held accountable for their shitty life choices

[deleted]
Wow, it sounds like they don't even have to eat it to become sick. That at least makes some sense because I just couldn't imagine kids continuing to eat these things once they taste them.
What percentage off fault would you place on the parties? The parents share the larger burden here for failing to secure their cleaning products from their infant children. Other laundry soap doesn't come in child proof containers so I don't really agree that P&G acted in bad faith with the release and packaging of the product.      
My parents kept all cleaning products in a locked cabinet or above the washer and dryer well out of reach of any young child or animal. Zero problems.
[deleted]
The product is more toxic because it is designed as a highly concentrated form of the detergent without any dilution (yes what comes in bottles is diluted). Furthermore, it reacts extremely quickly with water to become active. You can't just make it "safer" that's not how chemicals work.

Parents need to take some fucking responsibilities for chemical safety in their homes. Yes it has fun, colorful packaging but so do many more dangerous chemicals such as some bleach containers or rat poison.
[deleted]
No, the point in making is that far more deadly chemicals also have colorful packaging. Parents need to take some responsibility for keeping harmful chemicals out of the hands of their children. Stop nannying people and start talking children away from parents that can't follow rule one of parenting: protect your child. 
**Im so tired of these titles: commenter.**


She was fired for taking home product samples. Which the employer im assuming "unofficially" suggests to do so the employee can gain true consumer experience with the product. But the employee claimed it is not against company policy to do this. But they still fired her for it all of a sudden just after she got pregnant. What a coincidence! And in the past being told "being pregnant isn't being in uniform with being a sales person in the past (before she got pregnant) is the icing on the cake that ensures her right to win.

For the people that didn't read the article. It's obvious this company had a culture of "pretty and skinny sales women" only. Get pregnant and we get rid of you policy. And she was warned about this in the past. And guess what, she got  prego, and all of a sudden she violated some random employer policy that may or may not exist. 

In this case it's debateable, the company suggests using test products to gain "product knowledge". But at the same time "stealing is against company policy" so basically they have set up a corporate culture to be able to fire anyone easily without giving person fired unemployment, or wrongful termination rights. And it took someone being pregnant to expose it..

Edit: multiple spell check issues. And I hope she wins. I hate how companies treat employees. Usually the company writes it's "employment policies" to get away with wrongful termination. Just like this one did, But when you do this to a pregnant woman. Expect bad press.
I don't understand your objection to the title.  Just because a company likely lied doesn't mean the editor who wrote the title needs to repeat that lie.

Both sides are super guilty of this, Reddit despises anything to do with any Republican (until they die, then they get like a 3 week pass), and the Right has been doing this for a long time. Whoever's not in power rouses their base to hate the other side and so it swings back and forth.
My parents are becoming the very thing they taught me not to be. 

My mom used to say, "I don't care who started it, be the bigger man and finish it by walking away." Now she proudly proclaims, "I'm a fighter like Trump. You mess with me I'll fight back."

They have a MAGA hat in the house hanging proudly.
It's just you. The rest of us remember that it has always been this way.
Kids just taking their game of "casino" way to seriously. 
Now that we all have global TV stations in our pockets the can of worms is wide open.
No, not really. Its about the same as it's always been. The difference is now with mass media and 24-hour news we actually know they're doing it.
No, it's just getting harder and harder for bad actors to slink away.
That's very true. I don't understand how grown men can behave like this. Teenagers, yes - it's still wrong, but I understand. Adults, though?! They should know better, especially if they're a goddamn senator. 
Trump ran on a platform of petulant incivility and won. Against a dozen viable candidates.
Trump lowered the bar significantly. Everyone saw that you could get away with it and *literally be elected President* so here we are.
the common denominator is they are politicians 
Him and the jackass congressman in California who said we should nuke firearms owners. 
I wonder when people will say the same about Keith Ellison.  Even Kareem Hunt is wondering when Keith is actually going to feel consequences.  
Being a democrat has 100% to do it. He’s in your party, he was voted in by your party, he represents you. 
For what? I mean tweet, get your head out of your ass. These are adults, they can have mean conversations. 

I don't see how this adds up to anything quite honestly.
i’m not gonna be at all upset if this guy is forced out, but imma be totally honest:

i do wish politicians told each other to kill themselves a little more often
His constituents voted for him.

They get exactly what they deserve.
H*ll yeah, man.
[removed]
You’re allowed to swear on the internet. Also stop being such a pearl clutching church lady.
i think more politicians should tell each other to kill themselves.
On the scale of modern politics this is nothing. It’s amazing how Democrats will climb over each other to attack their own. This is a fucking state senator and it has this many comments and upvotes. This wouldn’t even be considered a news story of it were a Republican.
Dude's really gonna lose it when he's demoted to Iron IV
politicians and cops are exempt from his proposed bill. 
What's funny, he's the guy that proposed the social media and search engine history searches be added to the checks for firearms permit renewal.
Sadly he sounds perfect for a government position in today’s society 
Sources say the senator also advised the other party to "get rekt" before sarcastically commenting "gg" after losing 7-0.
Wow!

Wow!

Wow!
Whats interesting about it?  
Im confused by your comment (not the quote).

Can you elaborate on how the 2 phrases are different? Sure, one is more shocking than the other, but it's the same damn thing. This dude is scum, regardless of which side of the aisle he is on.
I for real thought they meant GOP foe as in like, a foe of the GOP, implying the senator in question was at the very least pro-GOP.
It's just one mean Twitter conversation with some nobody, I don't see why it should have any real impact.

Telling someone to go walk off a pier or bridge or Cliff is fairly normal use of dialogue in America and saying someone should just go kill themselves is also fairly normal use of dialogue in America. We've just gotten rid of the analogy part and made it more blunt, the statement is still the same and it's not to be taken entirely literal.

Hopefully you can still tell somebody to take a long walk off a short pier and not like get charged with assisted suicide.

It's funny we have the conservatives in here attacking freedom of speech today. 

The difference here is that it's not a call to arms or violence or even a call for mass suicide on a public scale, it's just two people having an angry discussion. So..... I don't see where it really matters. telling someone they should go kill themselves it's just a figure of speech, it's not a threat and it's rarely a literal statement.

I would only be concerned about this if the person he was talking to had history of suicide because then he is going a little bit too far. in this scenario he's effectively just saying take a long walk off a short pier except he's not doing it quite with his many words.

Maybe part of the problem is the decline of reading comprehension among the general population due to their obsession with extremely short and semi meaning posts and comments. A platform like Twitter is a good example of how arbitrarily limiting the amount of characters in order to get quick and viral statements can also wind up being a poor method of informing the public or continued adult education.

Short and sweet is great for marketing, but it's not so good for much else.

Eh, it looks to me like you guys were getting upset about one silly Twitter comment where he basically told her to take a long walk off a short pier in modern terminology.

I don't see a problem with the Twitter comment. I don't know the guy beyond that.

I don't see that as a violent statement. It might be a little bit unprofessional, but politically that's the times we live in. 

It's not that I have a problem with you challenging him with another democratic candidate, it's that I don't find his comment bad enough to demonize him.
He needs to resign because he said a mean thing on twitter? Is that where society is at now?
What would happen if he wasn't those things? We had a white republican bodyslam a journalist recently, and nothing happened to him. 
Or he could be a White, Republican, US Congressman from Montana who physically assaulted a journalist.

What happened to him exactly?

How about we stop with labels other than calling out assholes?
I think you mean rich, and a politician 
Nothing will happen because this is a nothing issue. 
Yep. It's important that Democrats not tolerate their leaders behaving like this.

He already got demoted for an assault on a cameraman. He had a second chance and blew it. 
Really?  So a polite Republican that defunds social programs is more palatable to you than a Democrat who curses like a sailor and insults everyone who would defund social programs, but is pro- science, pro-regulation and clean water, etc. 

Are you so meek you can’t handle it when we play like they do?  Maybe you should sit this one out and let the adults deal with it then. 
I'd rather a literal pile of dog shit over any Republican.
Fuck "civility."
They already have. No one cares
> If you can't say it on Reddit

But you *can* say this on reddit.

You can say far worse on reddit than what he said. 
I'm definitely allowed to tell people to go kill themselves on Reddit. that has long been a figure of speech and form of communication among humans and it's not a threat.

it's the same as telling someone to take a long walk off a short pier and if social platforms think they can regulate that, they will find themselves mistaken.
You are literally commenting on a story in the media about it...
Greg Gianforte attacked a reporter and won his election, and we're supposed to throw our guy out because Republican's cry about what a Democrat said on Twitter, without a hint of irony.

Fuck that, he may be an asshole, but he's not a Republican, and that's all that matters.
Your victim mentality is so intense.
Yeah, he should body slam reporters like patriotic Americans! /s
Why is this being downvoted? Happens every time, Republicans scream and Democrats trip over themselves to claim how much they hate him/her. This is a state senator and receiving this kind of attention. If this were a Republican, it wouldn’t be a news story. 


 
A state senator negates that? 
I wouldn't count on it, this is the same guy who assaulted a meter maid back in 2005 because he was doubleparked after an accident. If that didn't sink him, I don't think this tweet will.
This is more like a pre-req for modern politicians. Offers them the apology interview, where they get to sell themselves as a better person... than themselves.
> I saw this today. He should resign.

> Not okay. There's probably plenty of evidence that their policies are wrong. Use the facts against them.

> What a fool. He better resign soon.

> He apparently has a history of assault as well.

> Hope he resigns.

> Not acceptable. We are better than that.

> Wtf dude.. way to represent your office and title. This dumbass should resign.

> Well, that guy can go to hell.

> What a jackass. Time for his dumb ass to go.

> Aaand your political career is over.

Right, not like they'd condemn him for telling someone to kill themselves.

Yeah, it's just on the left @@
Yes unlike right's love of Greg Gianforte body slamming a reporter and receiving a presidential endorsement, winning an election, and being promoted in Congress.

But no one would argue with him again for fear that he is a warlock
California state Senator Leeland Yi (or Yee) was caught in the act of directly helping organized crime elements from China smuggle in machine guns and RPGs (the munitions and launchers) to the US.   
  
He received 5 years house arrest for "good public service" after the weapons smuggling charges were dropped.
Except for politicians, their armed security details and cops...of course...
Elected officials essentially get "park anywhere you want" passes in NYC. It's gotten really bad under De Blasio.

\* Except for the president and justices
he first more than one special interest group....  
He was arrested. A good lawyer can usually get a small charge like that dropped, and you don’t need to be a senator for that to happen.
It happened in 2005 though. I think if there were legal repercussions they would have happened by now.

considering that the people of his district elected him well after this supposed 2005 event oh, I don't really see how it's even relevant other than perhaps you can make fun of him for having a short temper.
Totally irrelevant to the article - quit race-baiting. 
You could basically say that about 99.9% of retail customers.  People are assholes
Yeah but that's a stereotype people have joked about for years. Politicians attacking people is relatively new. 
There's a decreased number, but the ones that are made can be pretty damn intriguing. 
It's baffling how we ever had any sort of decent justice system before video evidence. "He said she said" has been the standard for a long long time.

This recent article seems appropriate here:

[The Atlantic - The Real Roots of American Rage](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/charles-duhigg-american-anger/576424/)
> The untold story of how anger became the dominant emotion in our politics and personal lives—and what we can do about it.

The article is interesting because it covers how anger is a more useful emotion than we give it credit for, but also how it can become toxic and all-consuming if anger becomes constant and doesn't result in any form of catharsis.

The rise of 24/7 "infotainment" sources like Fox News and later on the internet, has meant that much of the public is trapped in a cycle of constant anger and outrage.

The author also goes into how this ultimately leads to societal breakdown and violence, and reaches an uncomfortable conclusion that I've myself felt to intuitively true:  That we're much closer to the precipice of widespread violence than we may think.
> My mom used to say, "I don't care who started it, be the bigger man and finish it by walking away." 

Thats not exactly amazing advice for all situations, though....
And after he won, he still acted like a sore loser, kept going with insults and petulant immaturity.

Reddit supports that idea tho
That's not what he said.  
Feel consequences for what?
>he represents you.

Does that mean the right's official stance on vaccinations is that they do cause autism?

Because it's definitely Trump's stance. And he is the leader of the Republican party.
Shit man, I'd be ashamed to bring that up if my own representative is Trump.
https://ballotpedia.org/Kevin_Parker_(New_York)#Elections

To be fair, doesn't seem like they had too many options. More people need to run.
No. but if they know this and still vote him back in hellll to the yes
That's not how voting works because human beings generally understand how to lie and misrepresent themselves. I call it marketing!

He also might be a good senator for his area, just not one with a perfect record. We'd have to like ask the locals to know more I think. 
Fuck you I didn't vote for Trump and technically, I'm a constituant. 
You're getting voted down but this is true.  They love this shit.  This guy made the wrong move but I can't say I am surprised.
Not allowed to swear on the internet in New York.
Cops I can understand but politicians? The fuck?
Nice pass!
Not OP but I think he is saying that calling it "casually tweeting" is the interesting phrasing.
Typically would anyone punching a traffic cop be considered colorful?
> It's just one mean Twitter conversation with some nobody, I don't see why it should have any real impact.

Absolutely not. This was a comment from a constituent about him breaking rules of his position.

This acceptance of shit behavior is why we have a man child in the oval office now.

Public decorum from politicians should be required.
That... doesn't make it appropriate.  As a senator, you're generally expected to lead by example, and telling someone you disagree with to kill themselves is a shit example no matter what side you are on.

It's not a violation of his free speech to say that what he said was in very poor taste for anyone, nonetheless a senator.  It's not a violation of his free speech to say he should quit until he can get his shit in order and find a less hateful way to engage people he disagrees with.  It'd be a violation of his free speech if he was given a fine for saying it.

We can do better as a country on both sides, but not when our leaders stoop to childish insults like telling your opponents to go kill themselves.  It just normalizes that behavior and yeah, maybe he doesn't really mean it but there are plenty of people that will see a sitting US Senator say it, think it's okay, and really mean it.  

No, let's not stoop down to the childish behavior of Republicans. This isn't acceptable in the Democratic Party and he already got demoted for breaking someone's camera and finger. He had his chance, can him. 
Why not both?
> "Nor was that the first time Mr. Parker had found himself in the headlines: In 2005, Mr. Parker had been arrested and charged with punching a traffic agent when he noticed the agent was writing a summons for the senator’s double-parked car. The charges were eventually dismissed."

Yeah, he needs to go.
Hey mate, your partisanship is showing.
He needs to resign because he apparently can't be trusted to act like an adult in public.  Not "because he said a mean thing."  

What's scarier is that this guy has a prior history of assault: twice, both with apparently little to no repercussions.  This guy is a menace, and absolutely deserves to get kicked out of office.
Parker already assaulted a journalist and got away with just a misdemeanor (down from a felony)

>The Senate Democrats expressed an unwillingness to expel Parker

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker_(New_York_politician)#Controversy

>On May 8, 2009, Parker was charged with felony criminal mischief for attacking a New York Post photographer and damaging the photographer's camera and car door. According to prosecutors, the photographer's finger was broken in the alleged attack.[3] Parker was charged with a felony due to the value of damage to the camera and car door.[4] As a result, he was stripped of his leadership position as majority whip and chair of the Energy Committee.[5] Parker was convicted of a misdemeanor charge, criminal mischief, and on March 21, 2011 was sentenced to three years probation and a $1,000 fine.
I wish more people were bothered by politicians getting away with criminal activity rather than just being worried about their political opponents behavior.

Democrat is a perk above rich and politician and being black is a perk among democrats. 

So he's 2 levels above rich and a politician. 
To be fair, you have to have a high IQ to understand the nuances of civil discussion.
Sorry but got to downvote you on this. We should not tolerate telling someone to kill themselves. Here's an idea: why not replace Bigmouth with another D who can fund social programs without scaring the "children"?

Who have every right to fear a further slide of standards.
the guy is a giant piece of shit with anger issues and violent tendencies but hey stick your head in the dirt. If he wasn't a politician he'd be in prison on multiple felonies.
Democrats expect more from their leaders. Despite the delusional bullshit you hear from conservative news sources, their personal standards are vastly higher and they expect their members to follow it. 

If Trump was a Democrat he would have been kicked out years before he even had the chance to run for President. Hes a reject by Democratic standards. 
> So a polite Republican that defunds social programs [is worse]?

Have an upvote for your rational comment in the sea of artificial downvotes.
Username definitely checks out!
He will survive tho that is my point in case you didn't catch on. There will be no hashtags, no investigations, no mobs showing up at his house, he wasn't asked to step down. He said it on Twitter, media can't hide it since it was public, they bury the news and move on. Call it damage control. The media's reactions are not fair or equal. 
Whataboutism?

Oh, partisans. LOL, such dumbfuckery
Gianforte was prosecuted so that kind of devalues your argument.
I'm not a victim. I find it funny as hell. Nice strawman though
Because nothing proves you have personal standards like a raging childish incoherent rant.

Don't forget, he was a champion for Gun Control to keep civilian guns out of criminal hands, while supplying criminals with military weapons. 
Not correct. 5 years, yes, but in a federal prison, and the racketeering charges include weapon smuggling. 
You mean the Nobles, their retinue and the Knights.

You mean you don’t think he served his sentence by doing 13 months in a private wing of the jail with 12 hour work release to his own personal office six days a week?

It’s completely relevant if you’re a “random” black man. But only your perspective matters, sorry about that.

Retail workers are partly to blame. I'm very reasonable and empathetic to them. I compromise what should be standard in retail relationships constantly, but I can't go a single day without a retail worker somewhere being a dick or acting like I'm inconveniencing them. Try asking someone who works at Walmart politely where an item is. There are a lot of customers out there that are dicks but a lot of us are reasonably pleasant people. We are just getting sick and fed up of being treated like shit from people we are trying to give our money to.

Which countries is this increased anger occurring in? Are there not 24/7 news cycles in other countries?
This is a news story about a democrat, so of course you guys have to make this about MAGA and fox news, right?
Except not really? 


It is a mixture of the truth. This dude wasn’t advocating to nuke gun owners, anyone who isn’t an idiot and read the original tweets would agree. Someone threatened him and he replied, was it professional? No. Is here literally out there advocating for nuclear weapons to be used? Not really that would be a very disingenuous way of presenting what he said 
I know an abortionist who keeps an arsenal due to the threats on his life. One in particular contained a picture of his kids with the message, "Your children don't deserve to live when you denied God's gift of life to others." He tried to use that as evidence to get a CCW, but the LA County Sheriffs denied it because he failed to state a "good cause."
Ya, because they totally didn't repeatedly bomb and shoot up clinics. Including Bill Oreilly getting a doctor murdered. 


Didn't conservatives bomb abortion clinics and murder the doctors who performed the abortions?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence

> A shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, **left three dead and several injured**, and a suspect Robert L. Dear was apprehended.[I 25][I 26][I 27] The suspect had previously acted against other clinics, and referred to himself as a "warrior for the babies" at his hearing.[I 28][I 29] Neighbors and former neighbors described the suspect as "reclusive",[I 26] and police from several states where the suspect resided described a history of run-ins dating from at least 1997.[I 27] As of December 2015, the trial of the suspect was open;[I 28] but, on May 11, 2016, the court declared the suspect incompetent to stand trial after a mental evaluation was completed.[I 30]

But lets look into this:


>Pressed by moderators on the nature of the punishment, Nonini nodded in agreement when asked if he supported the death penalty as a possible outcome for abortion.

>Nonini, **a three term state senator** from Coeur d’Alene, confirmed that position in a phone interview with The Associated Press.

How about bills pushed by the right that allowed you to murder someone for attempting to have an abortion? Would that work for you?

>A law under consideration in South Dakota would expand the definition of “justifiable homicide” to include killings that are intended to prevent harm to a fetus—a move that could make it legal to kill doctors who perform abortions. The Republican-backed legislation, House Bill 1171, has passed out of committee on a nine-to-three party-line vote, and is expected to face a floor vote in the state’s GOP-dominated House of Representatives soon.

https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/nebraska-justifiable-homicide-abortion-bill/


But we'll just ignore this because "Those crazy right-wingers, amirite?"
The difference is conservatives have a reputation for literally bombing abortion clinics and doctors and Democrats do not actually have access to nuclear weapons or a reputation of bombing Republicans with nuclear weapons.

One would clearly be a joke and the other would be firing up mentally unstable fundamentalists and essentially asking them to ramp up their efforts on bombing abortion clinics again.

The idea you think those two items are somehow of equal value is probably going to be the funniest thing I read all day.
Not equivalent. It would be like a Republican of equal status telling Democrats to go kill themselves. And that isn’t too difficult to picture if one hasn’t already.

96.9 percent of the fucking vote.
I live in an adjacent NY State Senate District (Parker is SD21, I live in SD20). We just booted the SD20 incumbent but it took an incredible amount of work. 

The political machine, any political machine, is all about protecting their power via their incumbents, even when they go off the rails. Our incumbent only lost because he joined a group of Dem State Senators who caucused with the Republicans, handing them control of the state senate in return for "Lulus", more money, staff, committee positions, and larger offices. This created a deadlocked legislature, as the lower house was more solidly Dem. Even with that questionable behavior, the state democratic party was initially pretty uninterested in giving him the heave-ho.

The work it took to boot that guy was huge. We had to gather thousands of petition signatures to get our challenger on the primary ballot, while the incumbent had the party machine to produce his petition. We then had to raise a few hundred thousand dollars in small donations to run the campaign, while the incumbent got the great majority of his campaign funds from the Real Estate industry, washed through the Independence Party.

Only when it became evident that we had a good chance of defeating the incumbent did the bulk of other elected Democrats start endorsing our guy (Notable exception: Thank you, early ally Assemblywoman Diana Richardson.) Even so, our challenger only prevailed in the primary by 8%, probably aided by huge turnout driven by larger state and national issues.

The Democratic incumbent, having been defeated for this year's Democratic nomination, ran in the general election as the Independence Party candidate. Our candidate, now with the magic (D) next to his name, proceeded to get >92% of the vote.

You need (at least) two competitive political parties in a democracy if you want leaders to be accountable to their constituents. Without that, the dominant party picks then preserves the officials, no matter what they do.
This shit bothers me so much. It's like the only choice we have a lot of the time is between a Democrat we aren't a big fan of, or some idiot GOP guy that will vote in lockstep with the far-right and believes the Earth is thousands of years old. The GOP doesn't put a serious candidate in the running because it's pointless for them to try to appeal to a liberal voter base (and because none of their candidates are reasonable, they are all identical and vote on orders of the party) but the Democrats see no reason to replace their candidate with someone else because it's a guaranteed and consistent win. It's fucked. The GOP may be awful but improving the Democratic party is also a major uphill battle.
96.9% of his constituents voted for him.

I'd say he represents his district perfectly.
WTF does Trump have to do with this shithead?

96.9% of this district voted for Parker.
I have no idea what that is supposed to mean but please stay mad
"Rules for thee not for me" ~ American political elite.
Politicians almost always exempt themselves from laws they make. Happens with tax laws, happened with the ACA, and sometimes happens with possession laws.
We don't deserve the same rights as our rulers they believe. 
Because it's not about public safety. It's about them keeping themselves safe from the public. 
I'll demand he quit right after Trump does.
Saying an inappropriate thing in a twitter argument and then apologizing. isn't exactly the same thing as not being able to act like an adult in public.  Yeah, he was wrong.  He did the dumb thing. No, I don't care that much.
And he was punished and stripped of his leadership position, not promoted like the Republican was.

So literally the exact opposite.

You just proved the liberals point for them.

Uh as far as I can tell the only representatives who seem to be resigning due to public scandal are democrats. Republicans seem pretty resilient to shame. 
Hes talking about a hypothetical but you neglect to even address his original point. Instead you created a new argument and the  told him he held the wrong position based on your new argument which he has expressed no opinion on.
Not his argument
He was a Democrat btw
Louis Farrakhan?
Democrats dont have higher standards, what are you smoking? And he is a Democrat.
I have told this to relatives who have held office and in both parties.

You are all full of shit! 

I am betting many people feel that way at this point.

Repub,Demos,Rhinos,Dinos. It doesnt matter. They are all spouting horse hockey.
After he was elected by Republicans.

I'll happily look the other way with what a Democrat rep does so long as the other side does it for theirs. Anything less, and we're shooting ourselves in the foot for no benefit.

Because he cant admit to himself that hes biased and this isnt anywhere near as important as the crimes Republicans commit. 
Wow you are and in 1 year too. I am amazed I have what I have after 6 times that. 
And while in jail he still got 300,000 votes for state secretary. 
You mean "civilian hands."
Garbage in garbage out, it's a culture problem
I enjoyed this comment more than I thought I would. I will start referring this to everything governmental.
fucking underrated comment
I'm oddly fine with tearing down the current government and replacing it...with...

Nothing.
Trump is bringing back droit du seigneur!  Make America Medieval Again
I bet they’d get in trouble if they shot each other 
I listened to a podcast "Serial" that covered a court case in Ohio about something like this: 

A woman in a bar had her ass slapped by a guy. She ignored it, then he did it a few more times in a row. Finally, she decides to leave, but he pulls her back by her arm. She struggles against him, and another woman (friends with the guy) thinks ...well, whatever she thinks, the 2nd woman starts fighting the first woman and throws some punches. This is all caught on camera. 

1st woman is defending herself when a cop with a bodycam steps out of the bathroom, sees the struggle and intervenes. While the 1st woman is on the floor flailing against the 2nd woman, the cop pulls the 2nd woman off but also gets struck by the 1st woman's arm flailing around. 

The cop then arrests the 1st woman for assaulting an officer, but he explains to her that he is NOT pressing charges, he understands she was flailing, and they need to get all the camera evidence to get the full story. 

The town prosecutor decides to press charges against the cop's advice. There are no charges pressed against the man or the 2nd woman, even though the bar camera clearly shows it's self defense, and the 2 are instigators. Only the woman who was slapped and then punched was charged with anything, and assaulting a cop is a felony. 

The 2 instigators are regulars at the bar, so 4 witnesses help them by lying about them being instigators, and saying "the man would never slap anyone's ass" even though there's video evidence of it. 

The 1st woman can't afford legal help, and then she loses her job because her boss doesn't like that she hit a cop and is on trial. 

Bullshit all the way down. 
I don't think "traffic agents" are cops. It's the modern term for meter maid is it not? Just a person that putzes around writing parking tickets.
Good point. 
i think more politicians should punch cops
To be pedantic, police are not military and are considered to be 'civilians', also. 

Apparently no "random" black man has ever attacked a cop and lived to tell the tale.
Ha! Perfect!
You aren't wrong.  I try to be as nice to people as I can.  I service commercial landscapers, and I just get tired of people getting upset that I won't give them 20% off everything they want.  I guess I don't work in retail in the traditional sense (like Walmart) but some people are just jerks.  I don't go looking for an argument, but If someone is being rude to me, I have zero problem telling them to go suck an egg. 

That being said, I hear you on the "why are you being such a jerk, I'm just trying to give you money".   It's uncalled for.  


I never have an issue, maybe it’s you. 
They used to have cane fights 
I never said Democrats were immune.  Sadly, I would say the left seems to be heading down much the same path.
Exactly, it's not like conservatives have ever inserted HillaryHate into unrelated crap, right? 
> This dude wasn’t advocating to nuke gun owners, anyone who isn’t an idiot and read the original tweets would agree.

"How are you gonna fight the government when the government has nukes" is a pretty weird thing to say, if the implication wasn't that the government would use the ultimate sanction on someone.
He lives in California, what makes him think he is allowed to use deadly force to defend himself?
https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/415595-gop-state-lawmaker-who-published-manifesto-calling-for-war-against-enemies

Sure, if it were a republican, it would get him re-election.
Im not sure how you could possibly read that from his tweet. Seemed more like he was mocking all the wannabe Rambo morons with fantasies of taking on the government. 
Would you then also agree that Trump advocated for the murder of Hillary's judicial appointments if she got elected, [as evidenced here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47wR-VvB0Tg). 

> If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although, the second amendment people, maybe there is...

"If Hillary gets a Supreme court pick, you might want to shoot them".

>The divorce records, unsealed Wednesday, don’t contain any information that indicts the congressman, as some of his political opponents seemed to be hoping they would. **Instead, they reveal evidence of a difficult marriage unsettled by medical issues, and one in which Keith Ellison was himself subjected to frequent physical attacks**. “It was very humiliating to admit that I was a domestic abuse victim,” he wrote in a 2015 court affidavit.

i mean that particular thing wasn’t even actual whataboutism though, it was an analogy with the purpose of arguing against a line of thought
With about 40% turnout. Worth thinking about how many people chose not to vote, given the lack of viable competition.

Also, criticism of candidates usually comes from competitors; without competition, voters won't be adequately informed.
Against the Republican, yeah.... T
He should be primaried though.
The earth is hundreds of years old! Literally hundreds!
>or some idiot GOP guy

You are part of the problem.  His opponent was from the conservative party not the Republican party. 
> believes the Earth is thousands of years old.

6000, usually.

It's obviously 2018 years old, though.
The Earth is thousands of years old, though. Unless you're a Last Thursdayist.
No primary opponent, and the Conservative Party has never been much more than a [minor third party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_the_Conservative_Party_of_New_York_State) with some [local positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_New_York_State#Current_elected_officials).
Would you say they got exactly what they deserved?
Yeah, I think you forgot about people who chose not to vote.
All law-makers should be required to abide by the laws they pass without exception. They should not receive any benefits not given to the common people. That is the ONLY fair way.
All gun laws should apply to police. Policemen are civilians too, and as such should not be exempt from the laws they enforce. 
This is why boating laws concerning alcohol have traditionally been so lax.  

Even today, open containers are still totally okay on boats, but not in cars.  
Some of us would prefer they all quit.
... he "apologized" and then posted a follow-up attack against the same person not an hour later.  That doesn't even remotely qualify as an apology to any reasonable person.  

Nice of you to wave off his charges of criminal assault, just like the police did for him apparently.  What does he need to do for you to actually care, kill someone?
What Republican got a promotion for assaulting a journalist?

Being elected is not a promotion.

I mean, I care about both but fuck me right?

Not really. Bozeman, where he lives, is extremely liberal. He was voted in because people know that he gets things done. Yeah, he's a dick but an effective one that everyone benefits from.

That said, he hasn't done squat since he got in office.
Why? Because they aren't even remotely similar levels of behavior, that's what makes it biased. 


Mainly because he mostly posts in popular circlejerk subs.
Yeah.  Politics, right?  I live in Duncan Hunter's district.  If voters don't hold these people accountable, what should we expect, really?
The goal is ultimately to make everyone a criminal.
[deleted]
I'm not, no government means no laws. Which means murder, rape, slavery, 
and pedophilia are no longer illegal. Besides the instant we say "yay! no more government" some asshole says "I got guns and cash, I'm king now" and taada! We have a government again.
You’d be dead within a few days... governments hold together modern civilizations. Without governments and laws people would just do whatever the fuck they wanted.
True anarchy won't work. For an example, just take a look at /r/Anarchy. Ever noticed how they have a moderator (AKA, someone who runs the place)? The irony is strong with this one.
Fucking moron it's been this way before Trump. Accept that you let this happen and stop blaming the orange idiot.
Too be fair, he's pretty much a reincarnation of King George.

As in demented and sorely in need of a regency?
Depends, is your target a black cop? Did he "rat" on you and your buddies? Free ride!
or if a cop got drunk and ran over a pregnant woman thus killing her
good episode of serial!
If you assualted one, they would still be a government official though, right? And that can carry a much harsher sentence 
SUPPOSED to be considered Civilians. But in the real world that is hardly the case unfortunately  
[deleted]
No, it just acknowledges the ridiculousness of this tea party fantasy that the people are going to one day stick to the god damn gubmemt “WHEN (apparently)” it becomes tyrannical despite the fact that behind said government would be the most powerful military in the world. Besides, as long as it remains fairly populist I’m not worried about the current government, I’m worried about armed regimes, coops, and violent political parties taking power and actually making a tyranny. 
California actually follows the castle doctrine, and [state common law recognizes stand your ground](https://www.kqed.org/news/104272/5-things-to-know-about-stand-your-ground-in-california). As long as he's not the initial aggressor in a confrontation, he can use deadly force in response to an imminent threat to his life or that of his family.
Ha. Not surprised at all. Nor am I surprised that I am being downvoted for accuracy as I always am in “News” and I’m sure you will be too. “Shame on you for posting facts!”

WTF is wrong w this place??
We should aspire to be better than Trump, not just on par with him.
Did you even read your own link?  Those are two different people.  Monahan was never married to him.

The amount of people who have used the divorce records to discredit Monahan is astounding.

They literally have nothing to do with her or her son’s claims.
So the woman and her son are liars.  Believe women until they accuse a democrat right?

Not even 5% of the district could vote for a write-in candidate that isn't a complete pile of shit?

I'm not asking for a large portion of his constituents to be sane.  Just 5-6%.  They couldn't even manage that much.

That's a shit district filled with shit people.  And they get what they deserve.
People too lazy to vote don't matter.

96% of the people who got off their asses to vote chose Parker.
Isn't there a Constitutional Amendment requiring exactly this?
Yeah he was a dumbass, I totally agree. But people acting like this was some mortal sin are just being silly. Fortunately the NY GOP leader had an appropriate response asking that he be reprimanded.  That's appropriate. But this isn't some big national scandal. It's someone saying a dumb thing in a twitter argument.  I know Americans love their drama but come on. Stop being such a delicate flower.
Are you fucking dense or just being intentionally obtuse?

He was **charged with a felony** which was later dropped to a misdemeanor. He was **sentenced to three years probation** and a $1000 fine. He **was** punished.
This comment makes no sense in reply to what he said.
The dad of the famous killer brothers got off light.
We should dump some tea 
I thought the swamp would be drained by now?
I never understand why people think that no government means no one will fuck with them ever again. All that means is each region will have a warlord and will constantly be fighting others for the title. 
You can't be king unless some lady in a pond gives you Excalibur...
It’ll be like the paleo diet, but for politics
On the other side of that coin having governments has increased our capacity for violence far beyond anything that an anarchist society would be ever capable of. I am in no way advocating anarchism, but having a government is very much an extreme on both ends of society.
I think a lot of people misunderstand what anarchy means.
She was comin' right for us!
I would assume so.
It tends to be, when the guy with the cane attacks the unarmed guy from behind.
The US government is a violent armed regime. 
Regardless of what this congressman suggested, most of the weapons (like nukes) they have are useless against a civilian guerrilla style rebellion. Unless they intend to just kill everyone.
But he’s not allowed to have the means of defending himself on him. So he’s only allowed to defend himself at home, and only with a government approved weapon. 
All the righties are desperate for literally anything they can grasp on to.  Feel bad for thim. This is what they're reduced to.  "A democrat said an inappropriate thing in a twitter argument! We got em!"  So they're going to be smugging all over this.
The divorce literally isn’t even hers.  She was never married to him, yet his defenders keep using it as proof she’s lying.  

Divorce documents regarding his marriage to another woman are somehow proof he’s innocent of his ex girlfriend’s accusations.

Below your comments he tells you to keep reaching. 

Maybe he should tell himself that.
Where did I say they are liars? Pretty desperate strawman, my dude. 
"Believe women" means we don't dismiss a woman's account out of hand, which is a common response. Monahan was not dismissed. She has been given ample opportunity to tell her story and share the video that shows Ellison abusing her. She has chosen not to share this evidence, or claimed it was lost, depending on when she was asked. 
Running for public office, no matter how bleak the odds, shouldn’t ever be considered a waste of time.
> Not even 5% of the district could vote for a write-in candidate that isn't a complete pile of shit?

A write-in candidate still requires someone running. You expect people to vote and put in random people they know won't win, rather than just not voting? Or are you forgetting about everyone who didn't vote?

Only about 97K voters voted out of about [306K residents](https://ballotpedia.org/New_York_State_Senate_District_21). New York total had about [15.7M](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/20/2018-03372/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2017) eligible voters out of a population of 20M; extending that ratio to the district, that's about 240K voting-age residents and a turnout of about 40%.

So, 60% of the district didn't vote for him. I'd say there's some room for competition.
You should quit while you're ahead.
You realize choosing to not vote is as important as voting right? If there are no candidates you want to vote for, not voting is basically its own candidate.


“Rich man who rules over you violently assaults someone and gets a thousand dollar fine and sometimes has to see a police officer for a little while. This is totally a punishment that will encourage him to change his ways and is totally not at all an absolute slap on the wrist.”
Not only did Bob Menendez not resign, but he was re-elected a few weeks ago.  
No one drinks tea anymore, the equivalent might be dumping iPhones into the bay?
They never specified what they were draining from the swamp. Turn out it was the water, and all that's left is muck.
How did you suppose he was going to accomplish that?
Funnily enough "Drain the Swamp" is something Mussolini said (and did), funny how Trump's campaign is based off of populist fears, and literally rips off Reagan and fascist Mussolini's political campaigns. Yet another blatantly obvious aspect of this man's personality that was ignored by tens of millions of voters...
it was, so now instead of one deep swamp we have a much larger shallow one :) 
Anarchists are the stupidest people in the world. 
Yep.  I just point toward any lawless region of africa as what happens when there is no government.  It's near constant conflict death and starvation.
I'll have you know that supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
What's it really mean? I've heard people say that it means each city or "village" is self-governing, but that's not true anarchy according to most definitions.
From a certain perspective, no doubt.
This! 

Who should this doctor expect to defend him when the state wont even acknowledge direct threats of murder of his children? The state effectively said, "We wont protect you and we will not allow you to protect yourself. Let us know if anyone kills your kids though." 

Feinstein had a CCW, Leland Yee crusaded against guns while dealing RPGs to the Triads. Too many people are willing to sacrifice their freedom for the vague suggestion of safety despite clear evidence that this (and all other governmental control) is about power. 
You posted that to imply it.  If you’re going to say something then own it. 
Correct, but it also doesn't solve the problem in the district. They should have at least two candidates that decently reflect the views in the district; otherwise, that's not called competition, and without it politicians get comfortable (i.e. not afraid of being voted out). Only corruption benefits when that happens.
96.9% is an overwhelming number.  It's close to Putin levels of voter support.

His constituents are getting exactly what they deserve.
> If there are no candidates you want to vote for, not voting is basically its own candidate.

In what possibly way is this the case? When you don't vote what you are practically communicating is "anyone is fine, please don't care what I think". In future elections nobody is going to change position / policy on the basis that it might make non-voters vote for them - instead they will shift to the policies of the person who is getting votes. If you find nobody represents your positions - the best you can do is run yourself - failing that at least vote for the least worst candidate.
Not voting is just voting proportionally to the result.

If you don't vote, you don't matter, you don't change anything unless there is a minimal required amount of votes.
You can leave part of the ballot empty.

That is not voting for a candidate while actually voicing your opinion.
Do you think that minor assaults deserve severe prison time? I don't think that's right, even for poor people. We shouldn't argue that rich people deserve long sentences because poor people get long sentences, we should argue that the justice system should be reformed so that both get shorter sentences.
Which again, doesn't address or refute the comment you replied to.
or everyone quitting their job at the same time
I wonder how many of them are doing/want to do terrible shit and just want the ability to point at it and say “it’s not illegal, what?”  Like that would somehow make it ok
 Oh but if I went 'round sayin' I was Emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away! 
In an anarchistic society, do you believe that your average human member of that society will be more likely to commit immoral actions because there are no laws prohibiting it?

By nature, most people are actually pretty decent people who would not intentionally hurt another person. At that point, it would come down to those who lack empathy for their fellow man and have the capacity to commit violence, and those with both empathy and violent capabilities.

In the end, you would have those with empathy and the capacity for violence protecting those who have empathy but no capacity for violence from those without empathy but have the capacity for violence.

In short, its the sheep dog principle.
Nope. I posted the little evidence we have of Ellison's experience with domestic abuse, which appears to be as a victim.  Everyone, including Ellison, supported an investigation into the recent allegation. Keep reaching though. 
Do you understand that that 96.9% is out of **people who voted**, not **eligible voters**? That those two groups are different?
How about a fine that would actually reflect something other than pocket change? Maybe an actual punishment that affects his life like a thousand dollar fine would to a poor person convicted of assault?
It refutes the idea that democrats resign when caught in scandal.  The only person I can think of off the top of my head is Franken, but that was just so Gillibrand could run for President.  
Better sooner than later ... 
I don’t think you know what anarchism is. 
I like it, and it sounds good in principle, but I still don't think it would ever work with our current society. Government and politics is so ingrained in our culture. Not to mention, technology has been both a blessing and a curse when it comes to unity.
The evidence we have is a mother and her son saying that he beat her.  
Yes.

Of the people who got off their asses and voted, 96% chose Parker.

I haven't calculated the number of people in that district who are too lazy to vote.

Either way - his constituents are getting exactly what they deserve.
I'd be fine with that
The comment said the only people who have resigned are democrats, showing a dem who didn't resign does not refute that in any way.
This looked interesting, but all I got was a shitty embedded rap video.
Why does reddit insist on citing sensational, unreliable sources?
I thought this was already somewhat well-known.  These police officers and the [Rampart Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal) they worked out of were part of what Shawn Ryan based his TV show [The Shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_shield) on.

I've always wondered what life must be like for the murderers of Tupac and Biggie. Knowing that they got away with murdering two of the most famous artists of the last century. I wonder if they ever get the crazy urge to just blab to someone about it. Are we going to see some sort of confession in the next decade? Are kids in 2025 going to be watching a 20/20 special on the murderers of Tupac/Biggie and shrugging their shoulders and asking each other what the hell the big deal is?
Got a more reliable source?

Vid: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eLABXmjySE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eLABXmjySE)
Well, the murderer of Tupac was most likely a crip completely unaffiliated with Bad Boy records, and the murderer of BIG was still most likely and individual unaffiliated with Death Row records... the brag doesn't matter unless you can prove the west coast/east coast battle's consequences led to death.

Your boy is a total idiot and the fact that you support him with your eyes closed is a real shame. 
Facts speak otherwise.

Keep making shit up and and pointing finger, you'll never learn a thing.

He's a Communist....he's a Socialist....he's a Fascist....he's he's he's...trying to pass laws based on OUR ideas!
It takes years for the policies of a President to take hold.  The idea that Obama should have cleaned up Ws mess faster/better, or that we need to go back to the team that lurched the car into the ditch is laughable.

So what's it gonna be?  McCains 9-9-9 plan, Perry,  who apparently cannot form complete sentences in debates, or Romney,  who has to own up to the fact that he basically already implemented Obamacare at the state level.

Obama has not been perfect.  Then again,  he's had the most obstructionist Congress in History, who has said quite publicly that their goal is to ensure he fails. 

In the end it won't matter, both parties suck at the tit of the global Central Bank system. 

What exactly has the Right done to create jobs since they took the House?  Seems to me they are more into pushing their ideology through legislation then fixing anything before the election.


Your ideas maybe.
Typical. Only support something if it affects you.
It's a start. For some people, they need something or someone to connect to so they can understand it.

And, 

> Four years ago, Assemblywoman Teresa R. Sayward, a Republican and a Catholic from a conservative district in the Adirondacks, voted in favor of same-sex marriage after making an impassioned speech about her son’s struggle with his gay identity.

>“The night I took the vote the first time, I was told by my Republican colleagues that I would never get elected again,” she said. **Since then, Ms. Sayward has been re-elected twice.**
Good luck but I'm not optimistic.


No, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!!!
These are not foreigners, these are Americans!  I do not want to get into an argument over whether we should be doing this to non-Americans.  If ever a slippery slope there was, it is this: Stripping Americans of their essential rights as Americans because we want answers.  What these guys did is horrific and inexcusable but our response will tell who we are as a nation and if they have won already.
Tsarnaev is an American citizen. He gets a trial.
I hope so too.
Nice journalism, New York Times.  Not a single mention in this article of Senator Schumer's attempt to turn this bill into a gun control platform.

I wonder why nothing can get done in Washington. And all the news outlets I've read (Like the article above) insinuate that it is republicans being uncooperative.

No matter which side of the fence you are on gun control, you can't blame a senator for not voting for a piece of legislation when a totally unrelated and politically volatile amendment gets thrown in simply to try and force a yes vote.
Obama should just sign an executive order extending the debt limit.
It's not going to happen. It's a curiously light sensation, knowing that we are now too close to the deadline to get anything passed, sealed, approved, signed, delivered, packaged, written, checked, verified, allowed, vouchsafed, and engaged.
wouldnt it be cheaper just to kill them outright?
NO. The GOP is trying to cast occupiers as terrorists, are you insane?
Finally, this movement is seriously gaining momentum. Iowa, NY, Washington D.C., now all the gay community needs is for DOMA to be overturned and then this country will really be on the right track. 
God forbid women should stop shaving their legs!

They'd right go out of business!
I have also noticed a growing trend of ditching the multiblade razors. Many are finally going back to the tried and true double-edged, singled-blade shaving devices.
I rarely shave. When I do, I use a trimmer. I don't care for a close shave and the hassles involved.
Shaving is just a Fad.  P&G is in trouble.
Us men can't take all the blame here- I know a lot of women who admit to not shaving their legs as much during the winter months. 
I'm thinking P&G should be able to come up with some must-have products for the beard-sporting crowd.  They've got a pretty huge product development and marketing infrastructure.
Even the bearded folk shave their necks and cheeks to look clean. I don't think the razor industry has anything to fear. So quit your mongering and make more blades.


Like hairstyles, beards will always fall in and out of fashion as trends evolve through each generation. No worries.



And Welcome to **[CIVILIZATION](http://noose:lmfao "The noose of modern civilization is NECKTIES!")** humans of Earth!
What do you mean? Women naturally have hair on their legs? I call bullshit. Next you'll tell me that they shit just like men do. 
Like they should make pipes, axes, and condoms for us? Really I can't think of anything else a quality beardsman needs.
I shave my neck once a week and have been using the same disposable razor for a year now. 
>Next you'll tell me that they shit just like men do.

Whoa, man, don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration?

Everyone knows that women's anuses evolved the ability to utilize the quantum tunneling effect to teleport an infinitesimal stream of shit directly to the sewage system, thereby bypassing the usual ploppage that men have to deal with.

Duh.
I could think of a few, but I refuse to give them any ideas. Think: hair products - as if hair on one's face is different from the hair on one's head, but you get the idea.
