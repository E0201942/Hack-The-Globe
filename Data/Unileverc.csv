Let's get rid of those stupid bottles of water
The headline is garbage, because it gives no context or timeline.

Reading the article gives a meaningful picture, though. In six years (by 2025) they will cut their new plastic use in half.
I'll still be trying to limit what I buy that is made by this company.
Without reading the article I'm going to guess they're going to make everything smaller and still charge the same amount for it in the name of environmental responsibility.
Fucking greenwashing. I'd be more impressed if they announced that they were stopping production of products that are unneeded.
We can start by not supporting Nestle.
[deleted]
Recycle all the ones we currently have
That’s... reasonable. They are a massive corporation with hundreds of factories - it’s no simple task to change their manufacturing processes overnight, let alone within a few years. Should they just do nothing or set no targets or timelines?
[deleted]
They are going to keep making all their products until people stop buying them. It's about profits, not about what people actually need.
Soooo, most of the US
No I'd buy a Brita and a reusable water bottle
I get that, but there are other ways to get water. Even if you only bought it in reusable 5 gallon jugs and put it in a reusable water bottle, you'd still be doing the world a favor by saving more than 30 bottles of single use plastic trash per 5 gallon refill. You'd also save yourself some money.
I would agree, it seems reasonable - maybe not astounding, or as much as they could manage, but a pretty impressive cut.

I was just pointing out that the headline was stupid and meaningless: Is 400kT 5% of their plastic use, or 95%? Are they going to cut it this year, or by 2093?

So I was just providing the necessary context so that people wouldn't need to read the whole article.
It's not a taste thing for me. It's the reason that this company is the worlds largest producer of single use plastics. I didn't know they bought Talenti what a shame. Luckily I live in a region where I can get small dairy/icecream products from local companies/farms at the market.
Yup, so true. Who knew someone could be both a high pizza wizard and prescient environmental commentator. Multi-talented!
Well after Unilever destroys them (price & quality) I will open the $2 Shave Club...$$$$$$$$$$
[deleted]
DSC uses Dorco brand razors, so I would suggest getting them in bulk off Amazon before the supply runs out or the price is raised.
And now begins it's decline into substandard products.
I signed up 3 months ago. Just in time to start paying full price for razors all over again
Hey guys, did you know DSC uses Dorco products?

Several hundred users in this thread have informed me of this.

Wonder how Billy Burr feels about this. Bill Burr big promoter of DSC. 

"DOCTOR CARVEEEYS EASY SHAVE BUTTAHHHHHHHH!!!!" 
>Dollar Shave Club has 3.2 million members - but has yet to make a profit.

That's kinda surprising? I know they're new and start ups take awhile to make a profit, but still.

>the company is facing legal action from rival Gillette, owned by Procter & Gamble, seeking unspecified damages. It claims that the coating used to strengthen its blades infringes on a Gillette patent.

fuck gillette.
"It costs you a dollar ... They're the highest quality razors in the world, you could slit your wife's throat" -Norm Macdonald
Please help me here. How does a company that was recently appraised at $600 million and has not made a profit yet, sell for $1 billion?
If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. Now watch as Unilever slowly destroys DSC to get their profits back up.
Good for DSC. Bad for customers. 
I highly recommend Harry's instead. Fantastic product. 
Now known as Billion Dollar Shave Club.
I'm fine as long as they keep *Dr. Carvey's easy shave buttaaa*
Is everything now worth billions of dollars? For fucks sake, when I was a kid, a million dollars was filthy rich and that was the goal. I'm 32.

EDIT: Since many are responding about companies having been bought for billions of dollars in the past...so what...again, we are talking about DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB BEING BOUGHT FOR 1 BILLION DOLLARS...CASH...so don't bring up Exxon Mobile and try and compare. Dollar Shave Club sells razors to 3 million subscribers.
"Dollar Shave Club has 3.2 million members - but has yet to make a profit."

Well, they pulled off the con long enough to get acquired.  It's the Silicon Valley dream.
Grow a beard.

Zero dollar shave club.
As sad as it is to see start ups bought out like this, DSC weren't turning a profit and were being sued by Gillette. It was the smart move. Let's just hope Unilever don't ruin it too badly.
How in the fuck is a "4 year old company but has yet to make a profit" worth $1b

Someone explain this.... jesus Christ....
Fuck Unilever.  Costco is full of goddamn Nestle, Kraft-Heinz, and Unilever shit.  We used to get Ben and Jerry quarts until they sold out to fucKing Unilever.  

I dislike these sociopathic companies trying to get their fucking money funnels in every product you want to buy.
So that they can suck every last penny out of it and then bail on the business they destroyed. Cool.
Unilever is expected to rebrand the business as "Fifty Dollar Shave Club"
Dont remember the last time I used a razor. I like my buzzer. I'm not a professional. I do not require a clean shave, thank fuck. 
They betta not change the fowmula to Doctor Carvy's Easy Shave BUTTAAAAAA
I'm a member of the dollar shave club, and it looks like I'll be moving to Harry's next month.
Fuckin shit, that means those fuckers actually worked...Damn it...its too late, now. argggg
Meanwhile I've been using a Phillips cordless electric razor for probably at least 7 years and I never changed the blades amd never use cream. Who's the suckers now?
That happened faster than I anticipated.
I fuckin just signed up for this. Fuck lol
Never thought dollar shave club would end up a unicorn but alas
Man... I wonder how pissed they're gonna be when they go to Dollar Shave Clubs "manufacturing" center and find a laptop with DorcoUSA as a bookmark. 
Ol' freckles did them a solid
Immediately renames to $20 Shave Club.
Doctaaah caaaaaaahrvy easy shave búttah
That's a billion shaves.  Unilever must be pretty freakin hairy.
Billion Dollar Shave Club. 
I'm hoping the general price of razors go down....such a joke price that a company can come out with the same product for rediculously cheaper. I am not sure why Unilever would actually waste the 1b...they could just use the same business model and start doing the same thing.....pretty stupid really.
Ok, enough guys! Go buy a "safety razor ". You can buy blades at the grocery store or even hardware store. After each use, dry off the end and put the end in a jar of oil. The blade won't rust and will be great for quite awhile. This was good enough for our grandfathers why not for us?

Damn, thats more than I would have thought it was worth.  Good for DSC
I can tell you how to shave for WAY less... You'll save thousands and thousands in a lifetime and Unilever I'm sure hates these.

Buy this (safety razor) https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Razor-Double-Edge-Safety/dp/B010OR4KRM/ref=sr_1_23_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1469041095&sr=1-23&keywords=safety+razor

And buy this: https://www.amazon.com/Derby-Extra-Double-Razor-Blades/dp/B0032Q41LS/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1469041255&sr=1-6&keywords=derby+safety+razor

You'll probably shave for 7 or 8 years on this.  It rinses well and does not clog because you can remove the razor and wash it out.  Shaves well, no nics or cuts.  You can also dry the razor if you want after each wash.  Each razor is good for SEVERAL shaves.  I just use soap.  No probs!  

Now, I hope this makes this obstacle in your life better, because these changed my idea of shaving.   Before I spent $ $ on razors... Not any more.  :)  Just read the reviews on the blades.... So many are like WHAT WAS I THINKING BUYING CARTRIDGE RAZORS???
Okay, time to start a dollar and a penny shave club.
Jokes on them, I bought mine for only a dollar. 
Disposable Bic 3 blade razors for $1 each in Canada. Orange package. No predicate needed for that sentence. You know what to do. 
There's speculation that uni bought them for the user information 
Feel like this is intended to eliminate competition by removing competitors that undercut them 
Nothing kills a working product faster than the pressure of the Wall Street side of the business.
[buy em out boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H27rfr59RiE)
Fantastic news! I can't wait to buy the product in stores at a heavily increased price! 5 razors for $14! Count me in, I love spending money! Maybe they'll get and new action blade or an Avenger's special edition. I'm so happy!
You'll make 2 billion dollars. You can sell the company to my new multinational Bilever. 
The Dollar/ish Shaving Club 
No! Seven minute abs!
And then Unilever will sue you for trademark infringement, regardless of the merit of the claim.

Hell, they may even sue me for saying they'll sue you.
[deleted]
Fuck it, I'd go back on my word too for that kind of money. 
People should just buy from Dorco direct anyway. It's cheaper per razor, more options and no monthly fee required.
Dorco aint running out of supply. you dont even have to buy off amazon you can buy straight off their site
You can buy them direct from dorco.
[deleted]
You da real MVP. 
To piggy back off of this, I ordered a box of razors from Dorco a year and a half ago and still haven't run out...it was super inexpensive and the ~~CEO~~ President sent me a friggen handwritten note about a year ago with a coupon and a different free razor. At the time I still had a shit ton of razors so I didn't know what to do with it, but fuck me if it wasn't fantastic service for what I thought was a wholesale bulk purchase.
I do and all is well, may want to buy in bulk as you never know
Link to the Dorco razors on Amazon? I just don't want to buy the wrong kind. and will the blades fit on my current razor from DSC or do I need a new razor?
That's all, folks
Bryers Ice cream used to be great and now it's total shit. Thank's Unilever. 
[deleted]
Pretty sure they just use Dorco products. I got a razor and 10 cartridges (plus the two the razor came with) for $18 on Amazon the other day.
Just start buying their stuff straight from their source.

Aren't they already? :)

I just buy mine cheaper from their manufacturer, Dorco. 
[deleted]
This really bums me out, I used this service for years to get away from shitty companies selling me over priced crap. 
Isn't Gillette unilever? Makes sense for them to buy it and shut it down and jack the prices up.
Already switched to harry's.
They're just rebranded dorco razors 
Look into harry's razors. Been using them for a while, great quality.
Just buy a safety razor. I paid 15 bucks for a nice one and like 8 for 500 blades. I use a blade a week at most. To top it off, it gets me a better shave than the 42-bladed crap at the store. 

Edit: got everything on amazon. Razor was on sale and is now 30 dollars. I made a mistake, and it was 100 blades, not 500. The blades are derby extras. 
Also we're all mouthbreathing plebs for not getting into wet shaving
This is such a hilarious circlejerk.  It's like trigger discipline or Baader-Meinhof.  Many Redditors are OBSESSED with repeatedly pointing out certain random things that are common knowledge to any adult.
But did you know that Dorco is getting those blades from DSC which is now owned by Unilever? 
thanks, now all i picture is a sub sandwich full of razor blades...

Big deal for LinusTechTips as well.
Hey I'm gonna chime in on this comment thread. Go check out F is for Family on Netflix if you haven't yet. It's like King of the Hill except in the 70's and Bill Burr is the Dad.
It's just advertising, he makes that really clear on his podcast. If he doesn't have time to keep up with actual news, I doubt he has time to keep up on dollar shave club news. 
My first thought was, "I hope Bill shit all over this."
That was my first thought: "NOOOO this means the greedy razor corporations won! MUH SHAVE BUTTAHHH". Well, at least we still have MeUndies, made from the finest mottle, modal, motto, model.
A lot of people in this thread are here for Bill Burr comments.  I always thought podcast advertisements were incredibly dumb and had zero reach but here I am looking for the MM podcast community peanut gallery comments.
With their growth, they've likely been reinvesting cash so I wouldn't think too hard about profitability. 

That being said, Unilever definitely has the power to increase their margins. Them dropping Dorco soon is a possibility.
Fucking Gillette indeed. But why sue DSC instead of Dorco?
The latter should be bigger news.  Unable to compete with the startup, the major companies are attempting to push them out of business by bludgeoning them with some patent.
For those who haven't seen, [Norm actually said this while doing an ad for DSC](https://youtu.be/dKHt6IJpXkI?t=538).
Unilever is buying a customer base that aligns with what their future marketing strategy is. There are 3.2 million DSC members and I'm guessing that ~~90-99%~~ 80% are male (thanks to /u/brodeux for the correction). Unilever has a lot of brands that are marketing new 'For Men' products such as Vaseline and Dove.

This customer base aligns with those plans really well. 
How much does your house appraise for? I'll buy it right out from under you for exactly what it is worth.

Wait, you don't want to sell it? Looks like I have two options. I either don't buy it, or I pay a premium to convince you to sell it anyways.
"Future"

There seems to be an utterly mental investment strategy in companies that are vaguely "tech" (meaning they operate though a website) where big companies just snap them up for crazy amounts.
Unilever are just buying up their competition so they can continue to overcharge.

Nobody wants to compete in a perfect market because that would mean minimum wage for executives and no profit for the company.
They should raise the prices, change the name, then sell the "dollar shave club" name and domain to some porn site.
Bad for DSC and Unilever employees too. Unilever needs to recover those acquisition costs lest they offend the almighty shareholders! All aboard the layoff train!
https://www.harrys.com/
Harry's blades last me forever compared to the Mach 3 I was using. I only shave with a blade about twice a week however.
Agreed, I vastly prefer their blades to the DSC/Dorco ones regardless of anything else.
Completely agree. Harry's has a leg up producing their own razors too..not simple rebranding. 
I love Harry's, only shaving product i ever get. Very impressive quality as well
Put me in the Harry's is the bomb camp.  Great razors, cheap price, each blade last a long time.  I just reorder when I'm running low.  They will also send me an email when they think I'm ready to reorder.
If you're not in the 3 comma club, you're nowhere.
They're going to look back at this era and realize how many companies were bought so overvalued...

I mean tech moguls w so much money they dint know what else to do but gamble on the next unicorn.

Don't know how you get a billion valuation w 3 million members and not being profitable. 

WhatsApp at least had 500 million users , if they all paid a dollar per year.....
I don't doubt you were well versed in large business transactions when you were a kid.
You shut your mouth. My pets.com stock has nowhere to go but up!
If I don't shave I look like a low budget Joe Dirt. 
Well, maybe like 5 cent shave club. Still gotta trim your neck. 
There is nothing to ruin besides a name.

You can always buy the same Dorco razors on Amazon with subscribe+save to get the same thing DSC offered. 

Sad? This is a perfect example of a startup success story.
Strangle it, mainly.  Preserve existing profits.
Sounds like a monopoly. Unilever, Nestle, AT&T, Comcast, etc. are over due for a little dicing. Split em up into 20-30 independently owned and operated companies each.
> Fuck Unilever.

I don't want a combo of herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and hepatitis, thanks.
No, it means the brand is valuable. The product is still available under other branding.
Same here. I never change the blades, never had a problem. So much more convenient in every respect than manual razors. Just rub it over my face for 30 seconds every other day or so.

I guess it might be different for people with thicker hair, though.
Safety razors.
Yeah but I'm not going to get a good nut sack or asshole shave with a safety razor.
How did these lose popularity? I switched to a safety razor years ago and will never turn back. They're cheaper and my skin just feels better after a shave.
Those disposable bic razors are absolute shit.

Hipsters shave? 
My wife uses their Shai razors. They are under $17 for 10 cartridges as opposed to the Venus razor she used to use that were around $8 per cartridge. I used to get their razors too and they worked every bit as fine as my Fusion. I just quit shaving my face, so I save even more now. Plus, sometimes I have food saved for later. 
Yeah DSC is just a reseller 
How does it do on your nutsack? 
Takes too much time.
Buy them direct from Dorco USA.

http://www.dorcousa.com/


DSC razors are nothing more than upcharged Dorco razors. All Dorco razor cartridges are interchangeable with their handles, so, yes, any Dorco blade you buy will fit on your DSC handle. This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest advantages of Dorco razors, none of this proprietary "fits the Mach 3, but not the Mach 3 Turbo Deluxe Vibrating Dildo edition"
*Several Dollar Shave Club™*
To be fair it was never the cheapest even for its convenience.
It already was a [rip off](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/does-dollar-shave-really-save-1334930885394).

> The highest-end Dollar Shave Club razor is "The Executive," with six stainless-steel blades, lube strips and a pivoting head, runs $90 over 10 months (razor plus 3 catridges per month). Dorco sells a six-blade model with the same features, the SXA1000. Buying directly from Dorco, a 10-month supply -- the razor plus 30 cartridges -- costs just $28.6

Oh wait, that means that it's packed with air instead of cream.
Buy Tilamook instead! 
Thanks for pointing this out.  I'd only noticed the less per package for the same price shift.
Better yet, switch to safety razors

The upfront cost for a razor is high at like $30 for a good one, but the blades generally cost 10 cents each when bought in bulk, so I probably spent around $2 for blades for an entire year.

Plus you can tell yourself that this was probably the way JFK shaved.
I can't believe people still pay more to buy from DSC.
Yeah, I've got a whole box of Dorco blades and handles under my sink. I bought them during a sale for like $50, 2 years ago. Probably have another year left. 
I got the same from Amazon months ago. One of my better Amazon decisions. I can't believe I used to pay $22 for 4 Gilette cartridges.
You know that Dollar Shave Club is literally just a distribution business, right?   They buy Dorco razors in bulk and resell them to you.  You pay for the automatic shipments.  That's it.  You can buy Dorco on Amazon for cheaper than you get through them.  Same exact stuff.
No; P&G purchased Gillette for $57B back in 2005. 
>They're just ~~rebranded~~ dorco razors

The only DSC branding is the packaging razors come in.
Did you ask Harry if it was OK first!?
Shouldn't they be called Smoothy's?
Doesn't have a Canadian shipping point, though. 

EDIT: downvoted myself because it turns out they've changed that.
How do you shave your balls with this?  It looks dangerous bringing a blade like that anywhere near it.

"Retained earnings" are taken directly out of profits. This means that it *should* always be called profits.

But a news outlet may not use the correct definition for profits though.
Dorco likely has a far more intimidating legal team on retainer would be my guess.  Big companies picking on the smaller ones that can't fight back as hard is nothing new.
Dorco has deeper pockets, but those pockets are guarded by an army of lawyers the likes of which DSC couldn't hope to muster.

Oh thank god, finally a Vaseline just for men. /s
Vaseline for men? Does it smell more masculine as I put a couple fingers in my butt now or what?
It said "male" multiple times in the article, but one of DSC's marketing/ad strategies is "don't pay more for pink" and aimed at women (pretty much identical women's razors and shaving products cost more with the only difference being that they're pink, but the blades are the same). 
My company (I own it) has about 150k "customers" (people that have purchased something from me in the last 5 years).  This means I should be able to sell it for 4.5 million.

Any takers?  I'd sell in a heartbeat. :)
It's not necessarily about making a direct profit from the purchase. They're taking a competitor out of the market. 
Not sure I would want to watch the kinds of people who'll turn up to get shaved for a dollar, or was the idea that you pay a dollar to shave a porn star?

Listen to this shit from their FAQ:

>5) What is a Frozen Dairy Dessert?  
  
>Frozen Dairy Dessert products are made with many of the same high-quality ingredients that are commonly found in Ice Cream – like fresh milk, cream and sugar – and offer a great taste and even smoother texture. According to the FDA, in order for a product to be labeled ice cream, it needs to meet two key requirements:  
  

>Not less than 10% dairy fat   
>A percentage of overrun that results in a finished product weighing more than 4.5 pounds per gallon
>Anything that does not meet both of those requirements is not considered ice cream.  
  
>6) Why did Breyers make the change to Frozen Dairy Dessert?  
  
>Our consumers are at the center of every recipe decision we make. We work hard to understand what people want most and work to give them the best possible product experience. People have told us they have various flavor or texture preferences. For example, some tell us that they want a smoother texture, which is what we’re able to deliver with our Frozen Dairy Dessert products  .
  
>7) Does Frozen Dairy Dessert taste different than Ice Cream?  
  
>We  have conducted several national taste tests across different flavor profiles to determine how our Frozen Dairy Dessert products perform against ice cream on important product attributes. In these side by side taste tests, our fans told us they liked the new recipe just as much as the original.  
  
>The  ultimate measure of consumer feedback is whether our consumers are purchasing the product. Breyers Blasts!, which has a Frozen Dairy Dessert standard of identity, is the most popular and fastest-growing segment of our business.  
  
>8) Are there nutritional benefits to Frozen Dairy Dessert?  
  
>Frozen Dairy Dessert tends to have less fat than ice cream.  
  


>10) What is the packaging difference between Ice Cream and Frozen Dairy Dessert?  
  
>These products follow all Legal & Regulatory requirements for packaging, and thus claim Frozen Dairy Dessert on the front of pack. Additionally, the ingredient list and nutritional information is updated to reflect changes.

WTF is Tilamook "Farmstyle" Gelato?

Not too many farms I know make gelato.
Tilamook ice cream is fucking delicious.
My god this is probably the best ice cream I've ever bought. And I live in Texas "Blue Bell" country. 
Newsflash, unlike Bryers, Tilamook isn't nationwide.
Yeah sure, but look what happened to JFK.
Or just buy a really good straight razor once!  Just be careful, your cat might brush up against your leg and you might slit your throat, be wary of that. 
I made the switch but DSC 5 blades gave me the best shave ever, it was so easy. The problem is they were too good and one blade could last me 2 weeks to a month, and I didn't want to keep pausing my subscription when either I decided not to shave, or I ended up with a stockpile of old blades. 
/r/wicked_edge is leaking again...

I kinda want to switch from electric to a DE but I feel like I'm too incompetent to not cut myself...

Ironic for someone that works with a scalpel...
Yes! I switched to this 4 years ago. Extremely cheap, better shaves and more importantly, the shaving process is that much more fun.
I suggested this to someone in another thread and he said "then I have to store a bunch of razors" and i was unceremoniously downvoted for suggesting that's a ridiculous problem.
You can buy Dorco from Dorco, too. I order twice a year. 
I guess in that case it also makes sense for Unilever to get some skin in the game. But I'm still surprised, the word dollar is in the brand name, can't easily bump up pricing without alienating every single customer.
I bought both (DSC first and then dorco off slick deals), IIRC there is DCS Brand on the actual handle itself as well, but otherwise identical. 
Yes it does. My brother and I bought my dad a subscription for Christmas.

I shave my balls with my Edwin Jagger safety razor with feather blades. I apply a nice lather of my Taylor of old bond street lavender shaving cream around the area and take my time.

Apart from that is almost the same way that with a standard razor, it's just that I takes time for you to start shaving your balls with it, because you first have got to master shaving your face and develop your technique. This may sound boring and such a long process but you save a ton of money.


Electric razors are dry.
Sounds like you might have a serious case of "Being a Little Bitch." The only known cure is to dry shave your face with a straight razor until you develop a thick callous, which you can then use to sand lumber to the desired smoothness, and to abrade the knuckles off of anyone foolish enough to try punching you in the face.

I'm surprised Gillette waited this long. Dorco has been making the same thing for a while, it's only when a facilitating service came along wide spreading it to consumers did Gillette finally take action. It's sad to see the uphill battle that new companies have to deal with just to get good service going. It's just like the show Silicon Valley, really

EDIT: Well, Gillete vs Dorco has happened in the past, so part of what I said isn't true, but the uphill battle for DSC is still relevant.

Yea but DSC doesn't even make the blades how can they be sued? 
They won't get away with that now that Unilever owns DSC. I'd imagine that lawsuit will go away quietly.

Welcome to the 0.05 dollar shave club!
So what you're saying is that my penis is going to shave my nuts for me. Got it. Sounds dangerous, that guy is pretty stupid sometimes
No, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy! 
I tried all the razors Dollar Shave Club sells. The basic two blade razor does the job and gives me less irritation. I feel like a fool for spending thousands of dollars on Gillette Mach Turbo 666s for the last ten years when I could have used the cheap dinkers and been fine.
Their base razor is $3. 1$ for the razor. 2$ for shipping. I get the executive for $9. Still cheaper than Gillettes. 
Their razors are just generic south korean made razors. Nothing special. Same as supermarket own brands. It's available all over the world from a variety of sources. 

I hate gimmicks like this. calling it "the executive" and blurbing it with "The final frontier - it’s like a personal assistant for your face." and "This blade comes from the future and lives in outer space". No, it's a fucking generic asian-made no-brand six blade razor. 

I hate bullshit like this; that's why I'm not in sales, that's why i'll probably never be a billionaire or a multi-multi-millionaire. I can't stomach bullshitting like this.
Why are people using Dollar Shave club? a DE safety razor has been around for ages, and $10 worth of blades will last you a year. This service was outdated the moment it was invented.
*only $1/day, plus tax, fees and membership, shipping rates apply*

"Our product is great because people will still eat it and we don't need to use all those expensive "real" ingredients! What's that? They should cost less? Haha, you're adorable! Same price."
#6 drives me nuts.
Breyers had a distinct product -- simple ingredients, a unique texture that was not as 'smooth' as other frozen dairy products with thickeners, and had a very clean, pure taste. People bought Breyers *because* of these differences. Once I found Breyers, I wouldn't buy anything else unless I wanted something distinctly different, like Ben & Jerry's.

Now for some reason, the marketing department decides to go out and ask consumers -- probably random consumers across the ice cream preference spectrum -- and they change their formula to be -- guess what? -- just like all the other ice creams!! They now have a me too product that has no relation to their earlier products, and they've lost me as a customer and I'd bet they have lost a lot of others.

Why don't companies stick to their distinctive competencies? Be bold and be different! Stand out from the crowd!
"Liked it as much as the original product" ... Then why change it?
I mean, they make a good point - if their research indicates that people prefer Frozen Dairy Dessert to Ice Cream, they're going to manufacture the Frozen Dairy Dessert.

Personally, I stick with Tillamook's ice cream, but the customer is always right, and Breyers is listening to their customers. If the customers decide that Frozen Dairy Dessert sucks ass, Breyers will discontinue it and go back to Ice Cream.

Someone is buying it. It ain't me, but *someone* is. They wouldn't be making it if no one were buying it.
I just blew my wife's mind, I didn't know this either but have avoided Bryers since I noticed a major difference in quality a long time ago.
My mom is sooo convinced it doesn't matter. She also thinks that processed cheese products are "cheese". If it was cheese, wouldn't it be called cheese and not some long ass title.        

Apparently, if it's cheap, she'll buy it. Doesn't matter if it's full of shit that doesn't belong in your body. Ironically, she's also super against preservatives. We have a gallon of Hawaiian Punch in our fridge right now.
Same thing happened to me, there was little "ice cream" left in the box so I flipped it upside down in the sink and promptly forgot about it until the next day. How is there still solid pieces? The will to live is strong in this stuff
I find that no matter how cold your freezer is, Breyer's Ice Cream is always room-temperature chemical sludge.
They're still a valuable brand because of all of that '90s marketing that talked about how, "all natural," it was.

Better yet, just find a piece of obsidian for free.
I know it's a joke, but people really exaggerate how dangerous straights are.  You're far more likely to cut yourself chopping onions.
You can do every other month. Or... you could. I can't speak to what shit unilever is gonna stir.
My father has this issue as well. He's retired now, so he no longer shaves every day. His DSC order continues unchanged. I was helping him fix his bathroom sink last weekend. Stacks and stacks and stacks of DORCO under there.
It's very simple and as long as you drag the blade in a straight line (don't turn, don't go sideways) you're very unlikely to cut yourself.  
I tried using a good safety razor for about 2 months.  Told myself "this is how real men shave!" It was a pain in the ass every single time I shaved and it was never any smoother or more comfortable than my DSC razors - in fact, it was a lot more work for a worse result.  I went back to the DSC razors and never looked back, although I do still use my boar bristle brush with real shaving soap.
I switched. Practised for a month. Got it down.

Do it.
I refuse to switch just because of how obnoxiously some people push it. As if it's some life-altering thing to shave with a fucking straight razor. 
Were you in the subreddit where everyone tries to live with like only a chair and a smartphone or whatever?
Who says they're going to jack the prices up? The company already has a successful business model based on people who don't realize you can just buy from the source for cheaper. 
Very carefully
Honestly I would never risk that, I hate it enough when soap stays on my balls too long let alone putting shaving cream on there while I slowly work a DE razor over it.  Time is valuable anyways and the savings over a safety razor is not enough for me to use a DE all the time.  Carefully using a DE does give a closer shave but it takes way more time and honestly within a few hours my stubble grows back anyway so I'm not sure there's any practical benefit to a scary close DE shave.

It took Gillette a decade to put another blade on a razor. From conception to launch, to make the mach 3 razor.

I looked at that dollar shave shit and it was fairly expensive and I don't see how it makes much sense. I bought a $20 straight edge and 100 blades for $18, makes much more sense. 
No shit. You start a  shaving cream and razor company and someone offers you **a billion** dollars for it, you fucking sell it to them. 
$25 for the razor, $5/year for blades.
Honestly. Everyone's like "$17 for 10 blades, what a steal!" Try $17 for 100 blades, and you don't have to continue using them after they're uncomfortably dull.
Bought a 100 pack of blades for my safety razor in... 2014 I think?  Still have a way to go
Safety razors are great if you have the time to learn to use them and the time to use them each morning. I have a $30 electric that takes me 30 seconds to use each morning - no blood, no cream cup, no brush to clean, no blades to replace, and it cuts close enough to hide my dark dark brown stubble and make my wife happy.

Just an alternative, safety razors work for some people, but my electric is much better for me.
Obligatory /r/wicked_edge plug
I gave him a dollar.
Try an old timey safety razor.  You can get packs of 100 blades for around 10 bucks.  Mine gives a great, dirt cheap shave.  It also looks pretty cool.  The only problem is if you hack at your face like an idiot you could cut yourself, but so far in the three years I've been using mine I haven't had anything more than an occasional scratch.  I kick myself for ever using any other kind of razor.  I've saved so much money with this.

They you'll sure feel stupid when you discover safety razors!
ive been using the same razor i was sent via mail coupon for the couple years what the hell is wrong with you people that you need a new blade every few days

Nah, think you're in the minority here pal. On Reddit people love to circle jerk Wicked Edge but the truth of the matter is that 90% of guys are totally content with dollar shave club razors. I don't care about anything better when one Gillette razor lasts me two months and it requires no special knowledge to use.
Hey, some people want a "smoother texture" in their ice cream.

There's no way their research actually said that though.  What it likely did show is that they can substitute this inferior product with much higher profit margins, and the loss of customers will be outweighed by the substantial increase in profits.

Just hold the beard in through sheer masculine will.
But I HAVE cut myself chopping onions, and at least that was just my finger!
Given that I used to cut myself regularly while using a safety razor and that I've never cut myself while chopping onions (which I did daily for some time!), I'm having some trouble believing your claim. Surely you exaggerate.
Care to explain?

Also, I'd rather mess up and cut my thump open than sneeze and knick my carotid arteries.

So, even if you're right and you are more likely to be cut yourself chopping onion, the area where you are risking being cut is WAY worse with a safety razor and thus more dangerous, IMO 
You guys know you can get them on amazon for cheaper right?  I just order a stack of 10 blades every few months.
Unless you're one of us unlucky ones with not perfectly smooth skin. Safety razors slice little bumps or pimples off with no remorse, and then you bleed like a stuck pig for an hour.
> you're very unlikely to cut yourself. 

My amount of luck does not cover "very unlikely," unfortunately.
Its not a straight razor, its a safety razor.
Nut up and Nair that shit. 
That all sounds pretty good except for the estrogen blockers. Instead, I would seek out a local population of black bears and kill one with your bare hands, then eat it's testicles raw. Do this 3x per week. If you are concerned about pathogens, lightly bread the testicles in an egg and flour mixture, then fry in butter over medium heat. If time allows, skin the bear and make a hooded cape out of its hide. Wear this while cooking the testicles. 
Another one, a company was advertising during the Embedded podcast (pretty good podcast btw) and each episode the whole ad was, "so and so sponsored this podcast, and they want us to just get to the podcast, so here we go." 

Obviously I forget the company's name now, but point is -- after hearing this three or four episodes, and feeling thankful that I didn't have to listen to some crappy ad, I finally said "I have to know who these guys are," and googled them.  Turns out they're a marketing company, which I personally have no need for, but if I did they would have sold me just via that demonstration. I loved it.

It varies from person to person -- my razor was $40 (Merkur 34C), and 100 blades (Astra) lasts me roughly 2 years, so about $10/year on blades. 

That said, it is very worth it.
> uncomfortably dull.

I think you just unintentionally summed up how i've been feeling about myself lately 
I always, ALWAYS had to deal with razor burn and minor ingrown hairs with disposable multi-blade razors. Haven't had a single issue since I switched to safety razors.
Spent $20 for a whole pile of blades, bought from a warehouse-ish outlet. That pile lasted me 3 years.
That's the greatest thing about shaving with a safety razor. If you want you can shave with a brand new blade every day of the month and you'll *still* spend less than buying even cheap cartridge razors. 

SHE gave him a dollar!
I just went to the company that DSC sources their blades from and bought like 74$ worth of shaving stuff like three years ago, haven't run out yet...
Yup. Safety razors are the shit. Would highly recommend. Get a feather razor so it's all stainless and will last forever and buy blades at $.10 per blade and some nice shaving soap or cream and you end up saving tons. 
I picked up one from an amazon lightning deal last year. World of difference. It was a kit, and came with 100 blades for something like $15. Gives an excellent shave, doesn't clog like the other styles, and gives a great chin line with the single edge (beard, so I basically just shave my neck).

Definitely a game changer for the thrifty as well as someone who just wants a good shave.
yes. /r/wicked_edge 
I feel like I'm the only person who had a terrible DSC experience haha. I'd have to to shave over the same spot a dozen times and my skin would always be so irritated by the time I was done. It was like shaving with a spoon.
Safety razors? Too expensive and uppity. I use a windshield ice scraper that i found in a parking lot that's been honed to a fine edge by rubbing it on the side walk. Anything else is a waste of money. 
I already feel stupid without discovering anything!
Some people grow thick, coarse facial hair. Some don't. I have fine hair and my safety razor blades will stay sharp for close to 2 weeks. I could use them longer but I like a close, non irritating shave. I bought my dad a safety razor his blades last like 4 days.  
  
These blades cost less than a dime a piece, it hardly feels wasteful to change them when they become less effective. 
I've made ice cream that had lumps and a somewhat grainy texture ( didn't dissolve all the sugar I guess) so I've have actually said this. 
By "smoother" they mean "melts in a second and feels like grainy sugar water."

So. Fucking. Gross.

Thanks for ruining a once great ice-cream brand, Unilever sucks.
Literally, at the heart. Those aren't strawberry swirls...
It was probably fish paste
Nahh. Their consumers are at the center of every recipe decision, definitely not the profits. 
Not even the cheese??????
It is, but if you request it, it can move east. 
You guys deserve it then. Their products are very good all around in my experience. 
I thought sheer masculine will pushes out more beard.
I've found the easiest way to do this is play Billy Idol songs into your ears 24 hours a day. Helps maintain focus.
Pfft, you have 10 of them for a reason.
It's pretty hard to really cut yourself with a straight razor, let alone a safety razor.

I use both regularly (switched 10 years ago) and have never cut myself in any real way.  The worst I've gotten are a few tiny spots of blood like you sometimes get with cartridge razors.

The blades aren't designed to cut deep like a chef's knife, and its easy to focus on something right up at your face.  

Also contrary to TV, you don't apply pressure, or point the knife edge in towards the skin at any point.

So my point is you can switch and shave the rest of your life with a straight razor, and you'll continue to get your only deep cuts from cooking where you chop and slice with force near skin.
that's why you get a styptic pencil. no more bleeding like a stuck pig. you just jam the thing in the wound until it stops stinging, and that's it. no more blood. plus, and this is going to sound metal, but after a while of shaving with a DE your skin gets smoother. 
My skin isn't all that smooth, I must be pretty lucky.  Gotta do what works best for you :)  I like the electric from time to time, if it's short it doesn't take me as long that way.
It's actually better to fry the testicles in bacon fat than in butter. A combination of the two also works acceptably.
Me undies me undies
Kind of, and yet I appreciated the complete lack of pink. 
I cut myself way more with multi-blade razors.
Astra are the only blades I've used that don't make me feel like I'm peeling my face off.
That math doesn't compute... 100 Astra blades is $11.99 on Amazon. If the box lasts you 2 years that comes out to $6/year. Not $10/year. 
Well then I guess it's time for you to

Same. I work with radioactive material that requires I wear a respirator. So I need to (ideally) shave every other day for work...I had to talk to my employer and be like, "the most I can manage is 2x per week, otherwise I won't be allowed to work with radioactive material *at all* because I'll have open, bleeding wounds on my face."

Then I switched to safety razors. Omg. WHY DID MEN EVER SWITCH. Marketing is bullshit. "More Blade$ = Clo$er $have!!"
Hmmm, i wonder how they would be for bikini area and legs? Razor burn sucks.

do you know if their cartridges fit the DSC handles? 
Any recommendation on brand or where to buy the razor and replacement blades?
Life pro tip, shave after you take bath. Hair would be soft and shave will be smooth. Plus blade will last longer
I get ~2-4 shaves per blade with a safety razor but there so cheap I change them out with out worry.  I remember using mach III blades until I tear up before replacement
I'm a chemist with a particular interest in food science, so I can weigh in a little bit here.

You probably didn't freeze your ice cream fast enough. Ice (as well as other crystalline materials) will form larger crystals if it cools down slowly vs very quickly because the water molecules will have a chance to line up and form longer, more ordered chains. Unfortunately, this leads to a grainy, mealy mouthfeel which is sort of unpleasant in ice cream. 

If you freeze your ice cream mix more quickly (liquid nitrogen ice cream is a great example of this), the water doesn't have a chance to form those large crystals, leading to a much smoother ice cream.

If you want to learn a little more about the history/science of ice cream, there's [a great podcast called Gastropod that has an entire episode covering it](https://gastropod.com/the-scoop-on-ice-cream/).
That's probably ice crystals, not sugar. More sugar will actually help with that, or more fat, plus making sure the mix never gets a chance to partially melt/refreeze.
Aren't original Krabby Patties made of crab?
Clearly. Why else would they write an entire FAQ about how they just looooooove to please their customers
The only reason I know it is a west of the Mississippi brand is I am pretty sure Tilamook is a Pacific Northwestern Native American tribe word.

Well, of course he's not gonna go away, Mary! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more! 
Bitches leave
A hilarious bonus would be if all the DSC subscribers dropped from the company and just bought direct - wasting Unilever's investment.  I despise that company, they ruin every brand they touch - they turned Breyers ice cream into frozen plastic sugar milk...
I bought a bunch of different styles from them (variety pack) and like the 3 blade the best.  Mostly because it's the easiest to flush out stubble bits.   The 6 blade clogs too easily for me and engineer me thinks 6 blades is overkill.

I would not have guessed DSC was worth a Bazillion.

Yep.  And also the lady friend uses them for her legs, and we still have reserves!
But now you have to buy beard oil.  And books on how to trim.

PaperPhoneBox sleuthed it - the nicest part about having a legit shaving stock is the same as buying like a 24 roll of toilet paper - you just forget about worrying about it for quite a while and don't have the recurring costs associated with multiple small buys.
They do, the DSC Executive is the pace 6.  I am now noticing a Pace 7, time for upgrades!
I use a Feather razor. Astra makes decent blades for fairly cheap. But I will say that it's worth buying a small variety of blades first before buying in bulk to see what works on your skin. Your skin sensitivity and whether you have really good shaving technique down or not really influences what blades you should buy and what type of safety razor you should use, as well as creams and so on. Basically anyone that swears there is some "perfect" razor is lying to you. You have to find what works well for you.

I really like Personna blades from Amazon coupled with Cella shave soap. It's in a small red bowl. Smells amazing, lathers well and gives a nice, smooth shave. I bought an inexpensive steel handle from Sally Beuty supply with a butterfly opening mechanism. It's been great as well. No need for an expensive Feather or other high end handle for your first. Just make sure the alignment piece in the middle keeps the blade straight.
I like my Merkur razor (34C).  I use Astra blades, but get a sample pack from Amazon and use what works for you.  Feather blades get a lot of hype but didn't work well for me as well as being about the most expensive blade you can get.  Even with Astra I found the super stainless was much better for me than platinum.  Merkur's blades were really hit or miss, one would be great, the next would give me tons of irritation.
Check out the sidebar on /r/wicked_edge 
Shit, shower, shave, in this order.  Best results hands down 5/7.
That's my current method, makes a big difference for sure. Or I put a warm wet towel on my face for a minute or two if I don't have much time. Neck is still the toughest though 
The tour at Ben & Jerry's in Vermont goes over this and shows off their blast chiller room that supposedly cools down their ice cream faster than any other big name in the industry. It was a lot more interesting than I expected.
I thought they were made of whale. Mr Krab's got his hands on a whale somehow, and that's the secret ingredient. That's also how he got Pearl, who was now orphaned, and maybe even why he keeps her around.
But a manly man never goes back.
Hey whats up everybody its bill but and immmmmmmmmm^m^m^mmmmmmmm

JUST CHECKIN IN ON YA
I cut myself more with a safety razor. Not often, but more than with a cartridge. But I'd gladly take a few nicks considering I don't get razor burn or irritation with a safety razor like I did using a cartridge.
My imaginary friend Boo-Boo the dinosaur needs $3.50 to join dollar shave club.
Breyers used to be amazing ice cream. Weren't they made to change the package wording to Dairy desert instead of ice cream?
Good god Brewers is awful. I remembered it being good when I was a child but hadn't bought any in a long time. I recently picked up a carton at the store and it was a complete 180 from what I remembered. It tasted dry, if that's even possible for ice cream. I don't know how to describe it properly but it was just horrible and bland and flavorless. Blech. 

I thought maybe I was just being silly but then my SO commented on how bad it tasted and I knew it wasn't just me. I'll never buy breyers again. 
I worked in a frozen yogurt store in high school where we "sold" Breyers, but the owner hated it so we actually sold Welsh Farms, but kept all of the Bryers signage or Franchise headquarters would have flipped their shit.  Any time we had a visit from headquarters we would swap it back for Breyers.  

The best part is - we used to have this old timer as a regular.  He was convinced FEMA was really behind a new world order.  Anyway, he used to say our "Breyers" was good but it doesnt beat Welsh Farms.  I miss that place.  
Doubtful. Every time DSC gets mentioned on reddit, it's followed up by at least 1 post directing them to /r/wicked_edge and at least 1 post directing them to purchase blades on Dorco or Amazon directly.

I lucked out and the supermarket near my house actually sells Dorco blades under their own brand for about the same price as if I went direct to Dorco.
Oh no, that's the company that bought DSC? I just joined the club too. ☹
Sounds a bit more complicated than my current setup lol 
Astra super platinum guy here. Nice blades for cheap. Ymmv
This guy is spot on. Feather blades are great for me, but don't start with them. You'll get cut up. Different things work for different people.

It's only slightly less forgiving than Gillette, honestly, so don't be afraid of trying. I can shave in 5-10 minutes, so it's only a few minutes slower.

Better for your skin, too; if you have sensitive skin or acne I've found that using better shaving soap / products can help a lot, and the safety razor irritates my skin less. Again, everyone has different skin/hair.
Tactical retreat!
Funny. isn't Unilever basically responsible for some 'swamps' of their own in the form of pollution on this planet? I seem to recall some woman in India making a song about it. Right i remember. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/indian-rapper-sofia-ashraf-success-protest-song-unilever


They should let them pull the ads then. People are ready to leave FB and Google if better alternative pops up and one of the big reasons is due to the changes google and FB have made in an attempt to monitor and control content. Advertisers are pressuring companies to take away the very things that give these platforms value.
>"We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain ... which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency,"

Unilever is upset that they are spending a ton on marketing yet don't get to see how the algorithms place the ads and whether they are being associated (being paired with) "clean" web pages and content. 

This is a reasonable complaint. If you advertise on a billboard, or during a sporting event, or in a magazine, you get to know the location or content your advertisement is being paired with. 

That said, I think it's unreasonable for the world's largest social media platform and the *de facto* world search engine eliminate "harmful" content. Either the algorithms need to improve to allow advertisers to circumvent harmful content (or possibly whitelist certain sites) or these companies need to charge less for advertising when they can't guarantee placement with quality content.
Suddenly Unilever crimes become a trending subject on YouTube and go viral on Facebook. 
The body wash company is gonna determine what newspeak is ok? Ahhh ok, cool. 
Gee, CNN writing an article with a clickbait title about how YouTube and Facebook is bad. Main stream cable media shitting on the internet, I never thought I'd live to see the day! \s

"We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain ... which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency" -Unilever

That sounds a lot more like they are concerned that they don't know the algorithm for how their ads are delivered. The swamp reference was about transparency. It's the equivalent of, "as clear as mud." It had nothing to do with content.

I won't miss the death of CNN. They are quickly becoming the Fox of the left. A hollow shell of what they once were; a fungus feeding off of the continuing degeneration of our public discourse.
Yeah...pay millions for lobbyists in Washington like we do damnit!
Interesting... so a company that normally pays money to get its brand names out there has somehow stirred up a news story about its brand names and how they are trying to fight the good fight on behalf of people.  I see that the individual brand names they sell are conveniently mentioned in this article as well.  Hmmmmmmm
Who decides which story is real and which is fake?  Depends on which agenda is being pushed I guess.
I see alot of good/bad content getting filtered/sanitized in the future.  
Good for them. Most people dramatically underestimate the damage these platforms are doing by not policing themselves adequately.  It’s artificial intelligence. algorithms to recognize and weed out fake websites, fake accounts...etc... 
They can do it.  They must. They know this. Been talking about this worst case scenario and the next one for years. 
Advertisers are the only thing that will force them. 
I’m not gonna judge the advertisers threatening to pull out and cry hypocrite unless there’s a direct correlation. Like unilever  coming out with an add suggesting we protect wetlands more. Bad example, but you get the idea. 
I support Facebook and Google on this, let them do what they want and lose money over ads.
Unilever...of all companies
I have never heard anything good about Unilever, but "swamp" is an apt description for what those two fucking companies have done to the internet. 
Time to put Unilever on my ban hammer


Good, finally we have companies standing up to the Orwellian tactics used by Facebook and Google.
.... oh, good, his language is spreading to CNN. that's not worrying.
True it’s somewhat hypocritical, but I can’t fault them for exerting their influence to get big tech to clean things up.

> They are quickly becoming the Fox of the left

CNN is insufferable, granted, but NOTHING is the lying POS Fox "News" is.

Laying down false equivalence is a sign of sheer laziness of mind.  Criticize CNN for what it is - a cesspool of constant "expert" panels yelling at each other - rather than equating it with Fox - a cesspool of lies, racism and deliberate obfuscation for the Reich Wing.

They are separate.
No, they aren't.

You have just been fooled by conservatives.  Let me guess you are around 20-25 and you don't remember cable news before 9/11?
Oh look. Bad people on both sides argument. 


This question always comes up, and it's a non-issue. Fake news on there are things like "Greg Ostertag stabs miley cyrus with a plastic spoon". There are black and white fake articles like that, and that's what a lot of companies, and people are taking a stand against. Facts that simply aren't true.
Any of these misleading headlines, spin, bias, etc are fake. That shit needs to change. People have every right to not trust the news.
What determines if its "real" or "fake" is if advertisers want to be associated with the news and if they could generate revenue. That is all. 
Reality decides which stories are real and fake. Every news story has some sort of implicit or explicit bias, since they are written by humans, but it's not that hard to avoid making straight up lies.
The people decide.

The problem is in part hysteria, one person posts/sees an article that may be true or false. Then probably shares it with some kind of caption or fly text video with "CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS!?!?" or something to that extent. Then all their mindless followers see it as gospel and don't question it at all.
Sure you can, just have the cynical outlook that they are only doing this to look good and increase profits which they will in turn use to cause even more damage to the world.
Not saying google or facebook are clean at all. The pots calling the kettle black.
hog wash?
The only two words I hear on CNN is "Trump" and "Russia" since the election and why I stopped watching it.  It isn't a news show, it is paid propaganda that pretends its news.  
The media has been 24/7 anti-trump nonsense and anti-social media nonsense. They have been on a relentless propaganda spree. It's surreal. 

I guarantee you that we'll have another story about facebook or social media tomorrow.

how's that koolaid?
CNN literally more than seven years ago is relevant how? 
What about the large host of ANONYMOUS SOURCES SAY that we deal with daily from even large news companies?

Are we going to regulate that they have to show their sources?
Justin Bieber is dead?!

This is not true.
You are lying.
Or maybe "the swamp" includes environmental activists too.
I don’t see myself buying more Dove/Lipton/Axe and other Unilever brands because of this act. Not all good acts come from noble intentions. Sure it’s self-serving for Unilever, but that doesn’t mean there’s no greater benefit to the rest of us or that we still can’t object against them polluting. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unilever_brands
Which flavor do you imagine I'm drinking?

At least I'm not chugging on that piss called Fox, meant to Outrage! the masses with lies and racism.
There’s already regulation for that, and it’s called defamation. The issue is that most of the time, actually corrupt people can’t make it through the discovery phase without implicating themselves and so they don’t pursue it.
If it weren't for anonymous sources, Nixon would never have resigned.
No.  Happy now?
No, because that's how journalism works.

Anonymous does not equal false, no matter what Trump says.
Understand that those stories are only rumors and conspiracies until evidence is presented.  
Yep, and he was killed by Allan Rickman
It really is that simple.  A lot of obfuscating going on in here...  Some of you have lost all sense of reason.
It is very much the way things are though.
Exactly! It’s shocking how much otherwise-“enlightened” young redditors are willing to sign off of ~~censorship~~ *curation* in their social media because they’re upset about Trump. Remember how few mainstream news organizations were covering the Dakota Access Pipeline!? How conveniently the FCC found a reason to purge the public comments?! We’re helping them kill the internet. 
We can however fault them for trying to turn every online platform into the same bullshit that YouTube is right now. 
Is it "Whataboutism Watermelon"?
Which is why it's so fucked up what journalists have done this to their own profession. I'd wager that lawyers won't be treated as the "dishonest" profession in the future, and you'll see journalism take its place.
None of that makes any sense.
Even tho you can't.  Youtube got that way because of people like Paul and Youtube letting computers run the show.
Dunno.  Who was equating news stations again?

Nope, wasn't me.
Done what to their own profession?

Ya... I'll take that bet. If only Reddit allowed us to gamble our useless karma.

Merge everything into one big company. What could possibly go wrong?
>Kraft backs out of Unilever bid after hostile reception (reuters.com)

**GOOD**

Unilever has a history of social activism from its foundation as the Sunlight Soap company helping improve the health and hygiene of Victorian England. It was first among the world’s top 10 food companies in Oxfam’s Behind the Brands 2015 ratings for policies on land and water usage and women’s rights, putting it ahead of Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Kellogg and Mars.

Anyone that worked in public health and had contact with Unilever knows that Unilever, despite all its faults, is an organisation which thinks sustainably and long term and seeks to share benefits.

Kraft is the exact opposite. The worst kind of business ethics
Too bad, was really looking forward to those edible shampoo product lines. 
**For all the americans who don't know about 3G**

The merger was backed by 3G Capital and Warren Buffet.

What exactly is 3G Capital ? It's a brazilian private equity firm that is run and controlled by a man named Jorge Paulo Lemann. He is a good friend of Warren Buffet who called him a "great guy" that he "admires". Warren Buffet had previously called Goldman Sachs a great bank with great leaders - the same bank accused of selling falsified products while betting against it's own client - so it's worth looking into the people he admires.

Well who exactly is that "great guy" ? He is an Oligarch. He is one of the richest men in Brazil and in the world. He has been accused of widespread corruption and bribery. He build part of his huge wealth received state backed loans below inflation rates. He is basically part of the fucking KLEPTOCRACY MAFIA that is running Brazil to the ground.

I was reading the newspaper and when I learned 3G capital was involved, I wanted to vomit. 
You Yanks stay away from marmite ya hear.
Warren Buffet, nice looking old guy who's still a giant piece of shit. Can anybody trust someone who owns a company as shitty as Kraft?
No one wants to eat Unilever Mac-n-Cheese.
Maybe no one wants to be bought out from Kraft with the reputation they have for processing and borderline poisoning products with preservatives 
Good. Americans should stay out of our businesses. It's bad enough that Unilever is half-British now. Not to mention how ridiculous it would be, since Kraft is a much smaller business.
> However, the U.S. food group had not factored in Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman dismissing its offer as having no financial or strategic merit and refusing to come to the table.

Wow, that is.... Unexpected. Wonder what the idea is behind that? Not wanting to get swallowed up and figure everyone at their company is going to get early retired or canned?
> was enough to put off 86-year old Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has a long-held aversion to making hostile bids, sources told Reuters.

Shame he didn't have the same attitude when they took over Cadbury's :(
So Kraft is refusing to be part of a deal already refused by Unilever?  Yeah, I wasn't fired; I quit after you had security throw me out!
> However, the U.S. food group had not factored in Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman dismissing its offer as having no financial or strategic merit and refusing to come to the table.

I wonder if the board at any other corporation would just hold a meeting and fire that CEO.
I suspect that Warren's concerns are not with this merger per se as much as the political backlash that has predictably grown in recent decades.  Warren's bigger concern is with the potential dissolution of Berkshire Hathaway along with scores of other anti-competitive financial trusts that have emerged in the wake of Sherman Antitrust Act marginalization.  It's a valid concern given the widespread economic consequences caused by decades of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. and abroad.
Ah yes, American saint Warren Buffett creating jobs yet again!

Was reading up on Unilever's history.

1910s–1920s
The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[10] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[11]


Just trying our revenge because a British company bought and then renamed Sears Tower in Chicago to Willis Tower. 

Still salty about that one tbh. 
That's not how global capitalism works.
Unilever has always been half British; it was formed in 1930 by the merger of a British and a Dutch company.
Yeah, let's have Dutch business staying where it belongs.
You do realize that's how M&A's work. Generally the larger business cannibalizes the smaller one. Also they are both in consumer goods so actually it does make sense from that standpoint. So, yeah, what was your point again?
Unilever is bigger than Kraft iirc 
In another article it quotes him basically saying Kraft was lowballing and to fuck off.
Good article about the man and his reasoning, https://www.ft.com/content/5873f618-f6b4-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65
Remember when Warren Buffet loved Wells Fargo ?

>"Wells Fargo is great. It's so profitable. They have a huge consumer base that buys so many products. Wells Fargo is what I call a terrific bank"*

http://www.cnbc.com/id/34953353

Meanwhile people on the ground were forced to sell products to old people. They were harassed by management and ready to kill themselves. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/business/dealbook/lions-hunting-zebras-ex-wells-fargo-bankers-describe-abuses.html?action=click&contentCollection=DealBook&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/business/dealbook/voices-from-wells-fargo-i-thought-i-was-having-a-heart-attack.html

Then the scandal broke out. John Stumpf was replaced.

**That's the new CEO of Wells Fargo :**

>WELLS FARGO’S NEW CEO, Tim Sloan, told a leading industry trade publication in June 2016 that the bank’s aggressive sales culture and “cross-selling” targets was perfectly appropriate and “is not going to change.” This was years after top executives at the bank knew that thousands of their employees were responding to those sales targets by generating fake accounts.

>Sloan is replacing John Stumpf, who stepped down on Wednesday amid the ongoing scandal, for which the company has been fined $185 million by federal regulators and faces investigations from the departments of Justice and Labor.

>Before the fines were announced, Sloan, who was groomed to replace Stumpf for years, sat down with American Banker to talk about the company on June 16. By that point, the Los Angeles Times had already uncovered evidence of fake accounts, and the city attorney of Los Angeles had filed suit over the allegations (the suit would eventually be folded into the larger settlement). The L.A. Times also had disclosed that the bank was under federal investigation.

>American Banker asked Sloan, “Wells has come under scrutiny for its strong sales culture. Is there any sense that the bank has pushed that strategy to the limit?”

>“No,” Sloan replied.

>“the fundamental strategy that we have is not going to change.”

https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/just-four-months-ago-new-wells-fargo-head-said-no-changes-in-sales-strategy/

You know what Buffet just said about him ? He praised him. 

http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/11/14/sloan-gets-warren-buffett-seal-approval-wells-fargo-ceo

Shame ? I don't think he feels any shame.
Kind of but not really. What it's saying is that Kraft sent a purchase proposal to Unilever, wanting to open amicable talks with (what they perceived to be) a fair offer. Unilever's CEO responded with more venom than one would expect out of a rejection, basically saying "Fuck off, your company brings nothing to the table for us." So rather than attempting a hostile takeover, which Warren Buffet is opposed to, Kraft is backing off altogether. 
The CEO would not reject an offer like that without first consulting with the board. So...no
Warren Buffet talks a lot about the importance of honest management respecting the laws and ethics.

You gotta see what his companies actually do.

Journalists from the Center for Public Integrity  published some horrifying investigation :

https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/04/03/17024/warren-buffetts-mobile-home-empire-preys-poor

Warren Buffett famously helped out Goldman Sachs in 2008 in the depths of the global financial crisis. In announcing the move, he called Goldman Sachs an exceptional company with exceptional leadership.

This is a company accused of a criminal conspiracy to rig the international commodity market. This is a company accused of marketing, and selling toxic fraudulent mortgage-backed securities while betting against the same securities it was peddling to its customers.

http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405

Warren Buffet is probably one of the smartest investors ever and he has the best reputation of any billionaire. He has achieved it by using this "aw shucks, anyone can do what I do" persona. And by fooling people that he is just a "sensible, honest" businessman.
 
The truth is that he would cut your throat in a alley with a dirty knife for an 0.1% point on his portfolio.

[deleted]
What??? What happened?
It would make more sense if Unilever took over Kraft, in that case, rather than the other way around. Kraft is significantly smaller. 
Yup, Unilever's market cap is about $34 billion more than Kraft
That doesnt matter with Warren Buffet behind the deal, he wouldnt have any problem paying what kraft offered. What this deal does though is increase the value of unilever since kraft was offering 50 a share, this in turn increases the value of kraft, frankly those industries in general. Good play, especially when unilever responded by saying it wasn't a big enough offer 
I don't think it's bigger than Berkshire Hathaway and the whole Buffett empire. Is it?
So Warren Buffer is *not* opposed to becoming "a global consumer goods giant by buying competitors and cutting costs and jobs to drive profits.", but he's above the whole hostile takeover thing?  What a swell guy.  Very thoughtful of him.
the way you worded sounds a lot less shitty then they way the article was written.
And I'm probably fairly younger than you and I'm pissy over it too.

It's fair to say that everyone likes actual ice cream and not whatever Breyer's is now.

Not really. That's pretty much exactly what the article says.
You'd think they'd make them sign a contract with such promises in them and outs of cadburys if kraft broke said promises. 
TWC is also a massive slut that wants to be had by anyone.

Weird to see a hostile Kellogg story right after briebart declared war on them
Every company that has used a 3rd world nation for cheap labor has used child labor. It really is unavoidable. What people do not understand is that labor portions of agriculture, factory, or warehousing work abroad are NOT owned and managed by our big American companies. They are owned by local companies that specialize in finding the cheap labor in the area and managing them who then pimp them out to whoever will pay them for work. I own a construction company, and I have without a doubt hired an illegal immigrant. I dont want to, I do everything I am required to prevent such a thing, but it still happens. The drywaller I hired to do the drywalling will have someone with forged papers who is working on my job and getting paid under the table. If I all of a sudden become a target of the media or ran for office, a BS article could be written about me saying, "constructor of things uses illegal immigrants even though he is against it, what a douche!" But it is unavoidable. Kelloggs and Nestle would like to not use child labor, and there are things in practice there that prevent child labor usage, not because they give a fuck about the morals, they dont want to be a target of the media. They require the labor providing subcontractors to prove the age of their works, but in a 3rd world country, there isnt exactly pristine methods of proof available. It is all easily forgeable. 
But Kellogg's won't advertise on Breitbart so they're the good guys
How many Chinese laborers committed suicide while making my iPhone?
They'd better.  I'm paying top dollar here!
Nothing to see here go back to you Little Debbie fat cakes.
In the places where this stuff comes from, it seems almost inhumane to *not* hire children, if they/their family is able to earn anything. That's what people do there. They work. That's their livelihood.

We still have child labor right here in America. Picking tobacco of all things. 
Palm Oil - yummy another PUFA to which there's tons of mounting evidence it's contributing to all kinds of disease!

That's the real crime!

Note:   I'm not talking about natural virgin palm oil - but the stuff that's so refined you may as well eat Castrol Syntech; IE the crap these multinational penny pinching profit mongers that don't give two craps about your health use!
Is there anything disgusting nestle isn't involved in?
Is this the first shot in Breitbart's war against Kellogg's?
Is it free range child labor?  I prefer free range steroid lite soy only child labor in the products I use.
Great, now I have to choose between being a neo-nazi and supporting child labor.
Child labor in countries where schooling is rare and families struggle to get by isn't a bad thing. Obviously we want to improve their situation, but banning child labor just gets those kids fired, puts them on the street, and  hurts their families.

You need to improve the country's economy and education to get rid of child labor, not shame US companies into moving their production/supply elsewhere or have the kids fired from their jobs.
Companies should disavow Kellogg's as their sponsor
Not surprised at all that this surfaced only now, after trumpets declared war on Kelloggs. Fragile snowflakes get so easily triggered, I'm just sitting here eating my third bowl of raisin bran
What can find a substitute for this right? Because rain forests are being wiped out because of it. 
> Breitbart declares war on Kellogg's after cereal brand pulls advertising from site: The right-wing news organization is calling for a boycott on Kellogg’s products after company says Breitbart is not ‘aligned with our values’

Well now I don't know whom to believe!
http://imgur.com/a/DQNAt

What r/news looks like right now.
Kelloggs' employees also piss in the cereal. 
They hire 3rd parties to find cheap labor.  So the firms can blame them instead of taking the blame themselves 
And to all you fellas out there, Unilever acquired dollar shave club a couple months ago on the low. Time to turn that Mo'vember into a Decembeard.
This just in water is wet
Unless they're slaves or force to work I don't see any problems with this. If they're not making palm oil then they would be doing something else to feed themselves or their family.
The people that get pissed about this all make there kids do chores. They in essence are using child labor.

Edit: not saying chores are bad, in fact they are good for teaching a work ethic
When corporations are people they end up being bad people.
Yeah, weird that Kellogg suddenly pulls a PR stunt by blocking Brietbart when they know **Amnesty International**, an NGO on human rights, is about to expose  Kellogg for being scumbags. 

Maybe it's some vast right-wing conspiracy to undermine the good folks at Kellogg! /s
If these large multinational corporations actually wanted to pay their laborers fairly and source their labor ethically, they would figure out a way to do it. They just don't care.
Exactly.

People get outraged about this, but fail to look at their own hands.

If you own an electronic device, you personally **YES YOU** likely support evil dictatorial regimes that use profits from the mining of Coltan to fund their oppressive regimes and campaigns of ethnic cleansing.

"I didn't know" **isn't an excuse**. There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of reports on this.

"I can't check the supplier of my products" **isn't an excuse**. The ability to check if a manufacturer has taken steps to only use conflict-free components is a finger-tap or mouse-click away.

The use of revenue from mining operations by terrible regimes is common, public, knowledge to all but those who live in willful ignorance.

Every single human being on planet earth with an electronic device capable of connecting to the Internet knows this, or at least they should unless they are so uninformed that their opinion should be dismissed as irrelevant due to ignorance of the world around them.

Unless you are a piece-of-shit hypocrite the only solution is to immediately dispose of all of your ill-gotten gains, and only purchase products from suppliers who can guarantee that the tantalum capacitors and other electronic components used in their devices are made from materials that are not sourced from areas where oppressive regimes control ore extraction.

[The list of manufacturers who certify that their products are "blood ore" free is very short.](http://www.enoughproject.org/files/publications/corporate_action_fact_sheet-1.pdf)

Are people who own an electronic device made by a company not on the list of manufacturers who have an auditing system in place more, equally, or less guilty than Kellogg's?

Your cellphone may have but the cheap-ass no-name charger or battery pack you bought probably has a capacitor in it that funded a child soldier. *"Oh but I only killed like 1/1000th of a person..."*
I understand your context but how many times have you accidentally hired an 8 year old to do drywalling or concrete mixing because he just so happened to have a good fake ID? I mean, being 4'2" and unable to grow facial hair is pretty normal for construction, right?
Remember to choose the corporate overlord that's nicest to your own people!
Kellogg pulled their advertising since they support Black Lives Matter, donating $900,000 to a group Breitbart considers a domestic terrorist group.  
There's an app for that
Ask Siri. 
Just so you know, Foxconn isn't just Apple, they make products for Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, Nokia, Amazon, Acer, Google, Dell, Cisco, Intel, HP, etc.
"The places where this stuff comes from" are that way because of western imperialism and capitalism.
>In the places where this stuff comes from, it seems almost inhumane to not hire children,

Dude, I totally get you, here is a [relaxing video](https://youtu.be/mb19scAqzcw?t=25) that explains the real truth about child labour laws to everyone and tells how they can help!
I'm pretty sure that the people who run Nestle are the closest thing reality has to actual supervillains. 
No, Kellogg used Brietbart as a preemptive strike to distract from the fact they use child labor. If you read the article, you'd know Amnesty International broke the story and I can guarantee they don't like Brietbart. 
You can bet your ass! Expect more to come
Pretty sure they're factory farmed.  You ever try and catch free-range children?  It's like herding cats.
[Disliking both](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-03/26/19/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-25942-1427414324-7.jpg) is the third option.

If companies disavow every group that has child labor in third world countries, companies will soon find it harder to find a sponsor than it is to find Nessy
*What?*

Breitbart made Kelloggs support child labor because their advertising was pulled?
I think it's worse that they're/we're driving demand and refuse to see that people are being exploited for our money. 
Good to know, thanks for the perspective 
About to? Child labor isn't recent news.
They are paying for the raw material. They literally go to a vendor of sorts and say "hey I need 100 tons of this raw material" and then another local company sells it to them. That local company buys it from abunch of smaller groups and family farms. Somewhere in the mix are kids working, now you can loosely state that the US company is using kids to pick their raw materials. You could use the same logic to say that /u/Punxsatownyphil hired children to make him a laptop. Punxsatownyphil hired Sony to provide him with a laptop. Sony then contracted a computer chip company to provide a unique chip to this computer. That chip manufacturer then contracted out the raw materials to a resource supplier. That supplier contracted out the labor to local groups who have some kids mining Palladium out of a mine in South Africa. Fuck you /u/PunxsatownyPhil you sweat shoppin mother fucker. 
So child labor is all our fault since we buy goods and since "every company does it" we should just be ok with it? I mean, articles pointing it out and shedding light on the companies involved is surely a good thing to come to some sort of fix for the problem, right? But instead you want to just shame everyone like we have an actual hand in the child labor going on. 
Damn, HP did something right for once 

Also who the fuck used thantalium resistors anymore?
They force us to buy these products, because yes we are forced since it is impossible to live in this country without having to utilise electronic devices and it is pretty much illegal to live off the land permanently anywhere then you turn around and BLAME US for this issue?

Go fucking fuck yourself, you piece of fucking shit.
Its not the same business, there they contract sums out. like I need "100 tons of cocoa beans, who can provide this amount for the cheapest" They send it out to bid, and some various local companies say they can gather that amount up from buying it from a whole bunch of small family farms for 300k USD. Nestle gives them the contract. This company then goes out and buys cocoa beans from family farms through their own sub contracts. Most of those farms use their kids for extra labor. Boom now you have a story that you stamp a title of "Nestle uses kids to harvest cocoa beans" simply to hurt them economically.  
Great comment. Very subtle. Who gives a fuck what fucking Breitbart thinks?

Name any group and I promise you some other group considers them terrorists. Unless it's something like ultranationalist militias, where it's much, much easier to find people that recognize them for the pieces of shit that they are.
Probably more climate related actually, because some things only really grow in certain places, and if they weren't getting paid for something that grows only there, they wouldn't be part of the world economy at all. 
They seem to be doing a great job too. 

There's about 100+ people in the comment section of the 'Kelloggs pulling advertising from Breitbart' post who are giddy and promising to buy Kelloggs everything because Kelloggs stopped advertising on a website with different political views than the people commenting. Also plenty of folks posting the contact info for Kelloggs and encouraging people on "their side" to write Kelloggs and tell them how great they are for pulling ads from a website they don't agree with and don't read anyway.

This division between the "left" and the "right" is honestly making everyone fucking insane. I've *never* in my life seen so many "liberals" happy with censorship and angry at transparency just because it's for or against their "side", and I've been very left leaning my entire life.

I wish everyone on *both* "sides" would take a step back and look at what's actually fucking happening to **all of us**.
No, you have a list of suppliers and you are suppose to audit them. otherwise how do you insure basic quality and safety. or is it ok for a company whose supplier cut the milk with melamine to disclaim all responsibility ?
[deleted]
I think it's important to recognize how the demand we create contributes to the system.
That really could have helped us with the whole War on Drugs thing. 
It's too available. It's hard to resist.
True, true. How can Nestlé possible ever know? It's not like they are international mega corporation who can afford to hire [people to keep an eye on their supply chain](http://www.nestle.com/csv/rural-development-responsible-sourcing/responsible-sourcing) to ensure ethical labor practices. That would be insane.
The commercial oil palm is actually native to Africa. They're being grown in Indonesia because it's currently easier to exploit Indonesians and their land (rainforest clear-cutting). Many of the workers are brought from the Philippines and the business owners are not Indonesians either. This is not helping Indonesia. I'm not sure why Indonesia needs to "be part of the world economy" anyway.
The problem is the number of cups in the stack. A certain ethical clothing company (can't remember which) recently announced they switched their cotton supplier because after many years they finally discovered the company that sold material to the company that sold the material to theor supplier bought from a local company that used child labor.

It should absolutely be done, we should make sure these things aren't happening, but I won't sit here like an ignoramus and pretend it's an easy job
Multinationals don't respond to boycotts.

They just open another shell company and sell their product under a different name until people either forget the boycott or catch on. The multinational Capitalists have already Innovated their way around the threat of the "informed consumer."
My clothing got a lot more expensive when I started triple checking the supply chain on what I wear, but at least when I put my pants on in the morning I have a leg to stand on when I call people out on supporting modern slavery.
The united states has an unlimited amount of money. It is a billion nestles. The US cannot even scratch the surface of the illegal immigrant labor force. They have cameras on every corner of this place, they have armed guards paroling the street. They have everything at their will, and they even force the employers into taking costly measures into their own hands. So how the fuck do you expect a fucking chocolate milk company to be able to prevent any illegally working individuals from having business dealings with them when they do business with hundreds on millions of people in multiple 3rd world countries spread out all over the world? YOU CANT
The business owners are often Indonesian, they're just not ethnically Indonesian. Chinese Indonesians have been living in Indonesia and near the top of the economic chart there for a long time. 

(They also tend to get killed because they're "the rich Jews" to a minority of Indonesians minds. Straight up 1934 Germany style.)
They have a population of over 200 million. Of course they should be a part of the world economy if they want to.
So you spend more on clothing so you can talk down to those who dont or cant afford to? I'm confused by this logic, it seems you are doing it to feel self righteous and shame others rather than to stop child labor/slavery
Yes, but child labor still isn't black and white. A lot of families rely on having children who can work to help bring in money to survive. 

So if you start boycotting and manufacturers begin canceling contracts with companies who have child labor, how will these families survive?

It's a lot tougher than it seems.
Gee, I dunno. You'd think if random reporters can easily find this stuff a mult-billion dollar corporation who has an entire department dedicated to uncovering it would be able to see if small children were laboring out in the open sun. But hey, maybe Nestlé decided to fill that department with blind people so they can tell us all about how they care by hiring the disabled.
Do you think exploitation of their children and workers by multinationals is a good way to do that?
Gee you'd think the United states of america could keep an illegal immigrant and wanted felon off of job site, yet i could walk down the street and find one in 15min. Fuck off.
I guess so, it seems to work and has worked for the USA. 
We aren't talking about immigrants or the USA. This is specifically regarding child labor in Indonesia and big companies like Nestlé. Did you even read the article?
Laws aren't going to stop Capitalists from maximizing their profit at every level of business. The incentive for profit is simply too great to ignore.
Without the incentive for profit, we would still be in the stone age. 
Well, Vegemite is now back in Australian hands, so all is right with the world.
Pretty sure Unilever told them to piss off.
mite is right eh?
This. From what the news is reporting, Unilever didn't even show up to the negotiation table. I'm sure Kraft is doing a lot via the news media to harbor its stock prices after they got shaken up, though.
This is the same firm that did the Burger King and Tim Hortons acquisition and inversion to Canada.  
This kind of company scares me as they just fucking want to acquire profitable business to grow their money. Some will buy a brand then kill it because it is no longer profitable under them or because they have same product under different brand...
I believe so. I think they are Brazilian based. 
They are sucking peoples blood.
Fuck them. Duke's is the best mayo.
What was that about a free market?  
Its really fucking good. That's why they are freaking out. PLOT TWIST: Hellmann's Mayonnaise founder Warren Hellmann started and postmortem pays for Hardly Strictly Bluegrass music festival in SF which is attended by 300,000 vegans...

I think Unilever is just pissed they didn't think of this.  After all, they invented "Frozen Dairy Dessert" in place of ice cream.  Of course, that stuff is disgusting.  

I think this is what makes this seem so ironic to me.  Most people buy Unilever/Breyer's "Frozen Dairy Dessert" thinking it is "ice cream" and find out that it's gross.  In this case however, people are buying "Mayo" and finding out that it is much _better_ than Hellmann's "Mayonaisse."   
...maybe they should have called it "Not Mayo" instead of "Just Mayo."

Holy shit they have Sriracha mayo.

FUCK YOU HELLMANN'S.
I Can't Believe It's Not Mayo!^®
Whoever wins, as long as miracle whip is on the shelf, we all loose.
This could have heavy implications for Velveeta.
They should rename it “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Mayo!”.  Fuck Unilever.
Whataburger's mayo is three times the mayo Hellmann's mayo will ever be. I'm bitter..
Yes! Duke's is THE ONLY REAL mayonnaise. All others suck ass.
Never had Duke's but you should really try Just Mayo... I was always iffy about mayo, but now I eat that shit way more than I should...
Everyone loves a free market until the public doesn't want your product anymore.
I make a similar product I call "That's Not Mayo!"
"Just Mayo" *is* definitely false advertising for something that has no eggs in it. And their "plant in front of egg" logo does nothing to alleviate the confusion.
Um, that's why they use the term "mayo". BTW, some Unilever products also don’t meet the requirements to be marketed as mayonnaise. Read the article.
If I saw a product labeled "Just OJ," I'd expect it to be 100% orange juice, not apple juice with some citrus and pulp blended in. Similarly, if I saw a product labeled "Just Mayo," I'd expect it to be mayonnaise, not some other whipped topping product. I do think it's funny that Unilever had to go back and re-label their own products; talk about having, well, egg on their face. Both companies were in the wrong if you ask me.
I did read the article.  "Mayo" is short for "mayonnaise".  No reasonable consumer would think that the shortening of "mayonnaise" to "mayo" was supposed to indicate that it wasn't *real* mayo with *real* eggs in it.  The fact that Unilever was also being deceptive doesn't mean that the company that made and marketed "Just Mayo" wasn't being deceptive.
It's not like you expect mayo to be 100% egg, most 'reasonable customers' expect something that has the taste an texture of what people know as mayo, and either understand that it's a good thing that it doesn't have egg, or don't care. 

Egg is just the traditional way of achieving that texture, and at the time the FDA definition was written, there was little awareness of the reasons to replace eggs.
Just so happens, if you want to be pedantic about it- which this is all this comes down to really- Hellman's doesn't fit the FDA's definition of mayonnaise...
>[At first glance, I note at least two reasons that Hellman's mayonnaise may itself not meet the FDA's standard of identity for mayonnaise. First, Hellman's mayonnaise contains added water, which is not itself a permissible ingredient under the FDA's standard of identity for mayonnaise. (Diluting vinegar and/or citric acid with water is permissible under the standard of identity, but there's no mention of adding water to the mayonnaise mix itself.) Second, Hellman's mayonnaise contains soybean oil. The FDA's standard of identity for mayonnaise states that mayonnaise must contain vegetable oil. Soybeans are legumes, not vegetables. Is it possible then that—at least according to the FDA's definition—Hellman's is not mayonnaise? Meanwhile, rather unhelpfully, the FDA refers in its regulations designating the proper name of food ingredients to the following example: "hydrogenated vegetable oil (soybean, cottonseed, and palm oils)[.]" But neither soybeans, cotton, nor palm are vegetables. Is it possible then, too, that FDA regulations pertaining to proper names which misidentify a legume, a shrub, and a tree as vegetables may be worth tossing in the rubbish?](http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/22/hellmans-says-mayo-nays-sues-competitor)
>Unilever said Thursday that it decided to withdraw the lawsuit so that Hampton Creek can address its label directly with industry groups and regulatory authorities.

This is about a lawsuit by a behemoth against its small-time startup competitor. Maybe you should provide us with your definition of "reasonable consumer" because I define that as someone who reads labels before they buy something. As for FDA regulations, I would never have believed that I was ingesting [dried beaver castor sacs](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/01/beaver-butts-emit-goo-used-for-vanilla-flavoring/) when eating food products with "natural raspberry flavoring".
Really a name is important.  We shouldn't allow ersatz foods to label themselves as genuine.  
Whether there's a "good guy-bad guy" dynamic at play here or not, *it's not OK for someone to call their product "Just Mayo", implying simplicity and a return to the original recipe of mayo, without things like artificial sweeteners or preservatives,* ***when they're not selling fucking mayonnaise***.

e: The FDA tells you that castoreum is safe to consume, not that it's not "gross".

It looks like mayo, tastes like mayo, has the texture of Mayo. In blind tests nobody would call it anything other than Mayo, so as far as I'm concerned the definition is outdated and insisting on calling it something else is just being difficult.
My point was that the FDA allows calling an ingredient something it isn't- but tastes like what they name it. Same here, mayonnaise is not something where you would recognize there's egg in it or not. It's used as a spread with a certain taste and texture. That's what defines mayonnaise's properties. There is nothing unsafe in Just Mayo- but because it mimics mayonnaise in texture, taste and use, for all intents and purposes- as long as it contain safe ingredients- it's basically the same thing.
They could change the definition of mayo then.  To me mayo is oil and egg.
Sadly I was hoping Unilever would prevail in this.  Our labeling laws suck, leading to products that are basically fraud in a jar.
This isnt just a Unilever concern, it effects the whole industry.

I dont understand the pushback, this kind of labelling laws are very common. This is why velveeta is not a cheese.
Another example of America's love of the victim. Here Hampton Creek was producing a product that would normally not be called mayonnaise, but for our new found love of alternative foods we found ourselves rooting for this under dog. 

We have always expected egg in our mayonnaise when did we accept substitutes. It may be better but then we call it a spread. 
Regardless of this lawsuit, you should try Just Mayo. Their stuff is awesome.
For Tesco to pull all Unilever products from it's online store and shelves is either going to make Brexit or kill Tesco, surely?

The UK shopper loves a brand.
Seeing a lot of misinformation and conjecture in this thread about the reason for arrests and how protests in general are handled in DC, so I wanted to clear some things up.

I worked for a video crew filming the protests on both Sunday and Monday.  The Democracy Awakening event has been going on for the past week, and other than Sunday they have marched a group every day to the steps of the US Capitol building (East side) and were voluntarily arrested.

Just yesterday alone, around 300 people were arrested.  They were not blocking "heavy pedestrian throughways" as one comment suggested either, these protests have been planned and even coordinated with the police (yes, they do that in DC), so they were already prepared and ready to process people onsite.  In fact, nobody is even placed in handcuffs.  The protest is civil, and as such people were placed into small groups and escorted over to a police trailer that processed them and ticketed them for a $50 processing fee, and then they are sent on their way.

As to the march, there is a division of the DC Police (DC Mobile Unit) that interfaces with the protest planners so that the roads are officially blocked off at the route points by police escorts.  

Afterwards we were fortunate enough to interview both Ben and Jerry before they went out to lunch for fried chicken.  
"Arrested for protesting the money in politics." 
Man, that's wonderful. We all know its a problem but when business people get involved, it seems to matter that much more. Hopefully this isn't a one-off thing for them
People need to say Washington DC when talking about something that happens at the capitol, there is a whole state that is called Washington on the complete other side of the country ya know...
loving that thumbnail. they sure have aged...strangely.
Maybe this is just my bias but when I first clicked on this headline I thought Ben and Jerry were arrested for a "real" crime. It's a bit of a misleading title imo. Good for them for standing up for us old regular citizens! 
Zebra stripe ripple, next new flavor, you heard it here!
Ben and Jerry announce a new flavor "Civil Disobedience" 
I met Jerry at a local scoop shop. The man was just full of life. When I went in to shake his hand he looked at me and just gave me a hug. And it wasn't some short quick fake hug. The man practically lifted me off my feet. 

The both of them are just jolly fellows who only want happiness in the world.

>U.S. Capitol Police say those arrested were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, which is unlawful demonstration activity. They were processed on the scene and released.

I guess we don't need to pay attention to that bit in the constitution about 'the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances'

Just the other day there was this nasty antisemitic gif with loads of upvotes in r/gifs and I was so disheartened to think that in general, my fellow redditors thought of Jews according to the stereotype of "only interested in money." But then, today, there's a much more prominent post about two Jews protesting against money in politics, money as influence, and it's massively upvoted and no one in the comments is making nasty remarks about guys named Cohen and Greenfield.

This should be at the top. DC knows how to do and handle protests.
Democracy Awakening has only been happening for a couple days and is already over. Before that was their associated group of which I was a member, called Democracy Spring. 150 of us walked from Philadelphia to DC over 10 days leading up to it, then on April 11, 430 of us were arrested. People were arrested every day following, and then Awakening joined us on Saturday.
Why are people being arrested in the first place? What about freedom of speech and assembly?
Democracy Spring*
Ben and Jerry have been personally fighting the Citizens United ruling since it was passed in 2010. They created an organization called Free Speech for People I think, and they've been promoting regular activism ever since. This is refreshing to see-- they're still on the warpath.
> We all know its a problem but when business people get involved, it seems to matter that much more. Hopefully this isn't a one-off thing for them

The are both still board members, but neither has had any real authority in the B&J company since 2000. They're pretty much just political activists now.
Would have been cool if he brought a bunch of half banked to hand out to everyone while protesting. He probably wouldnt have been arrested then.


Edit: I originally ment half baked but now I'm sticking with it haha. 
I get your point but they were arrested for protesting, they're being arrested for where they were protesting, which is and has never been allowed.

For exmaple, I could protest pooping on Sundays and if I protested at the Capitol I'd be arrested.  I could then go on Reddit and say "Arrested for protesting pooping on Sunday, what a time to be alive.". 
If they were really an obstruction, it makes sense to arrest them. The protestors won't go to prison, and they'll wear their arrests as badges of honor.
They've been supportive of getting money out of politics for years already.

I was really confused on why he was arrested here in the state... oh... of course, the Capital.

Edit: apparently the city of DC is a Capital and the building is the Capitol. Thanks English. 
I thought DC stands for Da Capitol 
You actually don't even need to put "Washington".  Just fucking put "DC".  I was even confused at first and the only reason I clicked on it was because I thought they were arrested for something else in Washington state.

I already knew these guys were pretty much advocates for change so seeing a headline that they were arrested in "DC" probably wouldn't have even warranted the click for me personally.
Wait, you mean this wasn't in Washington County, PA?
If you're from the Northwest, it's Washington DC and Washington.  In the rest of the country, it's apparently Washington and Washington State.
Seriously, I was wondering what they were even doing here in the Evergreen state, and how they possibly managed to get arrested.  Title should have been:
>Ben and Jerry Arrested While Protesting at Capitol

Edit: Can't spell.
I get the feeling a lot of people forget that there's a Washington state. Or assume that if you mean the state, you'll say Washington State.

Which is ridiculous, really.

I read the article, and still thought it was the state. Doh. 
Right why not fucking say dc? Clearly saying Washington caused confusion so why not call Washington, D.C. Fucking dc. Confusion diverted. I can't have been the only person to realize this?
What's worse, Washington is actually the name they gave the state because their [first choice would be confused with DC](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/02/how_did_washington_state_and_washington_d_c_get_the_same_name_.html).
Also... not the only Washington city in the country. Washington is the city. You'd be better off just saying "D.C."
Half of reddit posts don't specify this, making many stories very confusing and seemingly unrealistic
On the flip side. When I say I'm from Washington, i m always asked if DC.

So annoying. Especially considering 90% of DC is not my demographic
Right why not fucking say dc? Clearly saying Washington caused confusion so why not call Washington, D.C. Fucking dc. Confusion diverted. I can't have been the only person to realize this?
Pretty sure that's the mother in Everybody Loves Raymond, and she died today actually. Maybe since that's the news the thumbnail got chosen somehow.
Not to mention they were released on scene. Which basically means a cop cuffed them and then let them go shortly after. Hardly the same thing as being arrested and processed/charged, which is what most people would assume given the lack of context.
They would get 10% of the clicks if they said "Ben and Jerry momentarily detained and processed for protesting in DC"
I was fully prepared for a Jared Fogle scenario

If they included that bit, you might side with them. Can't have that.
Against money in politics.

I was out there this weekend when they were arresting people. The police had setup a designated protesting area that was off to the side. The police gave the protesters warnings to move or they would be arrested, then unsurprisingly they started arresting protesters who didn't move. 

The cop said they had already arrested a bunch of people, and this current group was another wave that showed up since the last arrests. 
That doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're carrying a picket sign. You can't impede the business of governing a fucking country and expect to get away without being arrested.

The Capitol Police are very very accommodating to whichever variety of crazy person decides to show up on the Hill on any given day, but when you seek to physically prevent lawmakers from making laws, and don't respond to multiple warnings that you'll be arrested, you get arrested.

The Supreme Court is literally across the street. They are the authority on the Constitution, not you. They disagree with you.
Jailhouse Blues...?

Blueberry sorbet with little chocolate files in it?
So they were basically handed a $50 protesting tax?
Charging 50 dollars for people to not even protest is fucking brilliant. 

Most amazing social engineering feat I've ever seen. They litterally controlled the protest before it even happened, and just had the protestors stand in line to pay the government they're protesting 50 dollars each. Completely invalidated the entire purpose and effect of a stand-in by making the protestors tell them about it before hand so they could take the appropriate counter-measures so nothing would be disrupted.

WOW. They made 15,000 dollars. That was the net impact of the protest against money in politics. Politics made 15k. The guy who did this deserves some kind of prize or recognition.

>DC knows how to do and handle prostitutes.

Still true.
Really? I feel like the protest is pretty pointless if people just get a fine and go on with their day.

Who cares?
I was really confused by how much press DA got. I followed your group on Friday in Baltimore, then was there all last week, and we were one of the only members of the press there that wasn't independent. Then, DA joins and people talk about it.
I believe they were trying to get arrested. 
Freedom of assembly isn't "freedom to assemble anywhere"- you can protest in tons of places in DC, just not on the Capitol steps.

Protesters knew this and did it on purpose specifically so they'd be arrested.
I didn't know that! Good. Next time I can, I'm gonna buy a big ol' pint of their ice cream and go to town, just to support them.
I hope Free Speech for People doesn't accept any corporate sponsorship.
Well I really don't think it is fair that they can use their wealth to make a political organization pushing their pet project.  Talk about crowding out the voices of the little guy.  One person, one vote!  /s
Isn't it completely hypocritical to be against CU, but then sell ice cream named after the Presidential candidate you support?

Remember what CU was really about...  A small company formed and made a film critical of Hillary Clinton, and she sued to stop it from being shown. It got to the Supreme Court, who ruled the movie could go forward.

Why do Ben & Jerry think companies shouldn't be able to make films critical of candidates, but should be able to sell ice cream named after and in support of candidates?

Can't think of why it's not incredibly hypocritical of them.
So they created a group to organize and express themselves to the government?  I wonder how much money that took?

edit: The organization is called [Free Speech for People](http://freespeechforpeople.org/) and they actually have a link where you can donate to support their cause.  Isn't this exactly what they are fighting against; getting money out of politics?  It seems a little weird that the organization is raising money in order to advertise their mission, hire lawyers to support their goals, and petition the government with the explicit goal of making organizations just like their organization illegal. 

Why do they have the right to pool money from supporters in order to express themselves but no one else should?  What a joke
That's not how board members work.  The board has the power to determine the officers of the company, which is the ultimate power.  They may have limited day-to-day activity in the company but essentially run the company by choosing who the officers are.
They would have nailed them for distributing food without the proper permits.

Sure, it's fair that they were "arrested".  But it's so minor an infraction as to be beneath even a speeding ticket.  Who gives a shit.   
   
  

The point of the protest was to get arrested, and raise awareness. Civil disobedience. 
Well,  requiring government permission to protest the government seems silly. 
And this arrest actually helps them.  No one pays attention if Ben and Jerry go and walk around in DC.  But if they get arrested, that makes the news and draws attention to their cause. They likely intended to be arrested - it's a common protest tactic.
I live in NoVA, and I usually use DC too. Sometimes I'll call it Washington if it's clear that I'm talking about Washington, DC.
I'm from Montgomery County, MD and everyone I know around here says DC. 
I feel like Washington is the formal name you use for when you're mad at it, much like when your parent uses your full, formal name to scold you. Like, I'm going *to visit* DC, but I'm going to MARCH ON Washington. 
Well I'm not from the US and I'm pretty sure people around the world call the city Washington rather than DC. I didn't even know what DC stood for until I was like 20.  
  
People are more surprised that the state exists and has nothing to do with the city than the other way around.

The first time I spent any significant time on the east coast was in grad school, and people would always introduce me (at meet and greets) as being from "Washington State." That's the name of a university here, so I would forget myself and correct them: "No, it's the University of Washington (my alma mater)." I would get blank stares and people would say they meant the state, not the school. I'd get all sheepish and be like, ^("Oh... we just call it Washington.") Life is tough.
Seattle has a Capitol Hill too, which makes it even more confusing.
For the first 10 years of my life I thought the capital was "DC", a city, in the state of Washington.  I live in NYC and always thought it was stupid to put our capital so far away.
I just though it was the state because why wouldn't they want to be in Washington?

They were in the city, not the building.

"Washington? So you're from the East Coast?"

"No. Washington state. If I meant DC I would have said DC."

"Oh! You mean the place Twilight is from!"
No, it's Washington Township in Montgomery County, Ohio! I'm driving around but I can't find any demonstrators, though. Maybe the arrested ALL of them??
Or 29 other states (plus Washington Parish in Louisiana), or the former county in South Dakota 
Wait you mean this isn't in Washington, OK?
I live in the northeast and I pretty much only refer to it as "DC."

But it is worth noting that all their sports teams (Redskins, Nationals, Capitals, Wizards) are "Washington," not "Washington, DC" or "DC."

Holy fuck, I've spent so long reading about the semantics of state and city naming conventions that I totally forgot I came here to read about Ben & Jerry getting arrested. What did they do that put them behind ~~ice~~ ~~cream~~ bars?
The article title was perfect for the Reddit title. Not sure why the fucktard changed it...

>Co-founders of Ben & Jerry's arrested at US Capitol
Seriously - I feel like Ben & Jerry would have a really hard time getting arrested in Washington. 


Eh, i agree. if you google "Washington" the state comes up over anything. And google is the all knowing ruler of everything and all, so it obviously should be what people think when they say Washington, NOT DC.
Can confirm. Most people ask me to specify dc or state here in California. 
Outside the US, they forget about WA, I know. It blew our exchange students' minds when we told them there was a district called Washington DC, which wasn't a state, and a state called Washington, which didn't run the country. In their home countries, they always called it Washington. This was told to me by Mexican, Brasilian, Russian, and German exchange students, anyway.
New York often goes the same way.
Wait -- there are five boroughs? I always thought New York meant that island between the Hudson and the Harlem/East River.

**Edit** Yes people, I know there are five boroughs. The joke is that in and around NYC, folks often use "New York" or "the City" to explicitly refer to Manhattan. 
Dc is its own little thing on the east coast between maryland and virginia. 
In between Virginia and Maryland. 
TIL: ohio was almost called washington state before washington state or DC even existed...
I find it easier to just say Seattle when travelling abroad.
This is all part of a mass protrest that's been going on since Friday I believe. The arrests are planned (well, expected) Organizers have told protestors to bring $50 to pay for the arrest-fee (probably not the right term, but) Over 500 people have been arrested at the protest this weekend. Ben and Jerry being arrested was a planned attempt at bringing the protest and issues into the MSM right now, and it worked.


The article says they didn't even cuff the protesters.  At best, the article's title should say they were "fined."  They were not "arrested," by any definition I'm familiar with.
Actually, this could be a third class misdemeanor, which they wouldn't take them in for.
And OP wouldn't have the karma to feed his starving family

As somebody mentions below, yeah they created a flavour for Bernie.  I wonder if they sold the name or making Unilever pay licensing?
Their involvement is minimal, but they do have some input at times (minor decisions a few times a year). 

However, B&Js operates autonomously within Unilever. They have their own board of directors and are usually able to operate in complete opposition to Unilever. It was something that was negotiated in the buyout.
They sold it to a soap company?
Ugh. My boss worked there as a chemical engineer for a while. The amount of streams that cross at a food processing plant like that are insane. As are the amount of products from "competing" brands being manufactured on the same lines.

You guys understand getting arrested is part of the plan right? Protests don't get much publicity unless people are getting arrested or there is violence. This is money in politics everyone cares but no one feels they can do anything about it and the news doesn't want to cover it at all. They are deliberately getting arrested trying to make a statement and get headlines. Why else would they get people with name recognition to get themselves arrested.  
Please protest in designated Constitution zone.
"Ben and Jerry arrested and charged with clogging central arteries"
A few years ago a lady rammed her car into several of the car bomb barriers around downtown DC and was eventually shot by Capitol police. A few weeks later a guy set himself on fire within sight of the Capitol steps. There have been anthrax scares, an active shooter at the Navy Yard and a dozen other major incidents in and around the Capitol building in the last decade. The Capitol police need to be able to rapidly evacuate a large, controlled access building that contains both congressional leaders and members of the public. They need to be able to maintain security while keeping the building and its occupants safe in the event of an evacuation. That's really all they're focused on. They never bother protesters 

Protests happen literally every day in DC. I've personally seen Neo-Nazis protesting just a few hundred yards from a large Native American protest. Neither group seemed aware of the other's presence. Both were protesting against Congress. There are often multiple groups protesting at any given day. The Capitol police do not care. Stay away from fire exits and you can do what you want. Usually the large protests tend to line up with the weather getting nice. The cherry blossoms just bloomed so I imagine everyone felt like it was super important to protest money in government right this second. The first protestors were arrested before congress was even in session. No congressmen were present in the city. At least Ben and Jerry actually came on a day congress was there. 

Just note that "arrested" is a strong way of saying that they were forcibly led away from a fire exit before being immediately released.  They did not go to jail. No one bailed them out. They were given a slap on the wrist and asked to take their protests away from the fire exits. 
i read in the initial threads since this started happening it was something like "you can literally protest anywhere else but at this, this, and this location but these idiots are deciding to be idiots" and what not, something about national monuments? i dont remember...dont really care
>That doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're carrying a picket sign. You can't impede the business of governing a fucking country and expect to get away without being arrested.

They do expect to be arrested. This is civil disobedience 101.
Folsome Fudge?
Cuz you know. It's not like there's any kind of constitution with the right to peacefully assemble or anything
There's a right to bear arms but states can still change a permitting fee.
Yes, exactly.

When lots of people gather for a protest the people who live and work where the protest is happening are disrupted. This is the idea though! No one wants to protest in an empty lot, far enough away from anything or anyone important so as not to disrupt. This disruption inconveniences people, though - prevents them from getting to where they're going. So if a protest gets inconvenient, the cops fine, and move, the people causing the inconvenience. This allows convenient protests to go off with no cost, and provides a slight disincentive to inconvenient protests. Not so much that no one will ever protest again, but enough so that if you want to have a big, inconvenient protest, you _really have to want it_.
DC doesn't care about $15,000. By the time you factor in the cost of the cops and the time to process payment and all the administrative BS, they really don't care about $15,000.

I live in DC, just a few blocks from the Capitol. The place where they're being "arrested" is not public space and does, in fact, block entry into the building for legitimate business. Which is why they aren't "arrested" until they start going up the steps.
Correct me if i'm wrong, but from some of the other stuff i've seen about it, the people doing this protest seemed to almost want to be arrested, i'm guessing so they could draw attention to the injustice going on here. 

As a result, why would they agree to pay the processing fee and then simply get sent on their way? It doesn't make sense to me. Doesn't that sort of defeat the entire purpose of their protest?
and page boys
And cocaine
Doug Stamper, is that you?
It makes them feel validated. The city gets $50. Everyone wins.
It's so funny being involved with protests and then going on to Reddit where nobody understands how a protest works.  

I was involved in an HB2 protest in NC and one of the organizers told me "Yeah, I'm going to get arrested"  with a big smile on their face.

Unfortunately, people getting arrested is the only way the media pays attention to important issues in this country.  Hell, this is #1 on /r/all so it worked here too.
So they protested the role of money in politics by paying $50 each to the police?

I'll have to remember that: Next time I want to take a stand against a company/organisation, pay them! If I want Apple to know how much I dislike the iPad, I'll buy 3 of them!
Didn't they sell the company a while back?

Edit: And if I scrolled down six comments, I'd see that yes, they did.
Ugh, I'm trying to diet for the summer but this is making it hard.  Those damn Chunky Monkey's have cocaine laced in them...
they sold the ice cream company years ago
Ben & Jerry's is a corporation...
You made me think about this one for a while.

After doing some digging: [He doesn't consider it hypocritical because he did the icecream as an individual and not through his corporation.](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ben-jerrys-cofounder-unveils-bernie-sanders-themed-ice-cream)

He, as far as I can tell, isn't selling the ice cream either. The affiliated website sells "Bernie" support election signs, and offers a contest to win the home made icecream.

It's a little weird, but they're using Ben and Jerry as their names. They're quite clear it's not meant to be affiliated with the company:

>This site is owned by me, Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s. It is not associated with Ben and Jerry’s Homemade, Inc or the Sanders for President Campaign. It reflects my views alone.

http://www.berniesyearning.com/

As far as I can tell, this isn't hypocritical of the CU case due to how it was done. The media is the one associating it with their company, and it got all the publicity as a result of bored journalists looking for a story to write about as far as I can tell.
Most people don't actually know what the case was about.
That organization is exactly what it is protesting against...this boggles my mind.
"You're under arrest-- for exceeding limits of deliciousness!" 
It would probably have to contain mint.
There are places in DC that have protests every day of the year.  They chose a location that is not available because it's in other people's way.  This was done deliberately to get the arrests.  This is all standard operating procedure for DC, when people want to be arrested.
It's not THAT they are protesting, it's that they are deliberately blocking the entrance/exit to the Capitol building so that they will be arrested. The cops are being very polite and letting people do it in waves, a group of people comes in, blocks the entrance, the Capitol police give the warning, then they walk up the steps and arrest everyone who stays because they WANT to be arrested, then the next wave comes in, lather rinse repeat.

The people throwing outrage and saying "you can't protest the government without permission!!" don't understand that these kinds of protests are specifically designed to have people arrested for doing some of the very few things you are not allowed to do anywhere so they can get media coverage. You can't block the exit to a building, it's just a safety thing. They are blocking the exit to the Capitol building, they get a standard warning, then everyone is taken in and the next wave walks up to do the same thing.
The government just wants to keep some order by keeping areas free from protestor obstruction. They're not saying you can't protest, they're just saying that they don't want you doing it where it's going to affect the people that don't care about your cause.
You missed my point - it doesn't matter _what_ is being protested if it's not legal to be in the protest location.  You don't get a "protest pass" if you jump over the White House fence and hold a protest sign.   Similarly, BLM didn't get a pass when they impeded traffic.  
I'm Singaporean. To protest here, you apply for a permit, and book a time slot for your protest event at the official protest spot. 
Controversy is the only thing that draws attention today. That's why I've been encouraging Kellogg's to finally post those Tony the Tiger nudes.
I live down in Fredericksburg and I like to call it The Capitol so I can pretend like I live in Panem.
Are you just abbreviating North Virginia or do you actually call it NoVA in regular conversation?
I'm in central VA and we use Washington/DC interchangeably, though it's usually DC. Everyone I know calls the west coast one "Washington state"!
Frederick County here, everyone calls it DC. The only people who call it Washington are tourists or talking exclusively  about congress.
I used to live in Seattle, Washington. There were plenty of people who refused to believe that a Washington state existed. You weren't alone.
Just to confuse things further.... Washington is essentially a county inside the District of Columbia. That seems a bit silly now but there were originally two counties; Washington and Arlington. Arlington was returned to Virginia so while having a single county in DC with a unique name seems silly now, it was a bit less so in the past. 

Using the name Washington to refer to the District of Columbia, to people who live in the region at least, is a bit like saying you are going to Westminster instead of simply saying London (ie unnecessarily specific).
Capitol is a building. Capital is what Olympia is.
It's because people keep confusing capital ( city that holds the government) and Capitol (building that holds the Parliament).
They had a Ben and Jerry's ice cream shop on Capitol Hill in Seattle WA. I don't know if it's still there but it was in the mid to late 90's. 
What do you think they're thinking on the West Coast?
I thought the Washington Redskins played in Washington state until about third grade
Oh I see how it is, the capital has to be close to the East Coast huh? That's it, we're moving it to Kansas. Now nobody will be happy!
I sat and watched, jaw on the ground, as a TEACHER told her 3rd grade class this is Washington, the capitol of the US. *Proceeds to point to extreme NW corner of US map*
So far away from what? I hope you realize that NYC isn't the only state in the U.S.

I live in California, so when I was a kid, I used to think all of the famous large cities like Chicago and New York were all in California, since we had San Francisco and Los Angeles
You wouldn't believe how many people here believe that "New York" is the capital of the USA
Some of my relatives think I live in "Seattle, Washington DC"..
Those in Hawaii still think that.
Did you know that old New York was once New Amsterdam?
It is the city of Washington in the District of Columbia.

Fun fact, one name that was considered for the state Washington was Columbia due to the Columbia river, but they changed it to Washington to avoid confusion with the Capitol.
I was like, 12 when I realized that the Washington Redskins were based in DC and not Washington state.
Too damn hot this week... And river flooding issues?

I see it a lot around here (reddit) where people call "DC" by just the name Washington.  

I live in Baltimore and everyone around here just says "DC".

Or at least if they call it by the full name, they always follow Washington with DC. 

I could definitely see how that could get annoying for a native of Washington state.
DC United. 
Everyone from DC says DC. And I'd say most NE who have gone to or met people from the DC area say DC. I'm always correcting everyone who says Washington. Yes, you can point at the fact we have it before the sports but if you are in the know you know it's always gonna be DC. Sorry my pet peeve :)
I live in Boston and usually hear it referred to as Washington.

Washington State is known as "Seattle."
Shit I'm from Oregon and I refer to it as DC. I think it's because Dave Chapelle said it like that.

Don't their algorithms display results based on your search & browsing history, location data, etc.?

I just Googled and the top 4 results:

1. Wikipedia disambiguation page, with the state & city beneath it.

2. The Washington Post
>Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world national news, entertainment more. In-depth DC, Virginia, Maryland news coverage including traffic, ...

3. Washington.org - Official Tourism site of Washington DC

4. Access Washington - Washington State Government Info & Services

So 3 of the top 5 for me (taking the Wiki as 1-1) are DC-related. 
Probably depends on your search history and current location.
For me the first 3 hits are the Washington Post (DC news paper), WMATA (DC metro) and DC's wikipedia page.
Washington state's wikipedia page comes 4th.

I attended the weekend stuff in DC this past weekend (wasn't there yesterday because I'm in college and went with other students, so we left Sunday evening to get back to classes, plus i can't afford 50$ to get arrested lol). Saturday was the first day, which was more or less a few workshops and internal rallies intended to help people talk about the issues more accurately and to help them bring the message back home, basically to get everyone fired up a bit. Sunday we held a rally on the Mall and then did a march around the Capitol and Supreme Court building. I know that everyone who was planning on getting arrested had to attend a meeting Sunday night to go over their rights and what to do in a nonviolent protest and whatnot, I wish I could have gone to that but we had to leave before then.

Bernie's Yearning was made by Ben, it is not a Ben and Jerry ice cream but rather *Ben's best*. The company Ben and Jerry's tweeted "This was created by Ben as a citizen. The company is not involved."
The Bernie's Yearning flavor is not a "Ben & Jerry's" flavor; it's a "Ben's Best" flavor, so not related to the Unilever company.  The two of them did a radio interview a couple of days ago at WAMC, during which they talk a bit about their current activism, etc.  I didn't hear the whole interview, but [here it is](http://wamc.org/post/ben-jerry-albany-415#stream/0) in case anyone wants to listen.
And honestly they totally DO seem to have opposed Unilever on several occasions, but supposedly Unilever itself is more of an umbrella company, so the foods group itself is mostly independent of the consumer goods group (and refreshments is separate from foods, ice cream is a refreshment and B&J is under the Ice Cream subgroup inside the refreshments group.)
That's good to know. Unilever ruined Breyer's.
Its a conglomerate

civil disobedience 
I live in DC.  They are great about protests.  There are several areas that are no protest zones for obvious safety reasons.  When protesters protest in these areas they know they are going to get arrested which will bring more awareness to the cause.  Case in point, nobody would have heard about this one if Ben & Jerry didn't get arrested.  

P.S.  Visit DC.  Free museums, awesome memorials, food game is getting better. 
The right to free speech allows you to communicate with others.  It does *not* guarantee unlimited use of public land on which to do so.
You joke but 'designated protest zones' have already been imposed on people at various demonstrations; some being as far as a couple miles away from the event being protested...
Isn't that right near the free speech zone? The one that looks like a cage.
Which also happens to be the designated smoking area.

that play on words sounds awful... -ly delicious 
Courts have interpreted the constitution so that it can be relaxed to allow governments to pass "reasonable" laws, even though they may violate an absolute constitutional principal. The First Amendment protects your right to peacefully assemble - within reason. You are restricted from protesting in certain places - you cannot do things like block traffic or put others at risk because of a protest (even if it is peaceful). I think governments can also require that you apply for a permit before a large-scale protest.
The fee isn't for assembling, but for infringing on the rights of others. It is definitely possible to assemble in public without incurring a fee. However, often protestors will intentionally choose to do so in a way that gets them ticketed.
There is also a constitutional right to bear arms, but you still need to be able to stop criminals and mentally unstable people from being able to purchase them. Laws are not as "cut and dry" as a lot of people seem to think.
Ben and Jerry could pay for the whole group.

"Hey everybody, this protest is on us!"
OH sure, it's a small amount of money for the city, but the principle of it is so incredible.

They had people who are trying to use civil disobedience as a means to protest against "the role of money in politics" PAY the government, and even warn the government about their civil disobedience so the government could completely invalidate the entire point of the civil disobedience. They even perverted the very idea of "getting arrested". They're basically selling "I got arrested for protesting" vouchers instead of actually arresting people, just to not even give them that satisfaction.

It's like burning a park to protest forest fires.

EDIT: just realized it's even more ironic! They aren't paying the city, they're paying the US Capitol police! They paid $15,000 to the federal police in charge of protecting political institutions to protest money in politics for a FEW MINUTES!

>The place where they're being "arrested" is not public space and does, in fact, block entry into the building for legitimate business. Which is why they aren't "arrested" until they start going up the steps.

They block "an entry", which was agreed upon with the owners of the entry so measures could be taken to let people in anyway, at a time agreed upon with the owners so as to minimise any disruption. What they did is nothing. It's the exact equivalent of doing nothing.
On the other hand, if reddit *did* understand how it worked, it wouldn't work.  If "getting arrested" (in the really shallow and inconsequential sense that happens in these cases) was widely understood to be a routine and honestly pedestrian part of protesting strategy, everyone would yawn and ignore it.
They paid $50 a pop so they could have pictures of protesters being arrested for social media and to send to traditional media. It worked, because we're sitting here on social media talking about it.


Do they get royalties or something?
That banana ice cream is crazy addicting. The jimmy Fallon and Colbert blends are great too ;)
Well... you could just donate to their organization. Strictly speaking, you don't *need* to eat a ton of ice cream in order to fight Citizan's United.
Ben and Jerry already sold out to Unilever
My favorite Ben and jerry's is half baked and my favorite regular ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip. If you just mixed the two together.... I mean I can only get so hard.
Technically, mint is a weed.
I wouldn't doubt that many protesters *want* to be arrested. Arrests make better publicity and better media coverage - case and point, we are talking about it *right now*. 

Protest groups are well aware of these kinds of strategies.
Protesters getting arrested gets them more publicity, allows them to kinda spread their message more. People protesting get arrested and generally it'll state why, or what cause they are fighting for, and what they are protesting.

And protesters getting arrested seems to be more impactful than them just protesting elsewhere safely.

That being said, fuck people blocking traffic. Not specific to the BLM stuff, but in general. I may be sympathetic to your cause, but I still need to get to my job. As may a doctor or nurse who is stuck in traffic. But that's an entirely other story.
I mean, you *do* live in Panem by Northern VA standards.
NoVa is used regularly.
NoVa is nothing like the rest of VA, it deserves its own name.
Just abbreviating. In normal conversation I'd say Northern Virginia.
People type out Nova/NoVa/NOVA a lot. Our regional sub is /r/Nova.
Parliament? We're in America its Congress
Get outta here commies 
Can confirm there is a Ben & Jerry's at the corner of Haight-Ashbury Streets in San Francisco
There's no Ben and Jerry's on Cap Hill anymore. I think there's one in Ballard, but I'm too lazy to go there. I just go to Safeway and get the premade stuff.
We're mainly concentrating on our legal weed and unseasonably warm weather.
Some NY folks think their city is the center of the universe. I had a college friend who asked me, very seriosuly, "why the fuck don't we get k-rock (ny terrestrial radio station) here, bro?"

We were in the center of Pennsylvania 
Well the country was started on the east coast, so I'm assuming /u/oksoithought didn't understand why they settled the east coast then didn't make the capitol there.
"Thank god the capital is so far away." 
> What do you think they're thinking on the West Coast?

That the East Coast is horrible and they are glad to be as far away from it as possible.

...At least that's what I thought when I lived in the West. And still do now that I live in the East.
They sure as shit wouldn't still be the Redskins if they were in Washington state.
Future Hall of Famer Russ Grimm also thought the Redskins were in Washington state...*when they drafted him.*
Wait. They aren't?!
Welp, TIL. Never bothered to look it up. Thank you.
I'm a big football fan and I just recently found that out. I guess I never thought to question it.
Thanks for clearing that up for me
Ok, TIL.  Embarrassingly... 
I didn't know this until just now.
I see you've been to Kansas before. 
Move it to Lebanon, KS the very middle of America 
Kansas didn't exist when the capital was created.  It had to be close to the colonies, when Washington wasn't even discovered yet.
Kansas sure wouldn't be.
What were you doing hanging in a third grade classroom?
Maybe she at least spelled capital right though :)
I blame my teacher for improper use of commas. If the teacher doesn't know the subject, thousands of students get jacked for life.
What if I told you that NYC isn't a state but a city?
I'm sure he realizes NYC isn't a state in the U.S.
The irony...
It certainly would have been very far from the center of the country when it was founded. Americans hadn't even been to Washington state at that time.
Far away from the colonies.  It wasn't even a state when the capital was created, in fact we didn't even have states close to Washington. 
/u/oksoithought 's idea makes sense considering how small the USA originally was. 
I keep reading about NFL teams but you forget the name means nothing.  I'm from NYC and learned that quickly because we really have no teams other than the Bills.  Jets and Giants play and practice in NJ.
Not sure how long ago you are talking but there are Carolina Panthers, Tennessee Titans, and Arizona Cardinals. Then there is also the New England Patriots which represents an entire region. 
Human head weights 10lbs
Why'd they change it?
You made me laugh in the bathroom congratulations
Side effects may include not winning anything for a long time.
All we want is to be recognized as the most superior state. Is that so wrong?
Hell yeah MLS
Hmm, didn't know that. 

Makes sense, in a way. "F.C. <whatever>" is such a common soccer team name style that "D.C. United" fits in a way I'm not sure it would in other sports.
I do believe the joke is that Manhattan is New York and that there's no need to worry about what's outside of it.
Technically, they're IN separate counties.  

There are no counties named Brooklyn, Staten Island, or Manhattan.  Brooklyn is in Kings County, Staten Island is in Richmond County, and Manhattan is in New York County.

The Bronx and Queens are in Bronx and Queens Counties, respectively.
If GTA 4's map is what distinguishes the borders of NYC, then the whole state of New Jersey just became the sixth borough.
Slave trading was going to be banned in DC, and Alexandria, a big slave market, didn't want to give it up. Meanwhile in Virginia, abolitionists were starting to get elected to the state assembly. (This is in the lead up to the civil war.) So, Alexandria becomes part of Virginia and gets to keep the slave market while Virginia gets an influx of pro-slavery voters.

Win-win!
Money isn't important to them. They spent more money on police than they generated. The message is what is important: even when legal, do what we want or be punished, and we won't make you look like a martyr.
It costs way more to keep that many police out there..
Sounds like one of the specials from Bob's Burgers.
from an NPR politics podcast I listened to yesterday, it sounded like Ben created the Bernie's Yearning ice cream flavor. it's a mint chocolate chip ice cream with all the chocolate chips risen to the top (like money in the US), you have to break the chocolate up and "redistribute" it to other sections of the ice cream
A soapy conglomerate.
Unilever is the real world OCP. 
They also make universal leavers
*would have
> they are going to get arrested which will bring more awareness to the cause. 

It's almost as if the purpose of a protest is to bring awareness to a cause. Too bad people have to goto jail in order to accomplish this. You'd think we couldn't have figured out a better system by now.
And where they, just happen, to keep the dumpsters. 
Yeah, the applying for the permit to protest is what stuns my mind:

*Hi, may please we voice our displeasure at some of your actions?*

**No.**

*Oh, okay..*

I understand this allows the city to allocate resources to accommodate/control the protest, but then it defeats the whole purpose of civil disobedience. The techniques used by civil rights activists back 60s/70s are now useless since government has studied and made laws to render them obsolete.
It's called secondary effects.

The speech isn't the thing being regulated, it's the secondary effects of the speech, such as large crowds, litter, vandalism, etc.
I'm going to contribute to their defense fund. What flavors do you recommend?
[deleted]
True. You're right, it's more like (and just as pointless as) buying iPads to send out to journalists: after the storm in a teacup has died down, all that's actually happened is the city is up some money, due to politics.

So I fail to see how they'll turn around, once they see they're only making money by this, and go "We were wrong to involve money in politics!"
I would think that they still have some stock in the company or something considering they recently went around handing out Bernie Sanders Ice Cream in Ben and Jerry's cups.
Royalties isn't the right word here. If they are still involved with the company or are on the board or own stock, then yes, they'll make money off of someone buying a pint of ice cream in one way or another. But I'm pretty sure they aren't part of the company other than just the name.
The Tonight Dough is phenomenal. 
my favorite is new york super fudge chunk. im addicted during the spring and summer, but on a diet right now..
It sounds like people are trying to rebrand Virginia.

> No, not *that* Virginia.  The DC suburb, ~~SoDoSoPa~~ NoVa.
There are so many wrong things in this thread. People saying NYC is a state, other people thinking the Redskins played in Washington State, now this guy thinking the US has a parliament. 
You are right. Members of congress enjoy parliamentary privilege and congress uses parliamentary procedures, but it is not the same as they do not have the exact same role. Both are legislatures though, so that is the word I should have used instead of parliament. Capitol is the building that holds the legislature (elected body that makes the laws).  
Brit here. Don't you also have a senate? What's the difference between Congress and Senate, and in that case, what's the difference between a congressman/woman and a senator?
The temperature yesterday was too damn high!

Dude I just moved to Washington this week, this weather isn't normal?
> We're mainly concentrating on our legal weed

can yall stop smoking so much and help the rest of the country get some weed thanks <
Seriously. I believe it was April 4th, I was melting in my car in 92 degree heat. In the beginning of April. And it's gone from that heat to stormy, back to heat, back to stormy, back to heat again. In the Bay Area. Totally normal. 
Seriously it was 90 out I was dying
That just sounds like a basic misunderstanding of how radios work lol
You can tell because they call it "the city". THE city. The only one that matters!
Fucking K-Rock. Central NY?
With five sovereign nations and many, many more tribes on top of that, you bet your ass that'd never fly here.
Don't feel bad. Growing up when I heard people talk about the Redskins I assumed their mascot was a potato since we ate so many redskin potatoes. Even when I saw the picture of their logo I still thought they were named after potatoes, not people.
Football players don't usually get scholarships based on their grades alone...
Nope. But don't worry. They don't even play in DC.

No son. They aren't play there.
NFC East. But I guess Dallas throws that off a little. 
Or maybe you're just not as big of a football fan as you thought. 
Washington had been discovered. The people living there simply weren't sharing the delicious salmon and berries with [United States of] Americans yet.

The styling is probably "<city> United" (e.g. Sheffield United, Manchester United) rather than "FC <...>". 
Yes, the fact that they are separate counties is why if I mail something to somebody in Brooklyn I would put Brooklyn, New York instead of New York, New York.  Because those mailing systems stuck even after they all joined NYC.
Next April fools I think they should put the Bronx in the Queens county and Queens in the Bronx county. 
European here. From the movies I'd always thought Harlem was in New York too. Is it actually in a different city, or is it just not categorised as a district or county?
Live in Brooklyn, can confirm this.

NYC as is currently constituted was created in 1898. Brooklyn didn't originally want to join. Brooklyn if it was still independent today, would be the 4th largest city in the US in terms of population. 5 counties (5 boroughs).
> Manhattan is New York County

The only place where the county is inside the city. seriously guys?
Well I mean...
Plus Staten Island doesn't exist.
NJ is part of the NY Tri-State area.  Which is also sometimes referred to as the Greater NYC Area.  So its not that far from the truth I guess.
It's maybe because I'm hungry as all hell and maybe because I'm also pregnant but that sounds delicious
I thought the chocolate disk represented the black vote, which is why it was so hard for Bernie to break through it.
Not very clean though
Yes, but a look at their [brands](https://www.unilever.com/brands/?page=2) shows they while they make alot of soap they still have bought into other types of products
[deleted]
Meh. According to [Oxfam](http://www.behindthebrands.org/en/company-scorecard) Unilever is actually the most ethical one of the world's ten biggest food companies. Okay, Nestlé is a close second on that list, so maybe they're just the least evil. 
Unilever sounds like Scottish slang for schlong. 
I was so pissed when I had to buy a specific brand of leaver to use with my leaves. Wish I knew they made universal leavers beforehand.
>There *ARE several AREAS.   
  
That mistake is more erroneous to me. 
>You'd think we couldn't have figured out a better system by now.

We did. Post on reddit from the safety of your home.
But they didn't go to jail? They were processed on scene and immediately let go. In fact, as someone else pointed they are enjoying a nice lunch of fried chicken, not jail-served gruel. 
Honestly they don't stop you from protesting. KKK gets permits to protest all the time
I mean, you still can. It's just that working with authorities means they have a chance to clear streets, make sure medical cover is available, plan diversions for traffic, work out best routes and how to avoid overcrowding, etc. As opposed to people completely shutting down commerce in a city and pissing off all the drivers who are suddenly stuck in the street because of all the people walking down it.
From what I've seen, there hasn't been any instances of cities denying permits to protest. It's more of a notification for the city, so they can work together.
Alternatively 

*Hi, may we please voice our displeasure at some of your actions?*

**Sure, just let us make sure it doesn't inconvenience anyone do we can all ignore you!**


Well, seeing how this is reddit and all, I would vote for Jolly Rancher and Swamps of Dagobah.
Naturally, Americone Dream.  
Good thing the ice cream dudes were there, we would've never heard about it otherwise.
> all that's actually happened is the city is up some money, due to politics.

At the end of any protest, nothing *happens*, but a successful protest will start to change public opinion, which is a very powerful force over time.

Also, it's not like the $50 fines are being sent to Obama or some politician; it's going to pay for the extra police they need there to arrest people.
Yeah I mean they basically still ARE the actual brand.  
Would be weird if they didn't at least own some stock or something in the company.
I mean, if the worst case scenario is that they're eating Ben and Jerry's as spiritual support instead of financial support, I say go for it.
Nah, just a way to call a geographical area of Virginia something. The Confederacy had the Army of Northern Virginia, after all.


Congress is composed of two parts: the senate & the house of representatives. A member of the house would be called a congressman while a senator is from the senate. For laws to be passed, they must be approved by both.
Come to the Midwest and enjoy our sad cold winters and excessively annoying wind.
At least it's dry heat and not humid. 😅
You shut your face! 
It's supposed to be higher today. Hell I'm in shorts and a tee at 8am. It's awesome. 
Seriously what the fuck it's April man
Boo hoo.

I almost had heat stroke on my motorcycle coming home from work yesterday.  My jacket was still setup for winter riding, the 88 degrees caught me off guard.
Come to our weather in Arizona! Toasty 115°
I thought congress said no to their legal weed? 
Not until July or August, no.
He lacked a basic understanding for most things
Isn't it KROQ? Out an I talking about a completely different station?
Oh god, it's awful. They play 'let the bodies hit the floor' at least once a day.

Seattle is a bastardized version of a beloved Native American chief. They put up with a lot out here.
Yeah, what's with all the controversy surrounding their name? What do people have against potatoes?
And the New York teams play in New Jersey.
That was exactly my reasoning! 
Pfft. You don't know him. For all you know, he might make bathroom scales tremble with fear. He could be the *biggest* fan, for all we know. :)
He's probably from East Virginia.
No, dummy. Africa has two countries: North Africa and South Africa. Geez.
I knew people in junior high and high school that were dumbfounded when I told them places like Japan and Vietnam weren't cities or provinces or some shit in the giant nation of China that encompassed all of central Asia.
That's not true. New York  is just a stupidly large area for the city field of mail.
And anyway only zip code matters for getting to the right post office.
It's like Toronto. We have 6 boroughs and you have to specify which one when mailing or applying for shipping online. I could never write Toronto, ON, I have to write Etobicoke, ON. 
Harlem's just a neighborhood.

Like Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side, SoHo, TriBeCa, Nolita, etc.
None of those. Harlem is a neighborhood located in Manhattan. 
5 counties inside the city, actually, but yes, Manhattan Island is most of New York County- when they named the counties, they didn't see what would happen.

Clearly very people in this thread have much experience with U-Line or Aramark.
I grew up in the south and one of my political science professors explained it with using a real world example. There was a big civil rights thing going on in the 90s that resulted in black folks being very upset. The KKK filed for permission to hold a rally. Their choice of time and location was in a heavily poor black residential area, near a prominent black church, shortly after Sunday worship services would be ending. The city government gave them permission to hold the rally at a more suburban population center at the same time instead, citing concern that violence would erupt. 

In this case, it seems pretty clear that the intent was to incite violence, which is the major restriction to the freedom of speech written in the bill of rights. 
But they can and that is what matters, the government has done terrible and wonderful things we cannot assume they will do either but we should restrict their power so they cannot do many of the things they are currently capable of.

Edit: My first ever gold! Thank you kind redditor!!
You are responding to an article where 300 people were arrested and fined $50 for participating in a protest. 
Dont those thjngs actually limit the impact that protesting would have?
If a protest didn't inconvenience anyone, then what's the point? 
Don't you fucking bring jolly rancher into this. Nope, nope, nope, nope. 
They probably sold the controlling majority and kept a minority stake in the company in order to retire, make money by retiring, and still make money after retiring. Livin' the dream.
Just give me an excuse to eat ice cream, people!
40mph winds here all last week, yay Nebraska 
[deleted]
Yeah, but no mountains :( 
So is an oven, but I don't want to sit in there either
Yeah, fuck that! If it was crazy humid too I'd be halfway to Alaska already
The dryness doesn't matter when you work in a kitchen with no a/c. 118 all day..
Miami-based and not looking forward to the summer...
I love humid weather. Feels great on my skin. Not everyone dislikes it lol. I like heat in general but humid is better for me than dry. 
I think I'm going to melt today...
Yeah but they doubled down on the unseasonably warm weather
You thought wrong. [It is legal... Sort of.](http://mpdc.dc.gov/marijuana)
Did you have to explain why your onion was yellow to the poor dude too?
That one's out in LA I think...new York city had one and they were both owned by the same company so they'd steal promos from eachother....also a bunch of major cities had a krock at some point I think
The name was adapted from Sealth out of respect. It was considered disrespectful to say the name of a dead man among the tribes. 
Except the Bills. The only true NY team.
Well, not yet anyway...
It has sort of happened before:  Reminds me of the "protest cages" that have been set up at both DNC and RNC conventions in the past.  Our glorious two parties work with local cops to contain pesky dissenters.

They build an actual little cage, far from view, and you can sign up for 5 minutes "protest time" to march around in it with a sign.  Protest anywhere else near the convention, and you get arrested.

"Time and place restrictions" - that's what our masters call it.
They could have easily got permits and done it legally but they decided to get arrested/fined as a publicity stunt. They have said this themselves.
Making some people feel like they did something, when in reality they did nothing.
hmm. raising awareness? idk. never protested.
actually this was in our business analysis course. Ben & Jerry sold the company because they coulnt afford to run the company while doing social affairs, and selling it was the only option to keep the company from going down. It was a famous case for stakeholder theory versus shareholder value maximization.
At least your 40mph winds don't come with sand that flies at you so hard it feels like little needles :(
Chicago might be your best option. No wind ever. Scout's honor. 
Two tomatoes sitting in an oven. One turns to the other and says "Sure is hot in here." The other turns and says "Holy shit! A talking tomato!"
Stop in BC on the way. You might not keep going. 
Which is odd considering how hot and humid it gets in the interior of Alaska. If you stick to the coast you should be fine, but that's true in WA as well.
It's unseasonably warm here, too. Your best bet is probably Antarctica. 
It was hotter in Seattle yesterday than it was in  Miami, Phoenix, and Honolulu o_0
I had to sleep with the window open last night. What the actual fuck, Washington state?!
It was because of the war 
Ironically enough, the call letters for the station are WBMP, and there's a long story with all of the call letters that they've had... WMCA -> WHOM -> WKTU -> WXRK -> WFNY -> WNOW-FM -> WBMP

They still call it "K-Rock" though, based on their format, not the call letters.
Got a source on that? "Seattle"" is actually a much closer transliteration of his original name "ˈsiʔaːɬ". That lowercase "L" with the little loop is pronounced just like you would at the end of Seattle as currently said, but without voicing (using your vocal chords) on the last syllable. The spelling using a "th" at the end implies a θ pronunciation (like in the word through) instead of ɬ, for which there is no exact English equivalent.
I'm pretty sure that's not true. And if so then Chief Sealth High School is a pretty insensitive  name.
And the only team to lose 4 Super Bowls in a row, those poor bastards. I can't imagine having a team good enough to even go to 4 Super Bowls in a row, but still not good enough to win any of them.
Which people don't know because they are called the Buffalo Bills. 
I personally protested at one of those conventions, in public, in front of the convention, without a permit, and without going to the silly cage that was in the bad part of town. No one arrested me. I wish they had because then I'd be even madder than I am now.

We need a revolution. That is the only answer to these problems.
> It's tempting to consider value simply as a matter of maximizing the short-term financial performance of the organization, says Jensen. Contending with that value maximization approach is "stakeholder theory" which says that managers should make decisions so as to take into account all of the interests of all stakeholders in a firm.  
  
A summary for the rest of us mortals.
What was in your business analysis course was way off the mark. I hope you didn't pay much to take it.

A couple of articles I found with background and discussion (second is literally a response to the first):

* http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_truth_about_ben_and_jerrys
* http://www.csrwire.com/blog/posts/560-some-real-truth-about-ben-jerrys-a-lawyer-s-perspective

I.e. the situation was sell or get sued. By *get sued*, I mean to the point where the litigation costs so much that you go out of business because the other guy has infinitely deeper pockets than you do. The other guy is a specific set of shareholders. Corporate law says you're beholden to the shareholders. I believe benefit corporations came about because of the risk of such lawsuits if any given business decides to take on similar stakeholder goals as Ben & Jerry's once did. The company easily could have kept operating if no one ever sought to acquire them.

I too have lived in the High Desert.
I thought they were suppose to be muffins...who puts tomatoes in the oven? 
We're not Chicago. People can leave. We don't murder them all.

Or maybe he wore it on his belt so long t changed color.
Well, it does say that it was considered disrespectful in the past, so maybe it is considered respectful now?
Note they did *not* claim that the tea was free of pesticides.  They only claimed that their tea was "safe". 

Big difference.
